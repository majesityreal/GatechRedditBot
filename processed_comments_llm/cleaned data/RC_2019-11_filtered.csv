&gt;The national average for college campuses is roughly between 6.5 and 7.5 suicides per 100,000 students, according to [three major studies](http://www.sprc.org/sites/sprc.org/files/library/SuicideAmongCollegeStudentsInUS.pdf) that looked at undergraduate and graduate student suicides from 1980 to 2009.  
&gt;  
&gt;At least one other local school, Harvard University, has an above average rate for its  undergraduate population. The rate of suicide at Harvard was 11.8 per 100,000 undergraduates over the past decade. When accounting for both undergraduates and graduates, the rate at Harvard was 5.4 per 100,000.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2013, the United States reported 13 suicides per 100,000 people, an increase from a rate of about 11 a decade earlier.  
&gt;  
&gt;Among college-age people, the rate has increased from 11 per 100,000 a decade ago to 11.6 in 2013, according to data provided by the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the University of Pennsylvania, six students committed suicide between the fall of 2013  and the fall of 2014, according to media reports. And at Cornell, six students committed suicide during the 2009-2010 school year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Globe this month reached out to more than three dozen other major colleges and  universities around the country ‚Äî many of which are identified as peer  institutions of MIT ‚Äî requesting that they share information about the  number of student suicides at their campuses over the past two decades.  As of Friday, only three schools ‚Äî Harvard, Worcester Polytechnic  Institute, and Boston College ‚Äî had provided the data.  
&gt;  
&gt;Twenty-three of the schools declined to participate. Some, including the University  of Pennsylvania, said that their institutions had not collected the data  and had no way of gathering it now; others expressed concern about  comparing figures between colleges, noting that some institutions may  have different standards and methods for collecting data on suicide.  
&gt;  
&gt;The rest of the schools either did not respond or some, like Cornell, said they were still working on the request.

&gt;Over the past decade, at least nine Columbia undergraduates took their own lives, seven of whom were students of color. This comprises a rate  of 11 students per 100,000 student years (a ""student year"" is calculated as a year a student spends at Columbia).

&gt;Nationally, the suicide rate among 15- to 24-year-olds has increased modestly but steadily since 2007: from 9.6 deaths per 100,000 to 11.1, in 2013 (the latest year available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).",Neutral,"suicide rates, college students, mental health, social media, statistics",1,2019-11-01

This will turn around. Take care of yourself and be kind to yourself. Tons of clubs recruit in the spring too, so the worst case scenario is that this lasts a few more weeks until after the holidays. You can totally handle that. A few weeks is a piece of cake. 

As for clubs, check out the radio station. I think they pretty much always let people start and they‚Äôre a pretty welcoming group of people (or at least they were before I graduated). If you‚Äôre religious, a lot of those clubs can be a good starting place, and absolutely go to homecoming things for your dorm this weekend. If they have a mini 500 team or anything like it, go cheer with people on your hall. Wake up and walk the cake race with someone new. Those traditions are made for goofy first meeting stories.

I was really depressed as a freshman and felt that everyone around me had ‚Äúfound‚Äù their circles and I never did. Now i‚Äôm a third year and i won‚Äôt say i‚Äôm ‚Äúcured‚Äù but i have a LOT more going for me now. 

Tech is hard, really really hard. But the opportunities you get here are incomparable to any other experience. As a third year now, I‚Äôve gone abroad, gotten a co-op, I‚Äôm in a really happy relationship and all of those things couldn‚Äôt have happened without the lows

It‚Äôs ok to feel sad and lonely, and it can also be really hard, but if you can use those times of sadness to motivate you to change the parts of your life you dislike. Go abroad, take some classes outside of your major with more discussions as opposed to straight lecture. Your journey has JUST begun, hang in there because as you go through your time it could get a LOT better

An element of college that is really difficult is being on your own, having to take care of yourself by yourself, and overall being an adult. it‚Äôs a huge adjustment and can stir a lot of negative emotions and difficult times but you are LEARNING!

Homework questions were graded with a check plus, check, check minus scale when I took it, and you had 10 days to work on each homework, so they're roughly biweekly. Midterm was mid March.

However, if you have say 6 easy credit hours worth of classes set aside for next semester, I'd recommend getting 4317 out of the way along with 4107.

So blockchain is unique because there is a profit incentive to lie, be wrong, or just overstate results and understate negatives. Actual blockchain is super simple. It can be done in like 40 minutes. The term ""whitepaper"" used to mean something that isn't peer reviewed, so be cautious. Now everyone only publishes white papers and they can't bother for peer review. Whitepapers are written to be persuasive, instead of technical and formal. Everyone thinks you can put garbage into a latex template, and it'll be legit, but its still garbage. 

This is why for the class we choose to focus and good foundations for crypto, and other technologies. Zero knowledge is important for Zcash and newer chains. Multiparty computation will always be important. 

Instead of a final, we will have a research project, 5-10 page paper on anything from blockchain. A lot of students choose to analyze some whitepaper at a level beyond the whitepaper themselves. Some do formal papers, like this one for [example](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/528.pdf) I would say is at the harder end, but not unintelligible to students by the end of the class.

comment,"Oh, so you want to take 1331 as well? That class can be a bit of a timesink, particularly the homeworks. Final homework is the one that threw me for a loop (fuck JavaFX), and I took Java in high school. If you know how to code Java, I wouldn't worry as much, but otherwise it may be a bit more difficult for you. I'd recommend finding a course online somewhere to at least get the general ideas surrounding OOP if it's new to you. Also, from what I've gathered, take the online version of 1331, it seems like it's paced in such a way that all of the lectures leading up to the exam are released, you take the exam, then rinse and repeat after the exam. Plus I just really like online classes, they make life easier in a lot of ways in my opinion.

Anyway, what I was suggesting is, if I were in your position, get 4107 and 4317 out of the way, then take 1331 and whatever else your heart desires that won't cause you to die of explosively high blood pressure.

However, if you don't want to take analysis and algebra at the same time (which would be totally understandable), then I'd go for 3406, 3235, and 4107 all together. With 1331 it would likely be manageable.

In regards to the question about 3406, I may be a bit biased cause if you take the TR section you'll see me there, but it's totally up to you and when you like to get up in the morning.

I decided to look up the professors out of curiosity, you would actually have a good professor for 3235 (I had Bonetto for 3670, he was pretty decent, very Italian) and for 4107 (Heil is the absolute sweetest professor and he's great at explaining concepts, I had him for like a month for 4317, dropped because it turns out CS 4540 is downright murderous with Abernethy, unfortunately 4540 is the one I need to graduate). I can't remember if Belegradek or Loss are good off the top of my head for 3406, and idk the 4317 professor, so that'd be a gamble.

comment,"I have a *little* experience with Java....did take CS in high school and pass the AP Comp Sci A exam (miracle, may I add). Teacher wasn't great so I didn't learn much, but I think I have an okay enough foundation where I won't get caught completely off guard. I've accepted 1331 will be a good timesink for me....I mean, it's gonna be a timesink whether I take it now, next semester, or in ten years.

As for online- in the past online classes have been rough for me as I don't hold myself accountable and procrastinate it. However, do you think the class content for the online version is good enough or better than what I could learn from a professor in-person? I am considering a CS-related minor so I'm not only taking this class for the credit/grade, but also to really learn the material.

I think I'll stick with 3235 and 4107, because like you said the professor looked pretty good, and also because 3235 is a bridging course for other stuff I'll want to take (also bc concentrating in prob/stat). 4317 for next semester

My question regarding the two class times for 3406 wasn't necessarily about waking up early (I have a 10:10 MWF rn and it's just fine)- it's just that I want to make sure if I drop the MWF class right now and get on the waitlist for TR, that I have a high chance of getting into the class. Given it's only phase I, I'm sure I'll be fine but just confirming with you. I'm still a rookie to registering so waitlists get me nervous.... (also, 3235 and 4317 are only offered at one time this semester, and it's the exact same time, so I have to choose and not do both, so no backup plan if I don't get into 3406 TR, if that makes any sense.)

I‚Äôm currently a junior and honestly I only have a couple close friends and those are my roommates. My first two years at Tech I completely isolated myself and it really took a toll on my mental health. This semester I decided to try the counseling center because I wanted to try and work towards acknowledging my mental health issues and finding ways to cope with them. Personally, I really enjoy my counseling sessions. It keeps me accountable and it‚Äôs a great place to vent and just seek what I need. It doesn‚Äôt solve everything obvious, but it can really be a great motivator to help push you in the right direction.

I‚Äôve really struggled with making friends here too, and honestly I really only have like two REAL friends after being here for 2 years..but you know that‚Äôs okay. Making friends is hard for some people, and I think it can definitely be much harder when you‚Äôre a freshman and this whole experience is so new to you.

My advice is to hold on. Keep going and try and be positive. Put yourself out there more. Reach out to your roommate. Reach out to the people in your clubs. Try out the counseling center...and even though you‚Äôre not confident in yourself, try your best to push yourself out of your comfort zone. Sometimes the only way to make friends is to do that.

I still struggle with so much and a lot of the time feel like I don‚Äôt have friends...because I don‚Äôt have a massive amount of them..and I don‚Äôt go out to parties...etc...but in reality, the friends that I do have are so amazing and it‚Äôs really more about quality than quantity.

Feel free to reach out to me! You‚Äôre definitely not alone. So many people go through this, but it can and will get better.",Positive,"personal experiences, mental health, making friends",1,2019-11-01

comment,"I can't tell you the difference. I can tell you that I'm in 3210 right now, a semester from graduating, and out of my two degrees 3210 is hands down, unequivocally, the worst class I have taken at tech.  No guidance, hard for stupid reasons, unreasonable workload.  Unless you want to work on operating systems at GTRI like the professors, the class is way to involved.

It's actually graded pretty nicely and getting a good grade isn't ""hard"" if you're willing to put in a stupid amount of work.

My favorite part is the refusal of professors and TAs to help in office hours / Piazza.  They'll just tell you to go figure it out yourself.  Pretty much every instructor answer on Piazza is ""ah I see you don't understand, think about it more"".

A paraphrased quote from a TA when a student asked for guidance trying to figure out how many pages to allocate for something.  Student commented how he was allocating too many pages than could fit in memory (but for good reason).  

""well it's more than one, but less than what you have.  Also if you are only this far you won't finish the lab.  I'm going to bed so no more questions""

But there is a reason we get people killing themselves in their hovels called dorms every year just saying

The majority of engineers I have worked with did not go to Tech. Many went to local engineering schools in their part of the country that I had not heard of. And yet I met many who were better engineers than many Tech engineers, and also got paid the same salary. The Tech degree is only more valuable in the heads of Tech students and alums. No one else cares that it is hard or that the professors joke about failing students or not giving a shit about them.

comment,"Not necessarily.   
My GPA improved substantially after transferring despite coming from a relatively easy school.   
For me it helped a ton to get core classes, excessive partying, and general slackerism out of my system in my first two years elsewhere and then come to Tech with a much more mature approach.   
Also helped a lot to start with a clean slate.

comment,"It really does, and I'm so sorry. If this is really what you want, then definitely try again. The worst than can happen is they say no, after all. And don't be afraid to appeal! I know a few people who were denied at first but admitted with the appeal!

I'm a second year, but I had a hard time getting here. I applied early admission into one of the less popular engineering programs as a hs senior and was flat out denied, so I appealed. They told me it'd be 1-2 weeks for that result to come back, and 5 weeks later I was again rejected. And my twin sister got in on her first try, which added a lot of insult to a very deep injury.

I went out of state for my first year and struggled a lot there. I wasn't happy, and I was still hurting from having my sister get everything I ever wanted. And I was in my school's hardest major (ChemE), which exasperated everything. I started the application to transfer as soon as it opened, but I had a lot of issues with it and not being able get answers from anyone at GT. I got it finished and submitted about 2 days before it was due.

Then I got waitlisted. I had a C in calculus 2 and a very low B in general chemistry 2, which they probably saw as a huge risk. I broke down sobbing in those two classes more than once, but I made it through with low As. So I sent the final transcript to GT to show how I had improved over the course of the semester.

I found out over Father's Day weekend that I got in. My entire ordeal still hurts a lot, and I still have a lot of anger and resentment towards GT, my college advisor/guidance counselor from hs (he was a dick who sabotaged a few of my college applications), and even my own sister. But I also had so many great things happen to me out of state. I have friends I consider to be family, and I go see them frequently. My pain was worth it; I was and am exactly where I'm supposed to be. I just had to wait a little longer, and I suspect this is where you are right now. Be patient and don't give up.

comment,"Our defense was low key fire. 4 takeaways and countless 3rd down stops.

Sadly their defense shut our offense down. Because if our offense was even remotely competent today, we'd have won easy.

Our defense looked great today and our offense has had its moments this year. I think with continued coaching and discipline, experience, and the incoming top-25 recruiting class we have a solid shot at not sucking in 2021 or maybe even 2020. Keep in mind we never have as good recruiting classes as what we've got coming up, and the current squad is full of players recruited and trained in a highly unconventional offense being asked to adapt a system that's foreign to them. The transition will take some time.

We also have a couple standouts. Skill-wise, Jordan Mason might be a top-5 RB nationally; very few running backs have his vision and his balance. If he were on a good team he'd be putting up Heisman numbers right now. In addition, Ahmarean Brown has shown a lot of speed and talent as a playmaking receiver. I think we have a few tools and we're on the right path, and I'm pretty excited to see our team over the next few years.",Positive,"football, defense, offense, coaching, discipline, experience, recruiting, transition, standouts, running backs, receivers, playmaking.",36,2019-11-02

comment,"Plan your internship and co-op semesters carefully!! Certain classes are only offered certain semesters, and this also may change in the future if the department rearranges things. Work with an advisor frequently to stay on track with a plan to graduate in 6 academic semesters!

For example, as of right now, Senior Capstone (4530) is only offered in spring and summer. CHBE 2120 &amp; 2130 are only offered in fall and spring semesters. CHBE 3200 &amp; 3130 are offered spring and fall in Atlanta but only offered abroad at GTL during summer. CHBE 4411 Process Control Lecture must be taken before or during the Process Control Lab, but the lecture isn't offered during summer. 

If you decide to go biotech option (I don't recommend it for graduating quickly as the course requirements are more strict), then CHBE 4310 Bioprocess Engineering is required and only offered in fall, and must be taken after CHBE 4300 (Semester 4 on your list).

I went to a lot of club meetings that I never returned to, but I'm happy that I went if for no other reason than that I figured out it wasn't for me. I found out what I liked, changed my major, and haven't looked back.

OP, it sounds like you feel unfulfilled from your college life. You say that you ""don't have any reason to improve on yourself, because you're in a relatively good spot,"" but you say that only after you list a bunch of things you'd want to change about yourself, so I'm not sure I buy that (and I'm not sure you do either).

A lot of my own growth at Tech came from being willing to put myself out there and make mistakes, try new things, etc. Tech is great place for it! Atlanta is a vibrant city and Tech has a diverse array of people to meet and things to do.

If you feel like you missed the boat on going out and figuring out who you really are - and when you figure out who you are and you can love yourself for it, those things that you're worried about will follow suit - don't worry! There will be plenty of opportunities to do that no matter where you go after college.

But that's not to say you still can't get started today. There's always something new to experience at Tech - you should make the most of it while you're here.",Positive,"personal growth, college life, self-discovery, opportunities.",6,2019-11-04

I'm going to talk to them again soon about grief counseling due to death in the family... We'll see what they say.

I think it's really important to remember that many people try multiple counselors/therapists before they find one who really works for them. So **even if** GT had the resources to treat every student who walked in the door, the specific people they have on staff may not even be the right fit for many students. But that doesn't mean they shouldn't let us try.

comment,"&gt;I just want to clarify that just because we have freedom of speech under the first amendment doesn't mean we have freedom from consequences.

You are correct that it doesn't grant you freedom from consequences, except for one detail, which is that Tech is a public school. Since it's run by the State of Georgia, it is under the same obligation to respect the 1st Amendment rights of students and others. It cannot treat people differently, or punish students for speech allowed to others, as doing so would constitute government censorship and a 1st Amendment violation. While the 1st Amendment doesn't protect you from consequences from private entities, it absolutely should protect you from consequences from Tech.

&gt;how often is the case where a woman's life is in danger

if abortion is banned then the woman's life is in significantly more danger because illegal abortions are more  deadly. (https://www.guttmacher.org/perspectives50/abortion-and-after-legalization) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12340404)  In case you're referring to legal abortions right now, over 50,000 cases of Severe Maternal Morbidity are diagnosed every year (https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-complications.html) High-risk pregnancies make up 6-8% of all pregnancies (https://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/high-risk_pregnancy/)

&gt;or a child will be born abnormal.
that depends on how you define abnormal. If we are talking birth defects, they happen in 3% of live births so we can assume they are more common if we include all pregnancies (https://mchb.hrsa.gov/chusa14/health-status-behaviors/infants/birth-defects.html).

comment,"The ""right to free speech"" is a human right and a principle, independent of government.  The 1st amendment only enshrines that right in US law, but to pretend like it ends firmly at the what the government cannot do is to show a lack of dedication to the principle and why it exists.

Power exists, independent of government, in corporations, schools, social networks, communities, clubs, etc.  Free speech is generally not protected by law in any of these places, yet it's principle is widely practiced.  Of course, it needs to be nuanced, but maintaining free speech as a principle makes a stronger and more just society.

Jumping straight to eliminating speech you don't like very rarely has a positive impact for anyone.  If the ideas are really as weak as you think they are, they shouldn't thrive in free and open debate.  Doesn't mean you specifically have to debate them, but clamping down on speech makes it harder for other people, especially those closer in culture to them, to deradicalize.

&gt;I think this is negatively affecting campus life, at least when it comes to random people showing up and protesting extremely outdated beliefs about homosexuals and abortion.

It's not, you're just overreacting.  Guess what?  There are people who disagree with you in the world.  Abortions happen and they're not pretty.  People want you to pay attention and agree with them.  Welcome to the adult world.

&gt;These people do not have the right to walk up to our students to harass them

""Our students""?  You don't own your fellow students, nor do you get to speak on behalf of them.  Speak for yourself.

Harassment is illegal but confronting you with what happens in an abortion is not.

&gt;NOR the right to display very explicit pictures of dead fucking infants

Interesting how you can call the aborted fetuses ""dead infants"", ""gore"", and ""dead babies"", then claim ""you don't need to be graphic to make a point"".  The point of the posters is for you to internalize that abortions are the same as killing babies.  If you don't make that connection, you internalize it as just removing ""a clump of cells"".  Again, I want to keep abortion legal but their reasoning is fairly sound and showing aborted fetuses is totally valid, if not for legal reasons but because they want to discourage women from choosing a abortion for themselves.

&gt;How is this legal and why should encouraging an environment like this in any way healthy? Being subjected to the name-calling, body-shaming, sex-shaming, moral-shaming is not what I came to this campus to achieve. I understand the reason to have a space to allow people to express their believes, but there are boundaries.

comment,"Mainly with them it was doctored photos and misinformation on how abortions are conducted.  My biggest issue is they focus on late term abortions (&gt;15 weeks) which compose less than 6% of abortions.  They make it appear like most abortions were late term and wouldn't discuss why these abortions are being sought.

They also discussed how doctors would crush the fetus' skull (true) while leaving out that the fetus was drugged into an unconscious state first.  But them being disingenuous doesn't mean they should be removed from campus.  I only believed they should have been removed from campus for blocking people's paths and assaulting people (verbal and physical confrontations) though I heard they stopped physically blocking/touching people many years ago.  I'm not informed on the current situation with them.

comment,"&gt; Being challenging and being difficult are not the same. 

Exactly! I don't mind challenging coursework, but I do mind the school making my life difficult as a result of malice/incompetence/negligence. It's fine if an assignment is hard to figure out because I'm not knowledgeable about the subject (to an extent, professors do need to teach!) but not fine if the assignment is impossible because of contradictions/mistakes in the instructions or the assignment is broken for some other reason and the professor never bothered to verify the assignment still works before assigning it.

Regarding campus in general, it makes my life much harder when I can't catch a bus because then I have to burn energy and time walking across campus to class, especially if it's very cold, raining, or both. I also strongly dislike when we are harassed by protestors, such as when people put up posters of objectively disturbing medical gore. Additionally, many campus departments are poorly managed. It's not uncommon for the GT post office to give other people packages intended for me or for the SC food court cashiers to overcharge people (last fall I checked my buzzfunds statements and they charged me $9.99 for every purchase). Last year GT dining in west village got a few people so sick with contaminated food they had to go to the hospital and GT denied any responsibility in the clear face of guilt.

Once you have said it you can be punished for what you have said. John Adams notably pushed for the passing of a sedition law and succeeded. The sedition law wasn‚Äôt unconstitutional but it was unpopular and that is at least a part of why John Adams was a single term President. It has since become politically nonviable to pass sedition laws as sweeping legislation. The protection against prior restraint isn‚Äôt absolute either. For example, the government can prevent you from broadcasting troop movements or the identities of foreign assets. 

There are other quirks in Supreme Court and lower court ruling that imply some forms of post restraint could constitute prior restraint in the future since it acts as a source of Government intimidation.

We did this at 8 a.m. so it would have the least impact (we‚Äôre at 24-hour organization). If I remember correctly, there were maybe six other people in the room and we made a point to apologize to everyone there and explain what was happening.

I spent a *lot* of time this summer trying to polish my resume as well as doing Leetcode, it's without a doubt the best technical prep (you don't really need LC premium).

I know this advice can feel a bit vague, so if you have any questions feel free to ask! If you'd like me to critique your resume and/or see mine, shoot me a DM. I can also give a few resources for where to start with Leetcode/technical prep if that helps as well!

comment,"3.91 GPA senior, this is my strategy as well.  If I were to rank some of the things you mentioned (aside from the obvious like make sure you eat a lot and sleep, and don't worry about gaining a bit of chub if you're going for great grades)

1. Doing lots of practice problems to prep for tests. This includes reviewing ALL homework and as many old tests as you can. You should be able to look at the questions on the exam and be able to mentally do every single part automatically.
1. Review slides and pay attention to detail. If you're not detail oriented, become detail oriented. Think of how and why questions and be able to answer them.
1. Go to class. Every class. Even if your friends say you should skip 4180 lecture. ECE 3056 potpourri questions on the final were almost all remarks/asides made in lecture. With that said, put your phone down and close your laptop and pay attention. Yes it's very hard but you're also paying too much money to be here. ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. Don't be afraid to nail professors with multiple questions if you don't understand. Chances are everyone else also doesn't understand and they're just afraid to show it.
1. For classes with recitation (especially hard intro classes like CS 1331) , go to the damn recitation. Stop making excuses. Sit in the front row and engage the TAs. Go to help desk if you're not good at programming instead of suffering alone in your room like I did and taking days to do a simple assignment.
1. Email your professor if you're struggling and try to be sincere with them. Let them know you've been busting your ass but you're just not getting it and need more help. They may offer you the chance to redo a homework or two or give your grade special consideration after the final if you show improvement. Be transparent with personal issues, especially illness.

What didn't work for me:

1. Plus sessions
1. Studying in groups (one study buddy is ok)
1. Taking breaks or going out for ""me time"" during crunch time. I've seen this blow up in the face of many of my friends because they decide they don't really care that much about studying and then get fucked by the test. Finals and projects suck but you need to keep pushing to get out of hell
1. Trying to learn math taught in Chinese...
1. Trying to learn MATLAB as my first programming language. I killed the final and got a B somehow? Try to take another CS class first, I think 1301 would have been better for a total newbie like me.
1. Taking grades personally. Some professors, like JH (you'll know him if you have to take one of his classes) plain suck and you won't score well because the exams are ball busters for any number of reasons, including the fact the professor forgot to teach one of the topics on the exam.","Positive

But same to you, I'm introverted. It has never changed. But I found people. Lovely human beings who I have deep personal relationships with, years later despite our differences.

I made friends with a lot of natural extroverts, one especially, who challenged my mechanisms in fun and refreshing ways. Literally, how does being social recharge someone? His bread and butter. Extroverts have stronger networks; introverts have deeper networks. We balance.

The key is to put yourself into situations which challenge your social abilities and withdrawal response. Be open. Have fun. Show up to a meeting for a club of interest even though you're scared shitless. A lot of the introverted finding extroverts comes from us putting ourselves into new positions.

Some of my keys when I don't know what to say have been to ask others about themselves. People enjoy others having interest in them. So when you feel awkward, ask a question, ""major are you studying?"" And listen. Let them answer. ""Cool. I'm studying x."" Talk some. Rinse, repeat.

comment,"These are just a few general guidelines, but there's a lot of other good advice online.

* Think of your resume like an advertisement for yourself: why should the recruiter pick YOU to move forward in the process versus potentially thousands of other applicants? Modesty is often a valuable trait, but I see too many people underselling themselves on resumes. Don't lie of course, but if you somehow created an app that has 1M+ downloads that has an Internet search engine algorithm beating Google's, generating $1B in revenue, how is the recruiter going to know any of this when all you say on your bullet point is ""Created an app with a search engine to look up information""?
* Start off your bullet points with strong action verbs like developed, deployed, implemented, etc. Make it clear *what* you did, what the *impact* was, and *how* you accomplished it.
* Make your resume easy to read and scan over. People overestimate how much their recruiter cares about them. Think about it, they see upwards of 100+ resumes every day, they probably won't spend more than 5-30 seconds on yours, probably even less if it's badly formatted. It's most preferable to use a predefined resume template as many online ones are successful and easy on the eyes. I suggest LaTeX based PDF resumes.
* When defining what the impact was, quantify it using metrics wherever possible. Instead of saying ""I made this algorithm faster"", say something along the lines of ""Improved \[x\] algorithm with \[y technology\] by 20%/30 mins per day/etc."" or note if there's a monetary gain through your work, if you have access to any of those numbers.",Positive,job application,6,2019-11-06

Afterwards it is up to you to practice LeetCode and hopefully you get lucky or if you are just naturally good at CS you will make it through the interview. Practice makes perfect though. 


I practiced over 400 LC questions and by far it was way more important than any of my classes for getting into the big N. If you do not have the time, I'd recommend buying LeetCode Premium and being laser-focused on the questions tagged for the company you are interviewing at.


If you don't know anyone I'd recommend posting on teamblind or getting a referral through repher.me. There are plenty of people who will help you get a referral to at least 1 of the big N in most cases. 


EDIT: By the way, just because you didn't apply early does not mean you have little chance. Keep applying, I know one person who got their Amazon offer at around March so it is never too late.

&amp;#x200B;

Getting a job at a big N company isn't nearly as difficult as it seems - there is some luck involved, but it is pretty doable with a bit of prep. There are two things you need to worry about - getting the interview, and passing the interview(s). Here's what I would do if I were you:

Getting the interview (resume stuff)

1. Make sure different people think your resume is polished - sounds vague, but the best way to approach resume building is to speak to maybe 3 or 4 different people who have seen a good amount, and then look at what changes you want to make. Resume dos and don'ts are really arbitrary with a few exceptions so make sure you focus on ironing out any major flaws. Speaking to different people helps you create something that is flexible and easy to read (easy to read is key). I definitely recommend going to CoC career services.

2. Be detailed, but not too detailed - a few buzzwords for projects are good, but make sure you definitely know what you're talking about. Definitely list technologies alongside the projects you used them for - 'knowing' Java isn't the same as having created something reasonably substantial with java. You need to come across as someone who knows what they are doing. Read what you write and make sure it sounds impressive but not bullshit-ey.

3. For projects, personal projects are good (and almost always beat class projects, unless you designed your own project for the class), but are far more impressive if people are actively using them, or they got you a hackathon win. Make sure the projects listed are cool, or at the very least interesting. Imagine reading the hundredth todo list project versus something that maybe uses a cool algorithm for some image processing - this is the stuff that would make you stand out. Bonus points if the projects you list use different technologies, since big N companies tend to value generalists.

4. Don't use phrases like big data, blockchain or ML unless you genuinely know what you're doing - you don't want to come across as cringey.

5. List your GPA unless it's under 3. (another arbitrary rule I made up - the point here is to always et a second opinion)

6. When speaking to recruiters, be likeable, be yourself, and treat the recruiter as a human being - doing so can't harm you, and people want to hire people that would be good to work with. It's okay to joke around as long as it's in good taste - just don't be that weirdo who prepares jokes about their resume in advance.

7. Referrals - referrals can help, especially if it's from someone you've worked with or someone who graded your work/

&amp;#x200B;

Passing the interview

Firstly, for behavioral stuff, make sure you think over some examples for the generic behavioral questions, but don't memorize or rehearse them - talk through them in a normal way. Having multiple examples for each helps. (I recommend at least 2) Treat it more like a conversation rather than a super serious interview since most tech companies are pretty relaxed, and (at least subliminally) it tells the interviewer you would be a good culture fit.

Remember, any technical interview is also in some sense a behavioral interview, so try to relax, not act like a robot and have fun during your technical interviews as well - it also makes solving the problem easier.

Here's the biggie - preparing for technical interviews.

IMO (and many people disagree with me about this) grinding hundreds of Leetcode questions isn't worth the large amount of time it takes, and doing just a handful for interview practice is very risky. I also don't think it's very fun, and it makes it difficult for me to sit down and do. that being said, you should still do a small handful, but not for interview practice - just so you are familiar with coding in these environments because sometimes companies send out coding challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

There are for aspects of technical interview prep you need to worry about - coding, knowledge, problem solving skills (applying said knowledge) and method.

1. Coding - Choose a language and stick with it. Big N companies tend not to ask language specific questions. If you're a GT student, you're probably familiar with java from 1331 and 1332 so that's a safe bet. Some people say that Python is the best, but comfort with syntax beats number of words written every time, so go with what you know. You don't need to memorize all the standard libraries (ask your interviewer if you can make assumptions about what imports, etc. are allowed), but try to make the syntax as flawless as possible. Practice learning how to write while talking.

2. Knowledge - There's a bunch of stuff you should know, but try not to memorize anything - make sure you can understand it (once you do, you won't forget) and could code it on your own comfortably. More importantly, make sure you could code a variation of it if asked, and make sure you can use it as a tool to solve another problem. You should already have seen this stuff, but I'll put a (non comprehensive) list at the bottom.

3. Problem solving skills - these come with practice, but are not impossible to develop quickly, provided you're practicing the right way. It's less 1332 style memorization and more 3510 style algo design. Looking at coding interview problems and trying to figure out solutions (without spending the time to code each one out) really helps. Don't stare at something for more than 10 minutes if you're getting nowhere since that's a waste of time. If the best solution uses a data structure or algorithm you're unfamiliar with, then your knowledge is lacking, so look it up and understand how it works. The best way to develop these are to schedule mock interviews with friends, and also prep for these mock interviews as you would do for a normal interview, by revising concepts and looking at problems. IMO, mock interviews are the best way to develop these, since just having one scheduled motivates you to do some practice.

4. Method - this is the big one many people forget. You need to do mock interviews to be sure you're properly talking through your solutions, walking through test cases, analyzing time complexity correctly, etc. Doing your first mock interview with someone who knows what they're doing (or even someone who just picked a problem out of a book) can be pretty eye opening, so don't procrastinate on this. Don't forget all the behavioral stuff, and learn to stay calm.

My general advice would be to work through the concepts while peppering in mock interviews. Focus on understanding and getting the confidence to use these as tools to solve problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Source: I've gotten internship/full time offers from the big N companies I've applied to. They're not the hardest, and are basically the same recruiting wise as many other companies - people just get intimidated. They tend to have more randomness than other companies though, which really sucks if you get unlucky. I was president of the technical interview prep club for a few semesters, and also TAed for 3510 (that's where my algo prep recommendations come from). This is all based on stuff I've seen myself or heard of from students.

comment,"Forgot the topics list lol

If I were preparing for a technical interview, I would make sure I had a solid grasp of these topics, and would schedule mock interviews whenever I could, spending the time in between looking at new problems. Learning all of this stuff isn't necessary, but some stuff is more important than others, and you should prioritize stuff to cover in your non-interview prep time. Also remember that you shouldn't spend all of your time just studying for interviews since that's unhealthy and also makes you worse at understanding stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Stuff you should definitely know:

Linked lists

	\-circular, singly, doubly

	\-be able to manipulate them easily

	\-know common stuff like finding cycles, etc.

Recursion

	\-be comfortable with recursion on numbers, trees, and in some cases sublists/substring

	\-Fibonacci is a must to understand, but avoid the naive recursive solution at all costs

	\-Know common variations of and tricks using bnary search

Arrays

	\-Mostly used as inputs to problems

	\-Know how to approach the target-sum or similar problems (Google it) in linear time

	\-Understand in place vs out of place (for arrays and in general) and try to pick up some array manipulation tricks

Sorting

	\-Know how to sort shit

	\-know how to code efficient sorts

	\-Understand stability, in place vs. out of place

Stacks and queues

	\-Know how to implement, use them

	\-know stuff like parentheses mismatching, queue using 2 stacks, etc.

Trees

	\-binary trees

	\-binary search trees (always ask in an interview if the binary tree you're given is a search tree or not, in the case you can't infer from context)

	\-multiway trees

	\-be comfortable with traversals

	\-be comfortable with recursion on trees

Graphs

	\-DFS - very important. You should be able to traverse graphs, color them, find connected components, etc. You should be able to code DFS for multiple connected components, on different graph representations (not just nodes, but also adjacency matrices, cases where the nodes are elements ina  2d array, etc.) It's not hard to do this if you understand the core of the algorithm, but you'd be surprised how many graph questions boil down to one or two runs of DFS (I got DFS at Jane Street and Google)

	\-BFS - less clean and flexible than DFS in most cases, so DFS should be your go-to, unless you're trying to find shortest paths.

Hash tables

	\-know how to use them

	\-understand when to use a hash map vs. hash set

	\-know the API for it in your language of choice

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Stuff you should know (But definitely learn the earlier stuff first):

Heaps

	\-Binary heap implemented using an array is what interviewers will usually assume you're using

	\-So know how to code it, as well as manipulate it.

More hash table stuff

	\-learn how to code one - it's not that hard and helps you understand it better

	\-I was asked what a good hash function would be once, so having a sense of that is nice

More graph stuff:

	\-know Dijkstra's algorithm I guess? I've never seen it but seems like it could be useful

	\-know Kruskal's/Prim's algorithm - I've seen an MST once or twice, and these are some of the easier algorithms to code for dealing with MSTs

Bit manipulation

	\-know general 2110 bit manipulation stuff

	\-know the stupid missing number XOR trick

Tries

	\-Lead to very clean solutions for many problems

Dynamic programming

	\-Prioritize bottom up over top down - it's cleaner, often jsut as easy, and makes you seem more impressive

	\-Know solutions to some common problems

	\-Be able to reconstruct solutions (with auxiliary tables if necessary)

	\-Most DP problems you'll get are either 1 dimensional, 2 dimensional, or graph/tree based

	\-Nothing harder than what you might have seen in 3510

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

More obscure stuff that doesn't come up often, but can make you seem pretty impressive:

Self balancing BSTs

	\-I've gotten two questions about these - interviewers won't usually expect you to have memorized the exact definition of an AVL tree or a red-black tree, but knowing how to code rotations is helpful.

Disjoint set

	\-I've only used this a couple of times, but if you use a disjoint forest implementation it's dead simple to implement and leads to very clean/efficient solutions

	\-Learn what type of problems they help solve, and how to use them to solve those problems (know how to associate them with nodes using a map or an array)

	\-Maybe memorize time complexity (but not derivation lol) to mention and also so you have an idea of exactly how efficient they are

Even more hash table stuff

	\-understand a linked hash table - these can be very useful and in some cases help you get a time complexity faster than the interviewer expected.

	\-know the nuances of time complexity - it's not tricky and simply mentioning that O(1) is average case and not guaranteed impresses many interviewers. (mentioning advantages of using comparable data also helps)

String searching

	\-I mentioned KMP in an interview once, but Karp-Rabin is probably the only one you'd feasibly be asked to implement, since it's the easiest to come up with on your own.

FFT

	\-I was asked to multiply large integers once and decided to use FFT. The intrviewer said the full implementation would likely be overkill for an interview, so we went with Karatsuba's divide and conquer algorithm instead (she was prepared to walk me through some of that one since she didn't assume prior knowledge of Karatsuba's algorithm)

	\-Don't bother learning this - this is more of an example of weird stuff that could come up in an interview, and how it shouldn't intimidate you

If it just stays in one spot then there's no better option than a regular old PC. Modern ones can emulate PS3 and such but for most retro consoles any PC should be fine.

If it's portable, then there's many options:

Gpd win 2:

* basically a handheld PC, the best choice if money's no object.

* expensive

PSP:

* cheap, &lt;$40

* struggles with some consoles SNES/Sega CD/N64

Smartphone:

* depending on how new yours is they can emulate most retro consoles

* touch screen controls are awful in my opinion

GPD XD:

* excellent hardware for emulation

* a lower spec android

* supports many emulators

MintyPi v3(mentioned already)

* from my understanding they are underpowered, but the new ones mightbe able to handle most games. May struggle above N64/PS1

3DS and PSvita are also options but I don't know to much about them.

CS majors end up doing the core concepts of that class in CS2110, and I still thought it was interesting for the most part. 1331 is a good class to see how you feel about coding imo. I would just take 2551 if you are still pretty undecided since it counts for both majors (i had lubinsky and he wasnt too bad).  Personally, id look to get involved in one CS activity and one ECE activity outside of class to decide what you like if you have the time. I realized that I had interest in doing personal projects in CS outside of class, but very little motivation to learn/use ECE concepts on my own time.

3) a huge part of academic evaluation is based on gpa and there can be a scenario for discrimination based off of whoever has that excel sheet.

great cS offering if you want a job but food service is probably one of the jobs with least down time/job satisfaction there is. You have to remember other departments are more forgiving with rigor of work on the job because they know you‚Äôre a student.

comment,"This school has great faculty, great students, and a great police department. But literally every other service has absolutely failed to even meet the minimum of minimum of standards and needs some serious reorg. If only this could impact school ranking because that is really all the management cares about.

We can start improving by actually dishing out consequences for severe breaches such as this. It is almost as if we have the smartest minds and professors but can't afford to hire people who can cook, provide decent housing renovations and services, or keep Taco Bell. And then the entire undergraduate body gets their GTIDs leaked because someone didn't care enough to double check. What gives?

I hate to be an asshole but when negligent things like this happen I can't help but wonder why I feel conflicted about being a proud Tech graduate. I hate this management but I loved the learning experience.

Please fucking do something this time GT.

1.5) Obligatory ""fuck PTS"" remark.

2.) Housing has often left buildings lacking very important features for long lengths of time.   Remember a few years back when NorthAve East had numerous false fire alarms per semester solely due to equipment failure and didn't have any working elevators for a 13-floor housing building on many days?

3.) Holy hell there seems to be a complete lack of regard for basic cyber security practices.  Evidenced by these ridiculous data leaks.

1. Was the email sent by a staff member of the Institute Diversity, Equity and Inclusion? It wasn't real clear from the email. 
2. Not sure how much experience others in this thread have in business settings, but mishandling of sensitive data happens a lot out there. I'm not saying leaks happen a lot, but mishandling happens a lot. A lot of companies have likely done better over the last few years at having compliance teams to help with this, but I imagine this is not a large percentage. Almost every office is going to have someone that has emails, Excel files, etc. that contain sensitive data. Nowadays, there's probably not as much SSN and CC# out there in those formats, but I'm sure there's tons of DOBs, address, phone numbers, GPAs, salary info, etc. All it takes is one simple mistake to attach the wrong file, not think to remove certain info from a file, or send an email to the wrong people.

Rent can be as low as about $550 per month (though that won‚Äôt include utilities so I‚Äôd expect minimally $650-$700 per month). Tech square area is typically nicer than on campus or home park but will also be more expensive than on campus. Any of those places you would have your own bedroom.

Living anywhere in a studio/ one bedroom is going to be a lot more expensive than living with other people. However, you can easily end up with really bad roommates if you don‚Äôt have people you know to live with, and if you‚Äôre living off campus there‚Äôs really nothing you can do about it.

Official policy in our department for those teaching is that there should be hard copies of student grades kept on file. It is not clear how closely this is followed (even in our department). Combine this type of policy with accounting offices and their data, (who may or may not have similar policies) and it is not hard to see why it might be insisted that records are not too hard to access/distribute. By making it easier to print, access, and make copies, one has lax security which can be expected to lead to these types of leaks.

The reasons for insisting that there be hard copies seems to be based on a view associated with digital data that it is easily tampered/lost. The people who are most informed about the reality of these risks are sometimes not the people who make decisions on policy, and so it may not be very appropriate to blame the technicians or expect that the actual technical implementations are the problem; they have to follow protocol.

It would be interesting to get the perspective from employees and staff (in accounting areas) on how the actual data is managed. But a guess is that the details are not pretty.",Negative,"data security, ferpa violation",6,2019-11-07

On democratic reform: completely agree those are all issues that need to be dealt with, but keep in mind, the largest voting bloc in the US are people who don't vote. The best way to start to get things done is to advocate for ideas the masses want instead of the corporate interests that Washington has become beholden to. Pete, however, welcomes and seeks out big dollar donors which leads to many questions -- for example, how can I trust that someone's health care plan is in the best interest of all Americans if the health care industry in its current form is helping fund their campaign?

On foreign policy: Pete is by no means committed to ending the wars we've waged around the world. This is a vastly important issue to me as well, but he's even said he would keep troops in Afghanistan, a country we have been stationed in for nearly 20 years without reason. Also, it's almost definitely a stretch to call him an 'expert' in foreign policy.

Lastly on the unity paragraph: Sure I will grant you that he *sounds* like a voice of unity, but once you get past the surface level, what does that even mean?

comment,"agree to disagree ig. I know Pete isn‚Äôt the most popular candidate at gt, esp on reddit. I‚Äôm pretty solid in my support and just wanted to find some other supporters.

also, to add counterpoints: 

Pete isn‚Äôt funded by the healthcare industry. He‚Äôs refused to accept corporate pac money. Simply bc a lot of his donors work in the healthcare industry (as nurses, technicians, doctors etc) does not mean the industry is funding him. They are just regular working people. I think it‚Äôs a good sign that people who work in healthcare support him and his plan. His average donation per donor was around $30 for q3. 

Pete is definitely committed to end wars. He‚Äôs proposed an automatic 3 yr sunset on every authorization of military force. He‚Äôs stated he‚Äôs committed to withdrawing all troops from Afghanistan by the end of his first year in office and only have counter terrorism operations in the Middle East.

From the polls, it‚Äôs evidenced that Pete appeals to a broad audience, from liberals to conservatives. Being from the midwest himself, Pete understands a lot of the pain and problems the people there are facing and in fact had to work firsthand to solve them as a mayor in South Bend. I‚Äôm also from the midwest and there is a big difference between South Bend and many other industrial age cities, due to Pete‚Äôs revitalization efforts.",Neutral,"politics, healthcare, foreign policy, campaign funding, midwest, pete buttigieg",2,2019-11-07

For u/kuangdrew : SPI is an interface where you connect the SCLK, MOSI, and MISO lines together to every device, and then select which device you're talking to using the chip select line. In your case, you'd need 3 pins from the mega to act as SCLK, MOSI, and MISO (and there are probably hardware SPI pins already assigned), and 3 pins, one for each sensor, to act as chip select. You'll have to read the datasheet to see if they're active high or active low, which will tell you whether to write a digital high or a digital low to activate each chip.

Hurley v. Irish American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557 (1995), is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States regarding free speech rights, specifically the rights of groups to determine what message their activities convey to the public. The Court ruled that private organizations, even if they were planning on and had permits for a public demonstration, were permitted to exclude groups if those groups presented a message contrary to the one the organizing group wanted to convey. Addressing the specific issues of the case, the Court found that private citizens organizing a public demonstration may not be compelled by the state to include groups who impart a message the organizers do not want to be presented by their demonstration, even if the intent of the state was to prevent discrimination.

You realize Trump is the moderate, almost left-leaning Republican, and the people breaking with him are the Neocons?  Jacob Chambers describes himself as a Rubio/Ryan conservative.  These are the types of politicians who:

* Believe life begins at conception so all abortion should be banned, including in cases of rape or incest.
* Believe it is the responsibility of the US military to stabilize the rest of the world, overthrowing regimes and propping up others.  The types that were cheering on the Iraq war as a way of nation building and want the US to get actively in the middle of civil wars in Syria and Turkey.
* Want gay marriage to be returned to being illegal because of their religious beliefs.
* Want to eliminate social safety programs entirely, if possible.
* Believe in free trade at all costs, including the extreme deflation of wages and increasing unemployment

Trump isn't perfect, but on all of these issues he's very much the least traditionally conservative Republican we've had in modern history:

* Clearly doesn't care about the abortion issue but says what he needs to to not have the pro-life people go crazy.  Probably just wants to keep the status quo, with banning late-term abortions but never banning entirely.
* Clearly on the withdraw side of removing the US from foreign conflicts.  He was willing to take out ISIS, but come on, those people were modern-day Nazis and directly threatening the western world.  The Turk/Kurd/Assad/FSA conflicts he's tried to stay far out of, except to punish war crimes with the use of chemical weapons.  Again, there's room for criticism, but Trump is the least hawkish of the Republicans.
* Largely embraces gay people.  Sure, Pence doesn't have the same track record, but Trump is holding rainbow pride flags on stage.  You won't see Ryan or Rubio do that.
* Hasn't tried to significantly squash safety net programs.
* Wants to renegotiate trade agreements so that US workers are paid more and have more jobs available.

Trump's biggest campaign promise is reducing illegal immigration, which is endorsed wholesale by every administration before him going back to Reagan.  The only difference between him and them is that he actually takes it seriously and is trying, harder than any of them, to get it done.

Illegal immigration and free trade with countries with exploit their citizens are the two biggest things impacting wealth inequality.  People can't demand better pay because companies will move abroad or hire workers under the table.  The only reason these jobs aren't ones ""Americans want to do"" are because they pay so little with poor working conditions.

the organization clearly attracts people who take a little too much pleasure in the job - [a facebook group for ICE agents had to be removed for the way they were talking about immigrants and anti ICE politicians](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/customs-and-border-protection-investigating-secret-facebook-page-where-agents-allegedly-mock-migrant-deaths/), and that group had 9500 members, which iirc is like half the total number of ICE agents. not to mention the countless cases of people visiting their border camps and saying they're essentially torture.

If you aren't aware of history, that's on you, not me. 

it's funny how you appear to care about freedom but are ignorant to how class stratification in America limits your freedom. The truth is, if you are living paycheck to paycheck trying to feed your family, you aren't free. You don't have the same opportunities as everyone else. You can't go to school and you can't pay medical bills, not of any fault of own, but that you are poor. You are just trying to live under a system that really doesn't give a fuck about you. But then again, the people who don't want the status quo to change are often the same people who directly benefit/aren't hurt by the current one. So I don't blame you for not wanting systemic change. But if all life is about oneself and one's own particular set of beliefs, never challenging one's own opinion and being uncaring to the plight of others, that's a sad world that I don't want to be in.

Protests in Hong Kong are about fighting against an oppressive system of control. So on that point, I agree with you. I wish we were less complacent than we are. The same ideas of limiting speech (ex. Withholding federal funds from clinics that talk about abortion as an option) exists in our country too. We are just okay with it because our lives go unaffected, until you find yourself on the other end the sword. what's important here isn't ""socialism vs capitalism"", what's important here is fixing the problems we live with, and I believe more socialist policies would lead to a better America.

Even a broken clock is correct twice a day and I have my doubts as to whether Jacob's (or those who still remain loyal to an ideaology which is more concerned with preserving station, privilege and power than responsible governance) moral compass will serve him any better in the future than it has thus far.

No, it's what-aboutism.  Your argument is ""well, we can't fix jobs lost to automation so it's pointless to try and tackle anything else"".

I'm not against immigration or global trade, I'm very much in favor of both.  But they need to be controlled and we absolutely have the means to do it.  This isn't a new issue, people were very much unhappy with European immigrants in the early 1900s, labor unions most of all.

The Immigration Act of 1924, or Johnson‚ÄìReed Act, including the Asian Exclusion Act and National Origins Act (Pub.L. 68‚Äì139, 43 Stat. 153, enacted May 26, 1924), was a United States federal law that prevented immigration from Asia, set quotas on the number of immigrants from the Eastern Hemisphere, and provided funding and an enforcement mechanism to carry out the longstanding ban on other immigrants.

The 1924 act supplanted earlier acts to effectively ban all immigration from Asia and set a total immigration quota of 165,000 for countries outside the Western Hemisphere, an 80% reduction from the pre-World War I average. Quotas for specific countries were based on 2% of the U.S. population from that country as recorded in 1890.

comment,"&gt;However, immigrants should not be blamed solely for jobs going away.

It's extremely hard to blame immigrants for wanting to move to the best country on the face of the planet.  How could I blame them, especially when there are lots of people here doing everything in their power to make them feel welcome.

No, I blame the left for actively supporting open borders.  I blame them, especially the rich and middle class democrats, for actively encouraging them to move to the US so that they can feel better about themselves.  Either they don't care or won't listen if it makes things harder for lower class rural and suburban Americans.

Many of them are contemptuous of Trump-voting peoples without a college degree.  It is painfully clear that they show more compassion and humanity to illegal immigrants from foreign countries than white Americans who live in poor trailer parks.  They don't care about the disharmony it creates in the lower rungs of society because they don't have to live near it, and quite frankly, they benefit greatly from the cheap labor.

comment,"Unfortunately none of you will be able to take a class from this prof since I believe he was the victim of a change in leadership at GT, but Dr. Pradeep Agrawal (ChBE) was my favorite professor during my tenure at Tech. 

He was the head of ChBE undergrads and took it upon himself to stop teaching Junior/Senior courses and teach the first ChBE class. My goodness was that class a beast and was he relentless. However, he was an incredible teacher who held hw sessions every Friday in addition to regular office hours. He made sure that anyone paying attention would understand the fundamentals of ChBE when they left his class, something that you used in literally every class, no exception. To me the fact that he was obviously very busy as head of undergrad ChBE but still took all that time for us really spoke to his character. His tests spoke to his sadism (jk that‚Äôs just Tech). 

It didn‚Äôt end there though, every semester I met with him, since I formed a personal relationship with Dr. Agrawal, to adjust my schedule and make sure that I stayed on course to graduate in 4 years, kept my grades up, and talk about what I wanted from the program. 

Dr. Agrawal nominated me to the Student Advisory Board for ChBE, gave me the opportunity to be a student that met with the Executive Advisory Board of ChBE, and informed me of all available scholarships for the programs around (which were few and far between). 

I credit whatever understanding I have left of ChBE to him (I ended up doing a less traditional job out of school and am now pursuing an MBA). Overall my relationship with him is what guided me through ChBE and helped me figure out what I wanted to do in life. It‚Äôs truly a shame he left Tech. 

A close second would be the prof I researched for during my Sophomore and Junior years (total of 5 semesters). I‚Äôll keep the name anonymous since his group was small and would probably reveal me, but basically I had the scientific method pounded into me along with critical thinking and an understanding of how to collaborate with a diverse group of talent. All of those are incredibly important skill irl. 

Basically what this comes down to if you want a prof to make a real impression on your life is MAKE RELATIONSHIPS. It‚Äôs trite, but also true and I‚Äôd encourage everyone to try it. Remember that they are busy and may not be open the first tine you approach them, however, nothing worth having is easy to obtain.

And I've got undergrad research on top of this. Is this doable? I'm thinking of dropping CS 2340 but it might be useful stuff to know early. Otherwise I could drop ENGL 1102, though I do want to get that done ASAP.","Neutral

comment,"Martina Balic, she was the instructor for my graphics and dynamics classes last year. I didn‚Äôt visit her office hours much in graphics, because I usually didn‚Äôt need help with the software used in class. Dynamics was completely different. I would visit her office once a week to discuss homework and concepts in class, and I slowly realized that she is one of the most endearing faculty members in the CEE program. My friend and I would often find ourselves in her office hours just talking about life and how we would spend our free-time. It always makes me sad when people assume that she‚Äôs not a good instructor for dynamics due to her low GPA in.

comment,"Sorry, but gas chambers and ethnic cleansing are *not* necessary requirements for a concentration camp. I really don't understand why people act as if that's some sort of gotcha - it's not. You don't need to be literal Nazi Germany to have concentration camps, and it doesn't detract from the horror of the Holocaust to say that these migrant detention centers are concentration camps. We have the capacity for nuance. The way those children were/are treated is/was wrong. Full stop. We don't need to argue about this.

I agree on China. The Chinese people are wonderful, but fuck the Chinese government and any person or corporation too scared to speak out for what's right. The Uighurs and the Hong Kongers deserve to be heard, even if it's a little inconvenient for our wallets.

I also agree that the immigration problem is complicated and complex and I definitely don't pretend to have all the answers. But you better believe if I were in charge those kids would have fucking soap and blankets. And I wouldn't try to make myself feel better about it by pointing at the other guy who couldn't quite figure it out either. That shit is weak, we're better than that.

I think I'd start by decriminalizing and regulating most drugs (let's go ahead and free and forgive all of our non-violent drug offenders while we're at it). No more income for the cartels. If they want to make money, they must become legitimate businesses and stop murdering people in the streets. Bring the worst offenders to justice of course, but give the rest a path to real, honest jobs. Give them something to lose.

Cut off the (American) drug money and I bet the Mexican and other Latin and South American governments would be able to get the cartels under control. And I bet without cartels, people wouldn't feel the need to risk their lives crossing the fucking Sonoran desert to ""take American jobs"". 

I live out here, it's fucking brutal, even during the more forgiving times of year, I can't imagine what dire straights I'd need to be in for such a journey to be the logical path forward. And I bet once people don't feel threatened in their own homes, if you give them a chance to breath and collect themselves, I have a hard time believing they'd feel the need to make that journey, that sacrifice. And, by the way, isn't it funny how the farther you get from the boarder, the louder people seem to get about illegal immigration? It's almost like they have no fucking clue whatsoever and are just looking for a boogeyman and a talking point.

And if I *really* wanted to crack down, I'd go after all the people *hiring* the migrants, not the migrants themselves. They're the real victims here. They just want a chance to earn a slice of the American lifestyle. Nothing wrong with that. If you were in their shoes, wouldn't you? The (obvious) problem here is, once we actually crack down, we quickly realize why migrant labor is a *good* thing, legal or otherwise (maybe this is a good opportunity to re-think what it means to be an illegal immigrant?). Good luck affording an American to do back-breaking labor like that, and with no migrant labor, say goodbye to a massive chunk of our agricultural output. *We* need these people just as much as they need us, and we should respect them and treat them right.

The other thing I'd do is stop fucking around in their politics. It's *their* government, not ours, we have no right to interfere. If we want to spread the American way of life, *show* them why they should want to be American. Actions speak louder than words. Give aid to the *people*, not the crooks at the top. Air drop that shit in there. Make them like us. I dunno, throw some Kanye in an aid package, use that big ass military we keep wasting our tax revenue on to deliver it. How do you get more American than that?

All of this would take time of course. But if we'd stop yelling at each other about the scary brown people coming to take our jobs (it's their land, by the way, the Mexicans lived down here way before we ever did; also, what about those caravans we were so concerned about around election time last year?), and stop acting like the victim when we're actually the problem, and start working to address *root cause*, I bet we could make real progress within a few years, and solve the problem within a decade or two.

I dunno, man. I'm an engineer, not a political scientist. We can do better than this, though. Start with the fucking basics...","Negative

comment,"I am sad to say no professor at Tech had an impact on my life outside of tech, but there were professors who I learned a lot from and who I still remember fondly, because they actually made an effort to teach. (This was not my experience with the vast majority of professors, so it either speaks highly of these few professors, or really badly about Tech as a whole ).

The professor I remember most fondly was Stephen Ruffin in AE. I was a regular at his office hours, and even though I didn‚Äôt ace the classes I took with him (I‚Äôm pretty average by Tech standards) I learned more than I did in some other classes which I did ace. I asked a lot of dumb questions and he never made me feel stupid, just made me walk myself through the solution by asking me questions. The only other professor I had a similar experience with was Seitzman (also AE); his lectures weren‚Äôt always great but in office hours he always made me realize it was a good idea to have stopped by.

I‚Äôve also had professors who gave me smart ass answers when I asked a question they considered dumb, or ones that made it clear they were not really interested in teaching, and a decade later I am still resentful of them.",Negative,"impact, professors, teaching, memories",6,2019-11-11

comment,"A concentration camp is: ‚Äú Concentration camp, internment centre for political prisoners and members of national or minority groups who are confined for reasons of state security, exploitation, or punishment, usually by executive decree or military order. Persons are placed in such camps often on the basis of identification with a particular ethnic or political group rather than as individuals and without benefit either of indictment or fair trial. Concentration camps are to be distinguished from prisons interning persons lawfully convicted of civil crimes and from prisoner-of-war camps in which captured military personnel are held under the laws of war. They are also to be distinguished from refugee camps or detention and relocation centres for the temporary accommodation of large numbers of displaced persons.‚Äù

By definition ICE isn‚Äôt running a concentration camp. The immigrants are getting a fair trail and are being held lawfully due to breaking a law that‚Äôs not based on ethnicity or political group.

China is running concentration camps for the Uighers. Literally raping, dismembering, organ harvesting, and lab testing them against their will. All due to their political and religious beliefs. 

We are not treating those in the care of ice within even 1/10th the cruelty of China or Nazi German.

As for cartels. You know they do much more than just drugs. They also do human trafficking and mob style ‚Äúprotection‚Äù stichks. Even if drugs are decriminalized they‚Äôd still be selling them. California and Colorado still have huge black markets for weed. 

As for our foreign policy. The us uses is strength to change international policy in our favor. We tried isolationism once and it ended in ww2.

comment,"Back in 07-08, I was an undecided RAT, and Dr. Derek Tittle taught my intro to microeconomics course. He made it fun and interesting enough that I decided I wanted to study economics as my major. Later, he also took over as academic adviser for the School of Economics, and sorry to say, the previous adviser was clueless, so he had a great impact when he took over and actually helped me pursue a math minor, when before I was planning on taking very little math (whoever let us think that advanced math wasn't important for upper level economics was horribly misguided). So he definitely had a huge positive impact on my academic career.

But overall, I'd have to say the professor with the biggest impact on my life was easily Dr. Jerry Ulrich, the choral professor.

comment,"Assuming the dean's office(s) had access to all of the information.... I see this entire episode as the Institute playing defense via offense.    Given that a GT faculty/staff member basically crashed and disrupted YDSA's event (according to reporting on this issue)... that leaves GT administration in an odd spot.  Few public colleges want to acquire a reputation as a place where their employees  go out of their way to actively inhibit or bully students.

By penalizing the student organization, they put YDSA on the defensive to focus their energies on protecting their autonomy (and forestalling more censure) rather than drawing attention to the event in a way that would embarrass the faculty member and prompt questions of her department/supervisors from GT administration.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how YDSA is structured, but i'm guessing that its helmed by students who have other fish to fry besides starting the process of lobbying the dean and GT administration to investigate the faculty member's behavior.  This way, YDSA gets to feel like they are vindicated by dodging a bullet, and GT is free to quietly suggest that the faculty member exercise more discretion in the future.   

&amp;#x200B;

That being said,  several people in my dorm when I was at Tech  would have gladly have spent hours a week making as large a bureaucratic mess for this faculty member as humanly possible by constantly drawing attention to it and reminding people what had happened.",Negative,"institute, gt faculty, ydsa event, gt administration, student organization, faculty member, behavior, dorm.",2,2019-11-11

The reasoning that the other poster didn‚Äôt mention is because of how the old HVAC systems work. Particularly buildings that use boilers.

He was an AE professor here back when I was an undergrad; he's now the director of JPL Planetary Exploration Program. He researched how to land spacecraft at Mars.

It was Spring semester Junior year. I had been planning on taking the summer off to deal with some depression (I had taken classes the other summers). But before I left for the summer I wanted to line up some undergrad research for the next year. I read through all of the profiles of the professors on the AE website to see what their research was. His was the most interesting and I had done something somewhat similar at a former internship, so I sent him an email asking if I could work in his lab in the Fall.

I got a response that said essentially ""Victor, you seem like you'd be a great addition to the lab. However, I need someone who can do an internship at NASA Ames this summer. Are you available?""

That was it. There was no interview with NASA; he just essentially gave me an internship at NASA after an email and a phone conversation. That internship looked good when I applied to SpaceX the next summer. And through him I met my graduate school adviser where I did similar work. I currently work in the field of atmospheric entry.

But through the whole debate, I kept thinking that there is actually a huge source of quiet areas to study on campus: EMPTY CLASSROOMS, it is just that they are sometimes locked, or you never know if there is class about to show up.

And the same goes for collaboration work: EMPTY CLASSROOMS

There's some other small things about the class that I really enjoy, but what I really enjoy is how he is able to make something I never considered remotely interesting (circuits and computer thingies) so enjoyable. Also, he's so encouraging with accepting any and all questions during class. He's told us on many occasions that he just wants everyone in the room to understand what's going on and to stop him if we have any questions.

comment,"Can't speak for GT. But like I said, nothing should be taken away from the efforts of second place and beyond teams. In fact, if I'm recalling correctly, the gap between top 3 or 4 and the rest was far larger than the gap between 1 &amp; 2.

The trikes are designed for kids. Getting them to where they can support college students for a 4 mile race, while also staying within the rules is not trivial. Not to mention pushing the damn things is surprisingly hard. Finishing at all is commendable.

Then there's the teams that go above and beyond. That's those top 4 or so. Not only do they finish, they're not limping the last lap by any stretch. They've considered not just how to make a trike that survives, but a trike that goes fast. And they're always noticeably on a different level.

And lastly there's the team that's won the past two years. This is literally their thing. They don't do any other homecoming events. I hear they hold tryouts for who gets to actually race. They probably spent a pretty penny on getting that trike to work like it does. They're definitely deserving of the praise from the Institute for their effort (with the caveat that any times reported should be factual).

All that to say, don't feel bad because you got second place. Or third or dead last. Getting a trike across the finish line at all is a minority accomplishment and a helluva effort.",Positive,college homecoming event,3,2019-11-12

It seems very suspicious that they would be using this type of data for targeting students for a ""lunch and learn event with one of our corporate partners who provide internships/coops/employment opportunities to our students"". I wonder if someone could make a case for discrimination, specifically with regards to ethnicity.

On the other hand, if they weren't using those attributes then there was no reason for them to have a file with those attributes. That is indicative of a systemic problem! FERPA information should all be behind a tightly controlled interface and not just sitting around on spreadsheets. Then, if you need a list of names and emails, you can run a query that only returns names and emails. If you need a list of names and emails of students above some GPA threshold, then you can run such a query without returning the individual GPAs. Some people will have a legitimate need to run more in-depth queries but there should be clear warnings against running queries for more data than is required.

comment,"Yeah, I'm not a lawyer and I don't claim to be one. I just see this as a way for them to try to get out of any lawsuit. Additionally, the waiver of immunity is only to tort claims, which require that one suffered a loss, which is defined in 50-21-22(3) as:

&gt; ""Loss"" means personal injury; disease; death; damage to tangible property, including lost wages and economic loss to the person who suffered the injury, disease, or death; pain and suffering; mental anguish; and any other element of actual damages recoverable in actions for negligence.

I think it would be hard to equate the loss any student suffered with the value of free tuition. As a settlement, maybe? But only if the State (a) determines it is liable (and remember it's the State that gets to decide if the State is liable) and (b) determines that the value of the settlement would be less than litigation.",Negative,legal,4,2019-11-12

Being the department head, he has the duty to exercise care in sending communications, and he failed in that dramatically.

So, meet a lot of people. My freshman dorm had almost no one pledge, and we all just hung out all the time, and we met a lot of people through proximity.

comment,"I think it depends on the department. Some departments will give nothing, some will give a partial waiver, and others will give a complete waiver and even a stipend. Generally the engineering and computer science departments do the latter, since they have money to do this, and your research also brings in actual money (so they're still getting a great deal by waiving your tuition), whereas departments which generate less money (such as business and architecture) do the former because they don't have much to give and the research probably doesn't translate to profit. At least that is how it was a few years ago when I was a student. 

If I were you, I would speak to your academic adviser or someone in your department about RA salaries because it really depends on the department. 

Also note that the payment process may not be automatic; in my case the AE department used provide documentation for me to give to the bursar office indicating that tuition is to be waived and I would have to physically deliver that to the bursar at the start of the semester. After that when I'd log into oscar (or whatever software you guys use today) to make the payment, the tuition would be zero. The stipend on the other hand used to be direct deposit to bank account if I remember correctly.

If you are doing an MS, and your dept waives tuition for RA's, definitely do it.

comment,"Here it is in 7 easy steps:

1. Don‚Äôt be involved in greek life

2. Meet people. Say hi to classmates. Go to a club meeting. Nerd out with someone over how Fallout 76 is the best game ever made. Accidentally crash your unicycle after getting plastered and trying to catch a donut that you dropped while riding, and be conversational with the people who poke you with a stick to see if you‚Äôre dead. To each their own, and do whatever way you want, but you gotta meet at least a good group of people you‚Äôll stick with.

3. Grow your relationships with the people that you‚Äôve meet and especially the ones you like. Keep talking to them in class and maybe hangout, or study in the culc. Keep going to that club meeting and go to that dinner/hangout that you‚Äôre instigating if nobody else in the club does. Dunk multiplayer in the greatest game of all time with your new buddy. Teach the stick people how to ride unicycles (being sober recommended but not necessary). 

4. Of the people you now have in your life, see if [potential romantic interest] is interested in having a better relationship with you. If it doesn‚Äôt work out, no big deal, there are a lot of fish in the sea. Keep going. 

5. Relationship is developed enough? Alright, get over that massive, crushing anxiety that makes you want to die and ask [romantic interest] if they‚Äôd like to pursue something more with you. 

6. They said yes? Congrats! They aren‚Äôt sure? Ok, give them time since people need different things to get into relationships, but don‚Äôt expect a yes. Got rejected? Ok, you tried and hopefully had fun and learned a bit along the way. Keep going.

7. Keep living life my dude, and don‚Äôt give up hope, whether you‚Äôre teaming up or soloing some sweet sweet Fallout 76. Or unicycling. Or both, I‚Äôm not your [parental guardian figure]. And remember to enjoy the ride

The biggest thing for me and for many people was getting over 5. It is hard to ask someone out sometimes. You can also try a more casual dating experience where you try to develop a relationship with someone through dates, but don‚Äôt be vague with what kind of relationship you want

Also lemme tell you dating does not require finesse lol. Idk what you‚Äôre not doing but the lack of a girlfriend doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre doing it wrong. Unless you‚Äôre being an obsessive creep. That is wrong. In case you have trouble telling where that line is, it‚Äôs roughly around where you cross into their personal space (like physically getting super close to them or being very suggestive) more than once when they‚Äôre not open to it. So don‚Äôt be a creep but be willing to not just be a wallflower. Good luck",Positive,"socializing, relationships, dating, advice.",16,2019-11-13

comment,"It does a couple of things. First, in instances like the unintentional sharing of academic data from last week, OIT can go in and directly remove the data from the mail server, ideally before anyone actually sees it. However, if it is automatically forwarded, then that data is saved on some other server that the administration can't access. 

From a more traditional cybersecurity perspective, it brings the responsibility of actual security more in-house. GT can implement all kinds of security measures, but if the GMail account you're forwarding to gets compromised, then it doesn't really matter.  This is especially important for employees, since they frequently are dealing with other students'/faculty's sensitive data as well as their own.

So it does help somewhat, and I doubt this is the only step they're taking, but it is definitely annoying and inconvenient for people who rely on the forwarding features.",Neutral,"data security, cybersecurity, data privacy, employee productivity",22,2019-11-14

GT actually has two ensembles that strings can play in (both of which are full orchestras:) GT Chamber Orchestra and GT Symphony Orchestra  (typically called GTSO.) They are both audition ensembles, and auditions are held at the beginning of each semester, (although, second semester auditions are kinda hit or miss, because available spots depend on how many people stay enrolled in the ensembles.) Every audition, whether Chamber or GTSO, will consist of a major and minor scale, 3 octaves each, of your choice. Each audition will also have excerpts that you will be required to read (Chamber and GTSO have different sets of excerpts.) 
gtband.net has the audition excerpts from Fall19 auditions still up and available, so I would take a look at those and assess your skill level based on what you can realistically play. Both ensembles play professional, unarranged literature :)
As far as how difficult it is to get into the ensembles, I can‚Äôt say with any certainty. GTSO is definitely the more difficult ensemble, but once you are accepted into an ensemble, you are automatically eligible for it in following semesters, no reauditioning required! The only time you would have to audition again is if you wanted to try out for a higher ensemble.

Nobody likes carefully navigating a bike out by hand daily unless you own a shop.

Your 14 years of experience is useless out of context. My reasoning makes sense, you just don't want to listen. Your data set is fairly useless as it's one data set, for one specific person, over a long period. You haven't met every rider in the city, and you surround yourself with people like you. Which is why you see all of these things that fit your viewpoint. Most people get motorcycles because they like riding, not to impress women.

&gt;If every state were to decrease out of state enrollment, there would be tens of thousands of talented students stuck in their big state college with few opportunities.

That's not really Tech's problem to fix. I can understand providing the opportunity to students who don't have it, but people are talking like Tech doesn't already admit a ton of OOS students. And the majority of those students are not from areas where there'a a lack of opportunity. Tech hovers at around 40% OOS. Out of the top 25 public colleges (USNews), only **8** have OOS percentages above 30%. Most public colleges don't enroll as many OOS students as Tech.

&gt;Private schools would continue to enroll based mostly on merit and little on residency, where public schools would be the opposite.

Not necessarily. Top public colleges are pretty damn hard to get into these days, just like private colleges. Even at Tech, it gets more competitive for in-state students each year. Is it as hard as OOS? I doubt it, but it's a public college. Enrolling students from your state doesn't mean they're skimping on ""merit"".

&gt;Georgia Tech, based in a state with little over 10 million people, would continue to have to compete with powerhouse private schools that pull interest and money from the entire nation

This hasn't stopped UNC, UCLA, UT Austin, UVA, UC Berkeley, UIUC, etc. from competing and all of those schools enroll fewer OOS students. Heck, it's *well known* that UNC has a hard quota on OOS students. UC Berkeley is usually &lt; 20% OOS, and they're every bit as strong as Tech in every field.

&gt;Our main priority shouldn't be staying true to the state, instead we need to be more focused on becoming the best school possible and serving the best students, all which benefit Georgia.

How do we do this within the context of being a public university and answering to the USG and taxpayers? Short of going private, there's no way around those two things. You're talking like staying true to the state and ""serving the best students"" are mutually exclusive.

I'm well aware of that. Still doesn't make it any less of a positive change in your life. Be happy about the little things. When you finish a workout, tell yourself how awesome you are.

Gee, who the fuck am I to act like I know how to deal with Clinical Depression? It isn't like I have firsthand experience in overcoming it, or anything. Except that I do, and you are making a ridiculous amount of assumptions about me that have absolutely no basis in anything I've said.

&gt;you might actually do harm by telling this to people in real life

**Show me where I said that positive thinking should be the only approach to treating Depression. Show me exactly where I said it, and where you didn't just make an assumption out of thin air**. Everyone is different, and talk therapy is usually the best way to go; learning to reframe your mental-image is generally a huge part of that. So you can buzz off with telling me I can't help people by sharing my tips. 

I'm trying to share a little positive energy in a subreddit full of negativity and complaining, and here you are, whining about how I didn't specifically describe how to handle Clinical Depression. If you want to help people, help people. If you just want to armchair-quarterback folks who are trying to spread some kindness because it doesn't do **everything** you think it should, shut up and screw off, because you aren't helping anyone.

&gt;True but completely irrelevant in this context.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hence why I said true.   
&gt;  
&gt;Let's be clear. I 100% agree that practicing gratitude is one of the most positive, life-changing things you can do for your mental wellbeing.

What I was hoping you'd find is that **how to actually help an individual**, is different from **what you should say to that individual**.

I really hope none of your depressed friends talk to you about it. It's a lot harder to listen without judgement than to offer advice. I definitely struggle with it, especially true given how this conversation turned out. And you're the one who brought up your own anecdotal evidence of firsthand depression, that's the only reason I mentioned mine.

Hi! Thank you for your comment. I understand that this is not an ideal situation, but this is also not a serious research where I have to present data in black and white. I wasn't clear enough in my post.   


I don't need to extract the numbers. This is only something I want to check. I am only interested in seeing ""the interest"" and merely mention it in the presentation. We're presenting sketches, but as I am majoring in Interaction Design, I'd love to be able to back up my emotional and durable design with a quote as ""a majority would bring a bottle if they could"".   


I can see the up/down votes, and I think that should be enough. But, of course, I'll have to look into the ""adds random noise to the score""... If it's total horse shit I will make an anonymous survey.

comment,"So biggest thing to know about therapy is that for most people (though there are exceptions) it takes time to work. Just like in physical therapy, your brain doesn't get strong again in just one day. That's part of why we usually recommend to get started early rather than delaying until it's terrible.

Part of what that means is that it's better to do something in whatever area you're going to be in long-term. If you're coming back to Tech after break, you definitely want something in this area. Going to one appointment back home and then never seeing that therapist again likely will not help. The Counseling Center can maybe help you find a therapist, but they don't do therapy, just one-offs (which is part of why they're so useless).

Now, for me, therapy can actually be anything from exhausting to relaxing, depending on the stage of life and the day. What happens depends drastically - there are lots of different methods used by different practitioners for different people, as mental health is incredibly complex and there is no one-size-fits-all approach - so I can't really give you a good rundown of what to expect? Sometimes it looks like Hollywood Therapist ""tell me about your feelings,"" where they help you figure out what's going on in your head by getting you to talk it out. Sometimes they'll teach you about specific common mental distortions, then set homework on them to do every day and then analyze it and go over it when you come back in. Sometimes they'll teach you tools or tricks like specific breathing patterns, meditation, etc. Sometimes they'll get you talking and then start pointing out destructive thought patterns, then work on helping you learn to notice them. I've been in therapy for a number of years due to some pretty severe mental health issues, and all of those things are things I personally have had therapists do, and there's tons more.

In the meantime, the biggest things I can recommend are to take care of your physical health as much as possible. **Eat right, stay hydrated, sleep enough, get sunlight, get exercise** (and exercise can literally be something as small as a few jumping jacks or just walking to class instead of riding the trolley - *something*, no matter how small, is better than nothing). Those things help a ton. They don't fix it, but they take the edge off, and not doing things like eating, sleeping enough, or staying hydrated can make it *worse*.

I also recommend paying attention to your own thought patterns in the mean time. This is no substitute for actual medical care, but if you notice yourself talking down on yourself (can't do this, what's the point, never going to be good enough, gonna fail, useless, hopeless, worthless, etc), try to counteract that. In areas where your brain is trying to beat you down, think about your successes, or otherwise try to tell it why it's wrong.

If you can't think of any, that's fine - that doesn't mean there aren't any. It's a little hard to understand until you've seen it, but your brain is really good at hiding those things from you. For a common one, it's easy for people to say ""im useless no one will ever love me ill be alone forever see the proof is that I don't have a partner"" because their brain has just... stopped them from being able to see people who are hitting on them or crushing on them, or because their brain has sabotaged them to make a self-fulfilling prophecy.

And again this is NOT a substitute for actual medical advice - it's just stopgap suggestions to lessen the severity from someone who's dealt with this stuff a lot. Biggest stuff at this point is those same five things - **eat, sleep, hydrate, sun, exercise**.",Neutral,"therapy, mental health, self-care",10,2019-11-18

Unfortunately at this time we are unable to provide any financial contribution to hired friends. This is due to a lack of funding from our primary corporate sponsors, namely our parents, and the diversion of most of our funding to sustain out-of-state kids paying tuition. Do not be alarmed; we do meet 100% of demonstrated emotional need and the occasional free meal swipe if necessary. If you have any special circumstances, feel free to reach out to us and we are sure non-monetary compensation methods can be reached such as, but not limited to, laughter.

By all means, talk to people about it as well, but please, for once, instead of just telling people what to be mad at tell them what the fuck they can do about it.  And take action yourself.

comment,"Never sign a legal document without reading it in full. I know they often pressure you to quickly sign the lease right after they send you it, but you really should read it all first. All of your questions are answered by reading your lease.

From said lease:

&gt;Resident accepts financial responsibility for the full Term of the Agreement, regardless of whether the assigned
bedroom space is occupied for the duration of the full Term or at all.... **The Total Rent stated above is a fixed price for the entire Term and is payable in equal
installments for convenience; there is no proration or adjustment for any partial month of occupancy.**

From the section on termination:

&gt;Resident can terminate occupancy
by providing written notice to Owner and by fully vacating the premises, provided that in all cases **Resident will remain fully
responsible for the Total Rent that would have accrued under this Agreement, through the end of the full original Term**,
accelerated and payable at the time of termination. No exception can be made for financial hardship, academic changes, familymatters, medical issues, roommate conflict or any other reason....*[exception for if UH finds someone else to fill your lease, in which case they'll refund you the remaining rent after that person moves in]*

Continue reading the termination section and you'll see a section on what they call ""delegation."" They don't allow traditional subletting, but you can delegate to another person, which is basically subletting but done directly through UH (you remain responsible for rent if the delegate doesn't pay).",Neutral,"legal document, lease, financial responsibility, termination, subletting",8,2019-11-19

It's rough but if you have Physics 2 and Diff Eq you can get into a pre-req for ECE3710 via overrides (ECE department will want you to take that instead of ECE 2040) as a pre-req for ECE 3550, from there you are home free to take ECE 4550 and ECE 4560 if you want. ECE 4180 also counts and it looks like I'll probably end up taking both CS 3651 and ECE 4180 so I can count one for my major and one for my minor. Note that If you want your CS 3630 (CS robotics class) to count for the minor you will have to take 2 classes to replace it as it counts for both your threads for your major. Planning classes with this combo is like a O(n\^3) problem but it's possible you just need the pre-reqs to get into ECE classes.

1, Study hard from now on;

2, Memorize the things and then try to understand them completely. Knowing where they come from and how to use them are quite important;

3, Practice on the homework assignments, midterms, sample exams etc, and make sure when the numbers/conditions change, you still can get the correct answer (you will see some/a lot of similar questions in the final exam depending how nice your professor is)

4, Go to the professor's office hours as frequently as possible. Ask questions and figure out the things that confuse you. Also, many professors appreciate the hard work and good attitudes, and that might become a factor to boost your grade up when you are at the margin (unless the professor is completely an a\*\*hole);

5, Sleep well before the exam.

comment,"Not enough karma to post this as a thread:  


The entire UC system has recently divested their $80 billion endowment from fossil fuels. This has led to much attention on the issue. Last month, an article appeared in MIT's newspaper about divestment. Currently there are activists in New York fasting (since  Monday) to push Columbia University to take action divesting from fossil fuel industries.

GT has an endowment of about $2 billion. Assuming that even a small percentage of  this is invested in stocks with top coal, oil and gas companies means  tens of millions of dollars invested (likely hundreds) are not helping  with the continued building of fossil fuel reserves (already up to +2700 gigatons). For reference, it is expected that the carbon budget for keeping below +2 degrees Celsius by 2050 is less than 600 gigatons. It is unlikely that companies will be willing to lose these reserves.

What  public data is available which shows what holdings GT puts its endowment in? Assuming that the holdings are comparable to usual  portfolios and that there is indeed a sizeable investment in fossil fuels, how supportive are students of this decision to put this money  there?

comment,"As far as the actual rooms go, there‚Äôs not really a huge difference. 

Location really depends on what you‚Äôre doing. GLC was perfect for me cuz I‚Äôm a BME major so all my classes were a 7 minute walk away in the bioquad, and I wasn‚Äôt planning on ever using the dining halls again, so I never really had to go further than Howey except for going to the CRC. If you have to go to like west campus or tech square and don‚Äôt like walking, nav would be a better option with buses and such. Location sidenote: nav is good if you watch football, glc is good if you watch basketball.

Other things. GLC has a mailroom so you get your mail delivered to your building instead of the student center which is convenient. Nav has better gym(not sure where i heard that tho) and a volleyball court.

Hope that helps some.

comment,"It's not necessarily that simple. Lot of folks are struggling because of health issues that are incompatible with an educational system that assumes you are fully able to do 100% on demand. There are resources (ODS is a lifesaver), and most professors are pretty understanding, but that doesn't help when you don't know the stuff on the test because it was only covered in a class you couldn't go to due to health issues. Not does it help when there's simply not enough time in the day to do all your work without sacrificing sleep and you have a condition where sacrificing sleep can lead to terrible health issues. People often have more going on than you can see on the surface.

Other issue I found in my time as a tutor is that standard tutoring practices heavily favor people who are already doing well. Requiring someone to come in with a question depends on them knowing what's wrong, but if you're really behind then not knowing what's wrong is  the whole problem in the first place. There's a lot of systems like that where there are resources that only work if you're keeping up or ahead. Having been on both extremes (4.0 and working my butt off to do everything and acing it all vs struggling because sick), this stuff means it's very easy for one bad thing to cascade.

That's also where a lot of mental health issues happen - you, who've always done well and used the resources available to you, miss a few classes and get behind on the reading (because, idk, a parent died or w/e - in real life, stuff happens). Suddenly, you don't know what the class is talking about. You're completely lost, and a lot of times folks feel embarrassed to ask for help or just can't acknowledge to themselves what's going on. After all, a lot of times when this happens, we're talking barely-adults who don't really have any experience with either struggling with anything or with self-advocacy + living on their own. Suddenly you feel helpless, and you don't know why. You just can't keep up, can't catch up, can't understand - and that leads to feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, despair, etc, especially if you're at a selective school like Tech where most people who can get in have ""really good at school"" as part of their identity. This stuff can quickly become full-blown depression if not treated. And, hey, the counselling center is utterly inaccessible and has months-long waiting lists, sends people to (extremely expensive) private mental hospitals at the drop of a hat, and doesn't actually do therapy at all.

*This is how people die here.* Inexperienced kids hitting hardship for the first time while also entering a place that is utterly unforgiving of that. Tech is full of systems that only work for people who are already doing well, with a culture that both quietly shames not doing well enough because ""they must not be working hard"" and actively promotes terrible study habits. Folks bragging about ""I stayed up all night last night studying!"" ""well *I* pulled two all-nighters in a row!"" or w/e is terribly toxic. Cause yeah, this isn't all about systems. There's a student body culture problem we don't seem to want to acknowledge.

There's also a bunch of other stuff I typed out and then decided no one wanted to reach that much, but suffice it to say mental health issues are dramatically higher because, in part, kids don't have as much time to just... be kids. Not everyone's experiences are the same.

Also, I guarantee you a lot of this stuff was going on around you anyways. Not as much, but one of the big differences is that now we're just more *aware* of it.

If you look at the square footage you are getting more at Theory's floorplans than the others. The Standards bedrooms were tiny in comparison to Theory's. The fact that they didn't put in a massive pool deck like the Standard keeps the non-resident Frat boys out of the place and reduces the noise level I think.

My only complaint would be that the first couple of months it seemed a lot of my packages got lost because the new apartment street address was not in the mailing system or something yet.

comment,"I've been living here since August and I gotta say, it's a really nice appartment. Each living room comes with a 60ish inch (idk exactly) 4K TV which is great to not have to bring one in yourself. The furniture is also pretty modern/clean which is a plus. I currently live in a 4bed/4bath, and the room sizes are definitely a lot bigger than you would get on campus. The closet space is def bigger than what'd u get at SQ5 and I'd say the bathroom is a bit bigger too. And for $990/month (prices may have gone up since?) it's def worth.

The only complaint I really have with the place is completely subjective - I don't like the location that much. It comes in handy cuz my first class is in the IC (7 min walk) but for personal reasons I'd just rather be on east, bc of friends and stuff. Also next year I won't have classes on west so it'd be annoying to walk so far everyday to get places. Another thing about the location is that there aren't that many restaurants in short walking distance besides wingnuts, a bbq place, and a cafe (which I rarely eat there bc it's so expensive). But I think they're trying to expand retail space in the area so it could be less of an issue in the future.

Overall if you like the location then I would def consider it.",Positive,living,1,2019-11-25

Don't just focus on what's going on right now but try to look at 10 years ahead in the future: I am pretty sure you will feel regretful of the decision of dropping out. If you are feeling really bad at this moment, please try to utilize the mental health services on campus. In most cases, they can help even just a little bit.","Positive

comment,"It could be beneficial not to fully drop out, but to take a semester off. Maybe explore what you would do without a degree and see if that makes you excited to work or excited to go back to class. 

A degree is a degree no matter how long it takes to get it, and an important part of being successful in general is being able to see why you want to succeed. Do what you need to do to to refocus on your values and motivations and know that Georgia Tech opens doors of you find the spark that brought you here in the first place.",Neutral,education,25,2019-11-26
comment,"I can understand that your mind isn‚Äôt in the best place right now, and that‚Äôs okay. Everyone that commented above (and even those here that haven‚Äôt) are simply trying to let you see that you *can* do it and believe in you. Tech believes in you too, hence why the accepted you.

Now, I agree that maybe college isn‚Äôt for everyone. Is that true for you? What do you intend to do if you were to drop out right now? Do you have another passion? I ask these because these are all things i asked myself (and still do) whenever I get in a bad place and also contemplate dropping out bc quite frankly, I too feel constantly lonely and anxious here. Ultimately, I don‚Äôt have an answer to those questions and I stay. Most people are right, in the grand scheme, these 4-5 years are minimal in the span of your life and offer a greater security for the future. Second, if you don‚Äôt have a passion, it‚Äôs probably the best place to find it (and if somehow from there you decide college gets in the way of that passion, by all means, safely drop out if it‚Äôll make you happy). Until then, I strongly suggest to give it a try. As cliche as it is, quoting Steve Jobs from a commencement he gave, a lot of stuff won‚Äôt make sense now thinking forward, but it will all make crystal clear sense looking backwards in the future: you really do have to have a little faith that somehow those dots in your life that might not make sense now will all connect in the future.

It‚Äôs rough. Especially now with finals around the corner. Just know that we all believe in you, grades are by no means the best judgment of everything you know, and nobody thinks of your intelligence any less for how you perform on these exams (and if they do, they can go fuck themselves). You got this buddy. If you ever, or anyone for that matter, ever wants to talk‚Äîin text or in person‚Äîby all means please please do reach out (I am socially awkward/anxious too tho so heads up).

The whole parking system gets flipped upside down for game day. My best recommendation for a metered lot with the least amount of issues would probably be the top of Curran deck on west campus.

One year, when the GT Band was rehearsing at uGA, the band went to the pregame interlocking GT set (formation), and every musician dropped fast-growing grass seeds where they were standing. After a few weeks or so, the new grass had outgrown the original grass and made a very obvious GT logo. uGA first attempted mowing the grass away but eventually had to replace the entire field.

The next year, uGA bandmembers brought grass seed to GT's campus in retribution. They got to the dwagiest set they had, dropped the seed, and proudly let GT know what they had done in retribution.

Fortunately, being an artificial turf field, nothing grew, but that didn't occur to the peons in Athens.

*This story has been passed down verbally for years. No doubt I got some details wrong, but the story is true. The grass dropping and retribution all happened. If anyone has anything to add to the story, please comment it!",Neutral,"bands, rivalry, pranks, tradition",53,2019-11-27

Personally hate it that if we live in a right to work state, I can't actually choose to work somewhere else, but I do understand why reneging is terrible for the company.

comment,"Side rant here, the fact that the school is involved with the internship process here is utterly bizarre to me. At my undergrad, the school was not involved in the internship process at all. It was on the student if they wanted to burn a bridge and accept a better offer. It should always be between the student and the company. The school has no reason to get involved at all.

comment,"Why is this being downvoted?  It's a fair question.

You're ""allowed"" to reneg at least in the sense that you won't get kicked out of school or anything.  But basically, once you say yes to an offer it should actually mean yes, or C2D2 will get pissed and might refuse to work with you to get permanent employment, which might be a bad thing.  So this really might not be a good idea unless the new company is among your dream companies, the role relates directly to what you want to be doing, and you think there's a high probability of getting a permanent offer from them.

The reasoning for this policy is that it's sometimes tough for companies once they've allocated funding to fill that position with a quality candidate sometimes, and then if GT gets a rep for having students that hang companies out to dry those companies will offer GT students fewer internships.  This not only hurts GT but future GT students too.

It's all kind of moot until you actually get that other offer though.  It might be worth interviewing and then you can make a decision then.

On the plus side, it's only Thanksgiving and if you were to reach out the them early and explain you got an unexpected offer that you think you're an even better fit for they might understand, and they might be grateful for a chance to extend an offer instead to another candidate who might be more likely to take a permanent position there.  Or they might be pissed that they have to start interviewing again for a slot they thought they already had filled after all the good candidates have committed elsewhere, because that costs them time and money too.

Whatever you do, just don't start thinking you might goad these companies into a bidding war.  That would just piss off **EVERYONE** and you'll end up with no internship and no help from GT getting permanent employment either.

Edit: I knew a grad student who tried the bidding war thing when something like this happened.  It didn't go well, and that's only why I mentioned it.  It might work for experienced hires in hard-to-fill positions but that's about it, and it's a terrible idea for interns and new grads.",Neutral,"internship, job offers, companies, bidding war.",4,2019-11-29

comment,"It‚Äôs tough to expect some students to stand up to exploding offers without a school backing them. If you finally got your first offer and they give you a day to accept, you will likely accept out of concern of not having any job, even if others may be coming. Recruiters know this and know that students are poor at navigating these situations, which is why exploding offers exist in the first place.

It‚Äôs definitely a lot different from the LinkedIn example. You don‚Äôt have to clear it with the school to renege, you just can‚Äôt participate in their fair anymore if you do. Just like how you might lose a connection with a third party recruiting organization if you renege on an a company they have a relationship with. 

I forget the specific school, but one of the University of California system schools had a few big tech companies not show up for a few years due to the students‚Äô reputation for reneging on offers. 

In the end, Georgia Tech has to balance its protection of students and the interests of the companies with which they have relationships with.

1) the elevators in my building break one or twice a week. Really annoying if you're trying to bring something up to the 6th floor.

2) there's been a few doors (the ones closest to the BBQ restaurant) that just don't work anymore. Someone ripped the door handle off in early September and they haven't fixed it yet. I've gone in to the leasing office multiple times to ask them to fix it and they say they're working on it.

3) the trash chute on my floor keeps going down. The trash chute door stops opening, and everyone just starts putting their trash bags on the floor of the trash chute room. Pretty gross.

4) the rooms are big, but they aren't as big as, say, arium (down the street), and we're paying a premium to live here.

5) the package system was really bad at the beginning. There was a day where they booted everyone out of the system, so we had to sign back up again to start receiving packages. They never sent out an email saying this happened, so lots of people were losing packages.

comment,"So I'm a relatively short guy. I'm 5'4"". Does it bother me...not really, but I get alot of comments from people either joking or just straight up being pricks sometimes. 

I also happen to be a Martial arts instructor and usually teach classes for children, teens, and occasionally adults. I really love teaching the ""Little Tigers"" (ages 4-6) and the white/yellow belts (lower belts). I really love working with them because they try really hard and when they get the lightbulb moment, it's great. Their faces light up and they practice it a hundred times until it's perfect. 

My favorite memory of this comes from when I first started and my first group of white belts came through. It's been approximately 4 years since I started working with my dojo and these white belts have worked up the belt ranks now to were many of them are testing for their Junior Black Belts. 

One of the best compliments I ever received was from the second black belt test for this group in which the majority of them tested. At the very end, all of my students graduated. They all came up and dog-piled me. It was the best feeling. I started tearing up. The parents all came up to me, many of whom I consider my family. They said thank you and such but these kids looked up to me and said thank you and shared so much sweat and tears and years of hard work with me. 

Yet, the best compliment I have ever received is this: a student named E, a super hardworking student always trying her best and never leaving class without a smile, came up to me and said that I was tall. Her reasoning was that it was too hard for her to do head kicks. It made me laugh and smile so hard. I challenged her that she should stretch and try again and when she could get a head kick in then I would teach a class that would focus on something she was interested in. (Ex. If she wanted to do jumping kicks, I would dedicate ~15 minutes to jumping kicks). Well, a year later, E was ~6inches taller, and finally knocked me. She came back and said ""I finally did it but now my next goal is to be as good as you."" It made me cry that day. 

Finally, the last one that hit me emotionally the most was the day I left my studio for Tech. I had worked there for 2 years and 328 days (I counted because that's how much this job and all my students meant to me, and I cherish every single one of those days). For the week leading up to it, my boss hid this entire operation from me. He asked that each student make a card for me if they wanted to, if the parents wanted to make one they could, asked each student to sign a poster if they wanted to, etc. I left my final day of work at 9pm when we closed. My dojo is in this small strip mall and I have this habit of everytime I close up, I grab food from a supermarket store on the same strip. Well, I walked into the store after locking up, and there was my students and their families. It was my family. They were waiting for me there because they knew I'd be there. My boss handed me a poster filled with 100+ signatures of students and a sack of cards. Like, a  Santa sized sack of cards. 

I cried for weeks and I miss my students/my families and friends that I made from that job everyday. That was the pinnacle compliment I ever received: being told that I was truly loved by the friends and family I had made along the way. Not the family I was born with, but the families that truly cherished me. Hundreds of kids that all look at me as their mentor and I look at them as my kids (and I truly feel that way, once they were on that mat, they were mine. I took care of them and I made sure that they were having fun and we're good both on and off that mat). The parents of those kids treated me like a son and I felt accepted. That's the best compliment I received. 

I could go all day telling each and every redditor on this feed about my experiences at my studio. Thank you for allowing me to tell this story.

Applied physics you will take Electronics I/II and Computational Physics instead of Quantum Mechanics II and Statistical Mechanics. Also, I am a Physics Major currently",Neutral,physics,9,2019-11-30
comment,"The two are pretty interchangeable, and if you change you‚Äôre mind it‚Äôs very easy to switch from one to the other. The main difference between the two is that you would have to take Quantum 2 and Stat Mech for Physics, but instead you would take Electronics (both one and two I believe?) in Applied Physics. You could take all of these classes in either major, it just changes whether it‚Äôs required or not. 

As for if there is a better option for you, it depends on what you want your primary major to be and what you want to do after you leave tech.

I realize we will never come close to having the kind of athletes that they do on such a large scale. I never wanted to get rid of Paul Johnson because no matter the complaints people had about him I never felt there was a game we couldn‚Äôt win. I was embarrassed this year. The only good thing I can say is that I heard more about recruiting in two weeks of the new coach than 2 yrs with Paul Johnson but that could have just as easily been solved by hiring a guy like the new coach to do nothing but recruiting. I gave up my season tickets at the beginning of this year because the turnout by tech fans and students was atrocious. I had season tickets for over 20 years but I honestly was so thankful I didn‚Äôt have to be in that stadium today sitting next to some drunk, loud  piece of shit Ga. fan. It was embarrassing seeing other teams fans fill our stadium. I wish tech people would just burn their fucking tickets instead of selling them.

Also, its a bit worrisome that this post immediately talks about comparing treating the stress of GT students similar to the stress of cancer patients.... Either we are downplaying the stress of cancer patients, or we are saying that GT academics are similar to cancer.

B) humor.gatech.edu doesn't lead to anything as of this comment.
