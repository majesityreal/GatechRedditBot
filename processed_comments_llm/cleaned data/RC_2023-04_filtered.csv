In the long run, I'm actually really glad that I got a pathway right out of highschool - I came from a tiny highschool in middle Georgia, and had no one else that graduated with me who also wanted to go to Tech. My mental health was poor, and my standards were unrealistic (thanks to only taking AP's in HS).

I just Google for ""five minute guided morning meditation"" on YouTube. I do it first thing before I get out of bed, then switch over to one of those ""happiness tone"" vids while I do a stream-of-consciousness gratitude journal.

It's been amazing how much better I feel starting the day with positivity rather than dreading getting out of bed. I find myself excited to take on my challenges during the day, and I didn't think that was possible for me.

So take it from someone finishing up a PhD: take your mental health seriously. Making a habit of taking care of yourself can pay dividends. Just give it a shot for one week and see if it helps.

comment,"Hi!

I recently got the arts and sciences pathway offer and am planning on enrolling for my sophomore year (fall 2024). I had a few questions and I'm hoping some of y'all could take some time out to answer them!

1. I'm planning on enrolling as a math major at Purdue for my freshman year (and the same when I come to GaTech, assuming I fulfil the requirements). I'm wondering how my final transcript from GaTech will look. Will my Purdue grades appear on my final transcript from GaTech? Or will it directly start from sophomore year (albeit that sounds kinda wrong I won't lie)
2. How easy is taking up a minor at GaTech? I want to take CS as a minor and I know CS 1331 is a requirement and it's really hard to enrol because of course size problems. Can I bypass the 1331 requirement by taking a course equivalent at Purdue? CS 17700 at Purdue gives me transfer credits for CS 1301 and CS 1XXX at GaTech according to [https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P\_find\_state](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_state). Will this let me bypass the 1331 requirement? Also can I even take a minor from the College of Computing if I'm in the College of Science?
3. How will co-ops work? I know GaTech generally does it between the junior and senior year for most students so do I not have to worry about it as I'm coming in during my sophomore year?
4. If there are any transfer students at GaTech reading this, do you think transferring is worth it? GaTech is my dream school and I was kinda bummed when I saw this offer but I'm really excited now as I get a chance to actually go to my dream school!!! I want to know your thoughts though

I'm sorry, this is a lot to read😭

I would really appreciate any answers or advice though, thank you so much in advance

The current runner-up is UCI, which is about $12k cheaper per year for me as I am OOS for GT. If you guys could please give me reasons to choose GT I would greatly appreciate it.

I’m sure UCI has a very solid CS program, though it isn’t rated as highly as GT’s, and you’re bound to learn enough to get you into a good job assuming the job market isn’t fucked like it is now when you graduate. However GT has much higher “brand name” value which can do wonders to boost your resume compared to other candidates. Additionally, networking at GT is likely to get you in contact with more people who can provide opportunities for internship and FT referrals. Campus culture is also probably different and the more grind-heavy culture at tech can be a pro or a con depending on what you want, but personally the rigor and difficulty of GT courses forced me to work harder and prepared me better for what is a very competitive job market rn.

UCLA is also very good though, so there are probably factors that matter more than recruitment. If in state, UCLA is a ton cheaper, and not having to do college in 3 years to compensate can relieve a ton of pressure.

Another factor to consider is how dead set are you on CS. If you might consider a switch to engineering, GT suddenly has a lot more value. If you might want to add on another major in say a humanities, this is not the place for that.

I'm 100% going to be doing CS at both schools, so other majors are not in consideration / of concern. I also plan to stay in California, and most likely the Bay Area after college.

About the 3 years thing, I'm not really pressured to pursue with that plan due to cost of attendance, as my family is fortunately able to comfortably afford the OOS cost. I guess it would be nice to put my credits to use, and saving money is always nice. But it's not of highest priority, and I'm willing to pay more for a better college + post-grad experience. For reference Georgia Tech will be around 51K per year, and UCLA will be around 37K per year.

I think the main things drawing me to Georgia Tech is academics (the STEM focus, the rigor of the curriculum + threads, career fairs, larger CS department and research).

comment,"51 vs 37 is a lot smaller difference than I thought it'd be. This is definitely a conversation worth having.

Seems like you have a good handle on what the major differences are. I'd say that, while the UCLA network is strong in the bay, it's not really that ""proximal"", i.e. I highly doubt you'll ever go there during college without a job offer or smth.

I'll throw 2 more considerations out there. For one, GT is definitely more rigorous. I'm finishing up 3+1 thing you're talking about (interned in the Bay and going there for full time), and have several friends doing the same. We've all had our fair share share of hell weeks and all nighters. I've seen my friends' coursework at UCLA, and there is a noticeable difference. If you want to have a traditional, partying/socializing college experience , UCLA will treat you better. But if you're a grinder who likes pushing yourself, GT will serve you well.

Second is a bit more subjective. How much do you love California? Cus growing up in state there, going to college there, and doing CS (i.e. likely going to Silicon Valley) means you'll be spending a ton of your life there. So if you love CA, that's awesome. If you want to temporarily try a different part of the country though, GT enables that.

There's a nice little GT network in the Bay too. The UCLA network is definitely bigger, but there are pros and cons to that. You're more likely to see a fellow UCLA grad, but they're pretty common, so it's not a huge talking point. If I see a fellow GT grad in the Bay, it's a real connection point.

Our air conditioning stopped working during the coldest days of winter. After reporting the issue, management fixed it one week later, but it broke down again after just one day. Also, my bed is bent, and management placed a twin mattress on a twin XL frame lol.

I believe they have increased the rent from $910 to $1000. Additionally, I believe the utility fee increased from $0 to $100. So it is not as cheap as it was.  
Please also buy earphones with ANC. I live on the first floor, the road noise is always a problem. I can hear loud bass music from passing cars even during the midnight hours.

As a first-grader and an international student, I am unsure if these problems are common here. However, I would prefer to spend an additional $100 to find a better living space.

comment,"I chose GT over UCSD (I'm from San Diego) and am really glad I did. I found that I really liked the culture at GT as well as the amount of resources provided to students. GT's number of students and overall campus size is also smaller than UCSD, which is something that I found to be more fitting for me. 

Also, GT's change of major is much nicer than UCSD's. I have friends that want to switch to CS, but the UC system makes it nearly impossible for them.  GT makes it really easy to change your major either before you start or during a later semester. I changed my major from ME to CS after two years, which wouldn't have happened if I was at UCSD. 

I would say that GT is more rigorous than UCSD (I've dropped by a few of their classes with my friends during breaks just for fun lol), but both are fantastic schools.

comment,"From what I understand, UCSD is known to be a bit stronger than UCLA in engineering, but it has a slightly weaker brand, so it's probably a wash overall, i.e. expect roughly the same recruiting outcomes for CS in CA. Probably weaker out of state though.

I'd say the same main factors apply: cost, sureness that you want to do CS, desire for rigor, and geographic preference.

I guess a good question to ask yourself: how much do you want to shake up your life? In state—UCSD—cushy SWE job is a tried and true path. Assuming you like CA, you'll probably have a good time and good life.

GT has higher risk/reward. Some people absolutely do not hold up to the rigor and struggle to just get out. Some people thrive on the grind and use it to really accelerate their personal growth, landing roles out of college they didn't know exist (I was one of these).

Maybe you go become a fintech SWE in NY or a data scientist for a consulting firm (you usually need an MS for the latter). Maybe you fall in love with some niche research field and go do a PhD. Maybe you just go back to CA as a SWE anyway (though I'd argue GT will prep you better for it).

comment,"Hey. I was in your shoes as well. I think there are a couple things that helped:

1. Side projects: hackathons, your own projects, joining clubs (eg: DSGT, Big Data Big Impact, Greyhat, Bits of Good, etc) that get you exposure to building something are important. Tech is changing and in this world, showing your ability to learn new tools and APPLY them to solve a problem of your interest is important. Thats what you want your resume to convey. 

2. Find or create opportunities to improve your communication skills. I get that introvertedness has its strengths but being able to communicate and deal with other people on the team is crucial to showing that you can be a team player. Examples include TAing for a class, undergrad research, creating your own project or initiative and assembling a team, leadership positions in clubs on campus, etc. You want to convince people that you have experience working with people and you know how to deal with a difficult teammate

3. Taking your classes seriously. I know people will disagree but building good study and work habits matter. If you do everything last minute, that doesnt work long term speaking from experience. Start every assignment early so that you can maximize your learning and retention (remember long term memory is important to optimize on). When it comes to learning, focus on develooping the core understanding behind the concepts. Don't memorize the random nitty gritty. Details serve to clarify the big idea. I recommend for CS to learn a concept by doing! Go to lectures and you will be able to grow your network by making friends with your classmates and getting to know the profs. They aren't scary people!

4. Leverage your Network. It's perfectly okay to ask for people to help give you feedback on resumes, communication skills, coding skills, etc. You dont have to do everything by yourself and struggle alone. In fact, asking for help is an important skill in industry. Closed mouths dont get fed as they say.

comment,"UC Berkeley or Georgia Tech for mechanical engineering?

I was recently admitted to both schools as an international student and I'm trying to choose between the two. I understand that both have amazing ME programs but would like to know about how the program differs between both schools. For example, how much hands on work is incorporated in classes, how flexible is the curriculum, and how good are the professors. 

Here's a bit of what I'm looking for in a school:

I'm interested in competition clubs that have a lot of hands on work. I'm also interested in entrepreneurship so any programs that help with that are desirable. I like the invention studio at GT and would like to know if there's a similar facility at Berkeley. I also like the concentrations, specifically the robotics concentration, at GT and would like to know if there's something similar at Berkeley.

Location wise I think Berkeley would be nicer but I don't really mind living in Atlanta.

comment,">I went to UGA my first year and then transferred. I would say it’s definitely worth it for any major, even business. Tech is overall a much better school academically, and to be honest the location of being in Atlanta is waaaaay better then Athens. In your essays, do a little research about the program you are transferring into. For example, if you’re transferring to mechanical engineering, talk about the labs and machinery available to you as a tech student, and any student programs about your incoming major you can find. Show that you have done your research on tech as a school and why you are the right fit.

I'm an upcoming UGA freshman and plan to transfer to GT for CS. Do you have any tips/advice for how I can ensure a successful freshman year and increase my chances of getting into GT?

My questions and would appreciate whatever you can answer based on your experience: 

As a Tech student, are there significantly more industry opportunities than at UT Austin? Do most CS students take a semester for co-op or they use internships to build up experience? Do clubs, hackathons legitimately add to experience? It seems like the environment is collaborative but would be good to hear the take of current students.

Always keep an eye out your first week for class openings with better professors in the drop/add period. Some will open up.

Also, don't buy anything from the bookstore. Get your books elsewhere like libgen or used somewhere. You won't need them immediately most likely, but if you do you can make a friend with someone who has it or just download.

My favorite food places are Velvet Taco, Hattie B's, and Jeni's in west midtown. Visit krog street market/walk the beltline for some good food too. If you're in freshman housing, grab some people from your floor and go check out town!

There's definitely something for everybody on campus, and you should go meet as many groups on campus during the welcome org fair. Rowing team will approach you aggressively.

comment,"I’m not a professional but I did look at acceptance rates when apply for colleges as C/O 2027: a lot of universities had their acceptance rates drop (everything from
Harvard going down a few points, to GA Tech and Emory roughly halving their acceptance rate). If I had to guess on what happened, I think a blend of a growing applicant pool of students who want to go to Tech from in state and out of state. 
 
   To touch on Instate students, I haven’t seen the statistics but I would believe that group of applicants grew in size drastically as  the amount of students will Zell
Miller likely rose (covering all base tuition costs as you perhaps know). And now, yes, Zell can be hard to acquire for some applicants, but most GA Tech applications coming from in state already qualifies for Zell Miller as a part of the requirements to have a shot into going to today’s GA Tech. 

So when you account for the idea that more students are wanting to go to college, the rising appeal of GA Tech, and the “reduction” of costs for in state students with Zell Miller, a trend towards a lower acceptance rate might be possible just like with Boston College years ago. 


I’ll read over this later since it’s early in the morning here, but I hope I made sense on my theory. Have a nice day! :)",Neutral,"college acceptance rates, in-state students, zell miller scholarship, growing applicant pool, rising appeal of ga tech, costs, boston college.",11,2023-04-04

comment,"This is an information post for summer conditional transfer students and other pathways. 

Due to the system whatever happened on the day of release, deposits were not able to be submitted and then later waived but at least for me, this caused concern about how to accept the transfer and let them know the commitment. 

As far as a call to the Department of Undergraduates went, the best answer they could give me is that you are acknowledged to be committed once you attend a FASET orientation and sign up for classes, but until then there is nothing more to do besides complete the rest of the new student checklist.

For final transcripts not being available until the week that classes start, advisors will be available at your FASET orientations and can assist you with selecting classes based on the information you give them and does not rely on a submitted final transcript. Just make sure to get it in as soon as you can and make sure it has high school courses that counted as college credits on it too.

If you haven't already, get your immunizations scheduled immediately as the doctor's office is going to be swamped and you don't want to have your move-in day happen without your immunizations completed.

On the topic of housing, at least for me, housing applications have opened and you can submit your application for summer housing. The faster you submit the application the higher on the waitlist you can be and get the chance at better rooms. With the three options available from what I've found online Woodruff is supposedly pretty bad and North Ave South/Eighth street west are the better options. Eighth street west is way northwest of campus and is pretty far away from everything. Personally, I think that North Ave South is the better option and both NAS and ESW are listed at the same cost. But the selection is a personal preference.

With all the complications that have happened, it can create a lot of worries, but the Office of Undergraduate Admissions is always available for questions, just don't wait to ask!

If, as you suggested the people were not students, then their perspective is different, they aren’t students and obviously don’t care about disrupting a class, otherwise they wouldn’t have done it. I’m sure they understood that police could be called and that the people they were antagonizing would likely not enjoy being antagonized.

comment,"Back in my day, one of the prospective student programs allowed high schoolers interested in Tech to visit campus and even sign up to sit in on a lecture to see what it is like. I wonder if they're on campus for a similar program or something, potentially reluctantly.     

I will say, tech students aren't immune to being shit-disturbing influencer wanna-bes either. I visited campus last year host an information session with my out of state company to recruit tech students. Pretty much everyone we meet was great, but there was one student who told us he wanted to be an influencer and was using CS at Georgia Tech as a backup career who kept messing with our props while a friend recorded him, obviously trying to get a reaction out of us (a reaction we didn't give him). I'm glad most of my team is made up of Tech alums and know the real quality of tech students, because behavior like that could have resulted in our feedback being don't come back to tech if we didn't.","Negative

Context: I'm in state for ucla, so it's about 39k compared to 50k for georgia tech. I'm leaning fairly heavily towards ucla, but I also think i'm biased by other people in my life, so if yall have any reasons for attending georgia tech i'd love to hear them. also curious on which would be better for my future career

UCLA (\~39k per year)

* cheaper price
* LA location
* faang recruiting boost bc cali?
* amazing education
* amazing food :)
* ap/community college credits transfer easily
* more ""overall prestige""

Georgia Tech (\~50k per year)

* slightly more expensive
* atlanta has a big tech scene
* technically higher ranking
* maybe better recruiting? (not sure)
* engineering is probably better known
* tech school mindset? not that big of a deal to me but i think i fit that more

Dont forget: right now is college visiting week since a lot of high schoolers are on break and many families have been touring campus. With all the jokes aside of current students telling the prospective applicants or acceptees to ""not come here because it sucks"", I feel bad and a little embarrassed that this sort of thing happened at a well known public school, a school that many people set their eyes on when they begin college applications. If I saw this happen, Im not sure if I would be too ecstatic to come here. Tech was my true dream school that I realistically saw myself attending since it met a lot of the criteria I was looking for. I was so excited when I got conditional transfer and eventually got accepted, thinking this would be a new fresh start for me. Now, seeing this happen makes my heart sink, because not only does it taint my college experience here, but it also would sort of look bad on the school if prospective students saw this. I really hope that if any high schoolers see or hear about this post or the case in general that this school is not like this at all, I think Tech has so many other amazing things to offer and if handled correctly you can have a great time here and grow personally intellectually.",Neutral,"education, college, prospective students, college visits, campus culture, public image",7,2023-04-04

Seeing these people disrupt the class and ruining the learning environment is sad because so many of us pay a fortune in tuition and other costs, only for us to not be able to learn.

Quant finance is a field that's all about using math and computer models to make money in the financial markets. Think of it like a big puzzle - you're trying to figure out how all the pieces fit together, and use that knowledge to make smart investments and trades.

Companies like Jane Street and Citadel are the best of the best in this field - they have some of the smartest people working for them, and they're always coming up with new and innovative ways to make money. If you're obsessed with money and want to work at one of these companies, you'll need to be really good at math and computer programming. You'll also need to be able to think on your feet and make quick decisions, because the markets move fast and you'll need to stay ahead of the curve.

But if you can make it at one of these companies, the rewards can be huge. You could earn a lot of money, and you'll be working with some of the most talented people in the industry. Plus, you'll be at the cutting edge of finance, using technology and data to make money in ways that most people can't even imagine. So if you're passionate about making money and you're willing to work hard, quant finance could be the perfect career for you!",Positive,quant finance,40,2023-04-05

I'm a CS major trying to get a few Management Certifications, and GT-Scheduler indicates that there's only one version of this class available for the Fall 2023 term (specifically looking for ML for Business). Since these classes do not pertain to my CS major or threads, my advisor refuses to offer information about them. Does anybody know how to determine when other versions are available or any other information. If not, who should I contact to figure this out before Fall 2023 registration begins.

With that being said, the college that I am currently at took all of my AP credits and assigned course equivalencies **that are visible on my transcript**. 

Since the AP scores that I put on the application aren't high enough to fulfill those requirements, will they look at my college transcript for the ""Credits by Exam"" awarded by my college, or should I send an email to undergraduate admissions clarifying this?

comment,"I’m having trouble deciding between schools, I’m looking for a career in Biotech or Mech Engineering. 

I was recently accepted into four colleges: Stony Brook, Georgia Tech, WPI, and Clarkson University. I’m having trouble deciding between them. More info is below. 

Majors: 
Mechanical Engineering at Stony Brook. 
Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Tech. 
Double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering at WPI. 
Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering at Clarkson.

Cost: 
Clarkson and Stonybrook would be about the same cost, WPI and Georgia Tech would be about the same cost, With WPI/Georgia Tech being about 15-20k more than Clarkson or Stony Brook. Realistically, finance is not a major concern, but definitely not something to be disregarded. 

Other information: 
I am in the honors college at Stony Brook. I currently live in Buffalo NY, so I am used to colder weather/snow.

I have a 3.8 overall GPA and 3.5 math and natural science GPA, the minimum requirement for both is a 3.3 to qualify for the APS (atlanta public school) pathway. I have all the class requirements for transfer. I'm really nervous about admission and have a feeling something will go wrong and I won't get in. I have no idea if this pathway is guaranteed admission, as they refuse to use the word on the website and I've never heard of anyone transferring through APS. It's a fairly new pathway which is probably the reason for the lack of info online. If anyone has gotten in on APS, I would love to hear about it. Also I didn't get an email offer for this pathway, you just have to have a 3.3+, apply from an atlanta public school, and meet all transfer requirements. I assume they will consider you for the pathway through the usual transfer application? I'm not sure.",Neutral,"admission, transfer, gpa, application, pathway, anxiety, information.",1,2023-04-05

comment,"ngl, i spend the first few days of ramadan feeling really sad and disconnected from my spirituality. it's really difficult to pull myself out of that mentality- i'm not even sure why it happens. so ur definitely not alone in this- Allah puts us through difficult emotions at times to learn more about ourselves and the nature of this dunya. comparing your experience or even yourself to others - especially when it comes to spirituality, ramadan, islam, or even genuine joy in this holy month- is the fastest way to kill any seed that may be beginning to sprout. 

&#x200B;

i know it's hard. it doesn't have to be like this, inshAllah. if you need someone to talk to, or pray next to, or listen to Quran with, or literally just break your fast with- i can be that person inshAllah. there's a lot of people at tech who want to genuinely give love and community to whoever comes searching. that is the nature of islam, after all. 

&#x200B;

alhamdulillah. biggest piece of advice i can give you is to say your shukr, cry, break down, and have tawakkul in Allah. it's all normal, but the only way out is through. inshAllah, whenever you need there's a community of warmth and acceptance waiting for you at tech. may Allah make this easier on you.

if you’re finding it a bit difficult to invest your energy in a lot of ramadany things, maybe start with one thing and try being consistent w/ that. like if you’re finding it hard to sleep, use some of that quiet time to just talk to Allah regularly.

again, try not to compare your ramadan experience with others. it isn’t meant to be a 30-day spiritual high, the goal is to grow over the course of the month, and it def seems like you’re doing that by reaching out. also just pu to the msa events :) they’re vibey",Neutral,"spirituality, struggle, ramadan, connection, comparison, growth, advice, community.",7,2023-04-05

All right? The originals were simple.

They were just thousands
of AAA mortgages bundled together,

guaranteed by the U.S. government.

The modern ones are different.

They're private. And they're
made up of layers of tranches.

The highest level, AAA,
is getting paid first.

The lowest rated, B, is getting paid last,
taking on defaults first.

Now, obviously, if you're buying B's,
you could make more money.

But they're a little risky.

Sometimes they fail.

Chris?

Somewhere along the line,
these B's and BB's

went from a little risky

comment,"ive been having a VERY hard time deciding between CS programs. Right now my options are either ut dallas for 18k or georgia tech for 50k 💀. i know that utd sounds like the most obvious option in terms of short term cost, but im thinking that georgia tech would be more worth it in the long run (?). georgia tech isnt tooooo much of an issue to pay for, but its still a bit of a stretch.... additionally i feel that the prestige of georgia techs program really represents my high school work, which i'm not sure applies as much to utd. can anyone help or give me guidance? i dont know much about utd's program, so i want to know how it compares...

ps: i am currently admitted as a ds student at utd, but i plan on switching and then possibly getting a masters later. does the cost of georgia tech enable a master's degree soon after (i want to specialize in data science post-grad) please help ‼",Neutral,"college, computer science, cost, prestige, program, masters, data science",1,2023-04-06
comment,">Why would they also wait to roll this change out right before registration???

The new interface has actually been rolled out for a year now. They've been piloting this since last March and there were even workshops that taught you how to use it. The most recent change was that you can no longer access the old interface. At the very least, you can't say they didn't warn everyone that this was coming. FWIW, there appear to be instructional videos on [this](https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/registration-assistance#registering-for-a-basic-course) page, which was linked in an email sent on March 19th.

As for who's responsible, your complaints lie with the [Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia](https://www.usg.edu/regents/members) and with [Ellucian Company L.P.](https://www.ellucian.com/) The latter wrote the software and the former is why we have to use it.",Negative,"registration, complaints, interface, responsibility.",78,2023-04-06

Registering on the 12th doesn't sound that bad in the grand scheme of things. The latest time tickets for undergrads don't open until the 17th. 

AP/DE credits are included in credit hours for time tickets, so someone with 60+ hours coming in would register at a similar time as a rising third year with 60 hours. I don't agree with this, but that's how it is done.",Neutral,"registration, time tickets, credit hours",2,2023-04-07

comment,"I'm in developer education and am happy to talk about it including doing 1:1 calls if any GT students are seriously interested, but if you are graduating soon it's a tough time in the industry in general and thus I suspect not an easy time to break into developer education because as a specialty field there's a smaller number of roles, and people frequently switch into developer education mid career.

 If you are considering this direction right now the reality is that you may need to work in CS or sales engineering, or as a standard SWE first - because every company needs a number of those right away. This is not as bad as it sounds because all of those will give you desirable skills for the role.

The main way to increase your chances of breaking in is to start coding in public, a lot, and start teaching. Social media, streams, giving talks, blog posts.

However, you don't need a program at all to break into the industry, those are really mostly if you want to work in BigTech, there are places that hire juniors without programs.

What I suggested for developer education - coding in public - will generally offset any GPA challenges for most roles. It's a very valuable skill to cultivate for you personally because you build a network that will help you find roles.

comment,"uiuc or gatech cs if i want to go into quant?

i’m an admitted student for fall 2023 for pure cs at uiuc and gatech. i’m interested in machine learning/quant/trading and i was wondering how the opportunities compare. if anyone has insight on differences in course difficulties that would be very much appreciated too! 

important note!!!! i will be graduating debt free either way so cost doesn’t matter too much. also i am a woman in cs but it doesn’t seem like there’s a huge difference in terms of support for women in cs

here’s a pro con list i have so far:
georgia tech
pro:
* t5 for cs
* $50k a year
* easy commute (2 hour flight and 20 minute car ride from airport)
* in atlanta (big city)
* lots of research opps 
* recruiting is easy 
* ok campus, prettier than uiuc
* lots of major flexibility

con:
* housing in atlanta is expensive
* no good nearby boba
* registration might be rough bc no cap on cs transfers
* dorms are hit or miss too
* food is bad
* hot and humid (will need to get straightening perm)
* dangerous off campus
* super engineering focused and i don’t want to be only surrounded by engineering stuff all the time
* i like gold but the gold just looks like mustard yellow on merch

uiuc
pro:
* t5 for cs
* easy course registration, should be able to get all the cs classes i need and want w ease
* not hot or humid 
* lots of yummy food and boba options around
* super safe on and off campus
* cheap off campus housing
* single use bathrooms in dorms 😝😝
* average starting salary is higher at uiuc
* research park has super easy interviews for uiuc students so i can do internships for up to $30/hour while taking classes
* emphasis on interdisciplinary stuff

con:
* 60k a year (10k more than tech)
* annoying commute (2 hour flight and then 2.5 hour bus ride to campus)
* bad location
* tornadoes and blizzards
* kinda ugly campus
* dorms are hit or miss
* not much flexibility with changing major (cannot transfer back into cs if i transfer out)
* orange 😟😟😟",Neutral,"comparison, opportunities, course difficulty, cost, women in cs, pro con list, georgia tech, uiuc, cs, quant, machine learning, trading, housing, food, campus, safety, flexibility, gold, boba, registration, dorms",3,2023-04-07

I did not even feel brave enough to request accomodations from my professors or even talk about fasting with my friends, because so many of them were openly discriminatory to me (this was around the time of 9/11)... Glad to see times have changed and people are supportive in the comments. This diversity and change of times are beautiful to see at Tech.

comment,"Going to add to the comments about CARE not being a great resource- I went during my 2nd year bc my diagnosed chronic depression was acting up heavy due to academic and social stress. 

I guess since my grades were good and I wasn’t drinking or doing drugs the person screening me decided all I needed was this weekly group meditation class. I did go to several meetings but dropped it because it didn’t really help with my depression/anxiety. It just felt like something they held so they could say look, we DO provide resources! I tried to advocate for myself and ask them to p l e a s e help me get psych services on or closer to campus but they said they reserve those resources for crises or for students coming from far away. The usual “you’re not sick enough, maybe try again when you are”.

I thought maybe this had changed in couple years that have passed but judging by the comments they are still unable or unwilling to provide preventive, comprehensive, and sustainable mental health care and resources for GT students. I see that they provide some free therapy sessions but imo it can be really difficult to start therapy and have to switch therapists (after the free sessions expire) so I would be cautious with doing that. 

Good luck, OP. I’m sorry I don’t have many answers for you but it does get better.",Negative,mental health care,3,2023-04-08

Pros: NYC, I feel that its more adventurous, can pursue a minor, easier to escape if I don't want to do engineering, northern climate

At worst, if that doesn't occur, you can still show up on graduation day dressed and ready to go. They allow walk-ins as long as they have the room for it (and ever since they moved graduation to Bobby dodd, the staffers told me theres like a 99% chance there will be extra room), they'll let you in and walk.

comment,"For trading roles, quant firms recruit almost exclusively out of Ivy+ schools. Like if you go on LinkedIn and look at the traders at top firms like Jane Street, most of them were Math/Physics/CS majors from Harvard/MIT/Princeton/Stanford/Columbia/Penn/UChicago. Although, this might be self selection to a certain extent. Because I actually know a lot of ppl from GT who got interviews for trading roles from top firms, but basically nobody passes. 

GT is a target school for SWE roles at quant firms though. We send a bunch of SWEs to Two Sigma, Optiver, and Citadel every year. And a few to Jane Street/HRT.

If you’re interested in trading, you could intern at a quant firm as a SWE and then internal transfer to a trading role for full time. For example, I know a guy from GT who interned as a SWE at Jane Street the summer of his junior year, and got a return offer for full time, and then internally transferred to a trading role.

comment,"The Institute has  LOT of latitude in deciding how to deal with you.  As a student, you would be hard pressed to name an area of life that Tech doesn't have an inordinate amount of influence over.

&#x200B;

The reason why they typically give slaps on the wrist is because it is usually the easiest way to deal with such infractions if:

\- no one has gotten hurt

\- no property has been damaged

\- the student is unlikely to re-offend

However, I would advise caution with catching an administrative official (i.e. a bureaucrat) on a bad day or testing their patience.   The only impetus to treat you kindly is that it makes their job easier and requires less paperwork and follow up.    The \*minute\* that fails to be the case they might opt to make things more difficult for you.    If you don't have family with deep pockets who make donations or other connections that you could bring to bear then I would tread very carefully.

&#x200B;

One of the hard realities of college organizations is that you are expected to find the good crowd yourself because not many student-run organizations have the bandwidth to launch full-fledged formal investigations into all of the bad allegations.

Leetcode get you only through the interview, it doesn't really help you develop skills to actually solve an issue on a big project.

comment,"You are right that the class isn't meant to teach you how to design a robot. The main goal of the class, though, is to teach you about a good, thorough design process. You start with a customer and manufacturing based design approach and then work your way through design stages with the path forward based on results from testing. Although while I was taking it, I did not view the lecture as valuable. I thought the most important part was winning the competition with a good design. Looking back on it as a senior, I can see the most important part were the lectures and working on a team with other engineers to create results driven solutions. The hours were long, sure, but you got to share the time with other engineers with (hopefully) the same passion for engineering that you have. I'd say it was a great experience for me even though everything fell apart during the competition.",Positive,"design, engineering",6,2023-04-09

 >A cascarón (plural cascarones, without accent mark; from Spanish cascarón, ""eggshell"", the augmentative form of cáscara, ""shell"") is a hollowed-out chicken egg filled with confetti or small toys. Cascarones are common throughout Mexico and are similar to the Easter eggs popular in many other countries.

We talk about once a week about what has happened and my therapist is able to calm down my paranoia and anxiety about a lot of different things in my daily life.

Now if you have C-PTSD and you're looking for a serious therapist to talk through your trauma with, I'm not sure this is the best option, but this is the best immediate option.

What makes you think the same thing doesn't happen there or other places?",Positive,education,4,2023-04-10
comment,"UPDATE:

Thank you all for the comments, makes me feel better about the situation. Anyways here is the update.

The individuals were identified and its confirmed that they aren't enrolled at Tech, nor are they from in-state. They traveled to Atlanta from out of state for some convention and had time before their return trip so that was when they decided to come to campus to do the pranks. Its also confirmed that they also went to other classrooms to do the same thing, which confirms the other cases some of y'all mentioned in the comments. Charges are being pursued with the intention to warn them to not do this again.

Kinda do feel bad about them being pressed charges, but with there being five of them plus the teacher making it clear to stop, and they also did it in other lectures, from a perspective I think it is deserved. Still, makes part of me hope the charges are not as severe and that really in the end they just learn their lesson and not do it again. Especially during this time with all the violence and political drama, this sort of prank is just not worth doing since it has the potential to do damage. I understand that theres a time for being funny, and that this sort of thing might have be more acceptable and maybe funny in a different time period, but the timing was not good at all, and that they should have thought about it twice instead of making the situation into a headache for all of us.",Negative,campus prank,1,2023-04-10

comment,"I transferred from UNC Charlotte. They had no separation of time tickets and their websites never went down (that said, they also used Ellucian, so they looked just as crappy). But they had a separate additional system like GT-scheduler that was developed by university and integrated with registration that allowed you to bypass Ellucian. I think it was something like Registration Wizard or Class Wizard. It looked modern and had a good UX. 

Registration events typically lasted for months bc they didn't have 2 stages of registration. Somehow, this didn't prevent people from getting into classes: on contrary, it was never an issue at all.

I work for a top tech company and manage services with 99.99% uptime.  That’s 52 minutes a year we are contractually allowed to be unavailable.  Some services are even 99.999% available, with only 310 seconds per year of downtime.  A few minutes of downtime during a traffic spike can be multiple millions of lost revenue, so it makes sense.

How do we do it?  We hire good people and follow best practices, that’s it.  The fact that OIT has taken over 6 hours to resolve the SSO issue is a big indicator for OIT

1. Not having enough people
2. Having the wrong people
3. Not following best practices (see 2)

comment,"Yes, but the buses are actually reliable to get from place to place. No sitting around for 30 minutes to see if maybe the bus will show up. At least their buses consistently have their tracking on and set to the correct route so you can know what is going on. 

They made an exception because her dorm was mostly graduating seniors, and they were going to designate it for the next round of freshmen. It's a complex situation, and Housing realized that a blanket policy doesn't work for those things and adjusted. She was a junior and about to get screwed out of the room she'd been in for 3 years because of a change in dorm designation. The freshmen still had places to go, but there's no reason for her to have to move across campus when she selected that dorm specifically because it was close to her classes. I think that's a reasonable exception to make, since the next year she was leaving anyway so freshmen could get that spot. Why do freshmen need that specific room so bad? What's wrong with letting an upperclassman who's been at the school for years keep their room? It's not reducing the number of freshmen that can live on campus, they're just not screwing her out of a room when she was able to stay same for years before that. 

Tech kicked everyone out of Eighth Street S/E last year for honors kids, so I know how shitty it feels for Housing to screw you out of the dorm you picked specifically and then not communicate on if you even get to at the very least register early to get a comparable dorm. At least UGA is willing to work with their students at all.

I was in the very first class he did specification grading and that grading scheme is soooo much less stressful. There were some bumps along the way since it was the first time he did it.

There's a big CS career fair at the beginning of every semester, although UIUC probably has this too.

The message below from the Office of Information Technology has gone out to campus this evening, April 11. Please note that course registration will now open April 17.

Like, I've never met a cat that would be cool with getting boxed up, taken to an unfamiliar public place, and getting pet by random people. The best case scenario is that cats scratch the shit out of everyone and run away to join the feral cat colony. Worst case they're reduced to quivering terrified lumps and are afraid of people forever.

comment,"Sounded pretty reasonable until the part where they want you to convince a club to test out your recruitment solution and collect feedback. One week is way too short of a time frame for that. My student org spends 3-4 weeks per semester on recruitment and I know many that spend much longer. I proposed a new recruitment plan to my org last semester and it took weeks of planning on my part before I pitched it, and even then my org decided against trying it out. I was a VP at the time, so I’m not sure how you’re expected to make this work as someone who isn’t even a member of the club. 

Not to mention, it’s the end of the semester. Most orgs really focus on recruitment at the start of the semester, so even if they are working on recruitment now it’s in preparation for the upcoming fall, not the two weeks we have left. 

If someone reached out to me to interview about my org’s recruitment process to identify problems and propose solutions, I would be more than happy to make time for that and that would be a perfectly decent GT 2000 assignment. Asking orgs to implement that, especially this late in the semester, is a bit impossible.

Unfortunately, the P=nP problem that is course scheduling is just universally and intractably difficult. students experience it through an individualized lens - rightly so. The flipside is the university has to work with an enormous number of constraints and inherent difficulties that are likely to make *at minimum* a certain percentage of students unhappy with the result.

I never received any emails, but I just checked my admission portal and saw that there was a new link for the FASET orientation. However, there was only one option listed for May 11th. I'm not sure if this is because all the dates really filled up that quickly or if there are more to come. I was also hoping I could do the virtual orientation, but that didn't seem to be an option. I went ahead and signed up for it anyway, just in case it would be my only opportunity. I guess my question would be: do I have any hope of getting into the classes I need if I register that late?

This is a story old as time with institutions and their PR. They only care about how they look and part of it is having a rhetoric about how much do they care about all things and their people (we are family), but at the end they can be cutthroat. 

In academic institutions they are also a success black hole. All the success of alumni and faculty is used to promote it more, but the externalities don't belong to the image of the institution. Things like burn down students, alumni that don't make it, grad students living on a very low salary for many years don't make it to the .edu front-page. Success always goes in in praise and $$$, anything else does not belong to the university.

If you make it be prepared to be begged for money, if you don't they will not help you because they are not a charity, they are a school with a research institute on the side you commie.

If they could care about anything else that is not PR they would plan better to be able to house every student at top quality at low cost, but I beg the priority is still ticketing all these parking offenders.

comment,"I was admitted for this summer under the conditional transfer pathway. I've been trying to keep an eye out for when FASET orientation registration opens so that I can register for classes as soon as possible and was under the impression I would receive an email when it did. Today, however, I checked the admission portal and saw that a new link for FASET orientation was available. The only option listed was for May 11th, which is only a few days before the semester starts. I'm not sure whether this is because all the other dates are filled up or if more will be available later. Just in case, though, I signed up for it. Attending orientation and registering for classes this late brings up two main issues for me:

1) I'm a CS major, and I was planning on taking the following courses: CS 1301, CS 2050, and ISYE 3770. I know CS classes tend to fill up very quickly, so I'm worried I won't be able to get into the classes I need.

2) I currently live about 40 minutes away from the GT campus and have been considering moving closer. This decision, however, depends on my schedule. If I can compact it enough so that I only have classes 2 days a week, I wouldn't bother moving. Otherwise, I would want to move closer. With such a late registration, I won't have much time to move if I'm able to compact my schedule, and I wouldn't want to move before knowing for sure what my schedule is.

Does anyone know if any more FASET orientation dates will be available or if there's any way I can register for summer classes sooner as a new transfer student?

“Unlike many of our peer institutions nationally, we are intentionally increasing enrollment,” Clark said. “In fact, between first-year, transfer, and dual enrollment students, Tech will enroll more than 6,000 new undergraduates in 2023.”

Casually bragging about enrolling more undergraduates than ever when just last Fall, and this Spring, have had no where near enough housing for all the current students. Great move.

comment,"It depends on your professor/advisor and the project you select. Your assignments/grades are determined by advisor and some are more lenient than others. It can be up to chance though—we weren’t told who our advisor would be except for those that did faculty-sponsored projects.

If you have a really cool idea for a product and don’t mind putting in the extra work to make it happen, do Create-X. Otherwise if you’re just trying to be done, definitely don’t do Create-X.

Personally, my group’s ME Capstone advisor is Prof. Tinskey, and he’s been a very good advisor for us—as long as we’re clearly making progress and document our product design process and update him, he has not been strict regarding deadlines or having a dozen submissions through the semester with very specific formatting and content guidelines.

If you're looking at six figure debt for MIT vs little to none here, it's not worth it. Even *if* you go into something lucrative, that's a huge shackle that you will carry with you for a decade or more.

Also, the average CS grad here earns north of 100k. I don't know where you got the 87k figure from. If you're chasing FAANG, that's very attainable from here. The salary may be a little lower than MIT because they are more likely to stay in the northeast, which has higher salaries in general. I really don't think the ""lifetime earnings"" argument that they are pushing in /r/mit is very sound given you want to get into FAANG.

comment,"I think you should consider MIT at least a bit more strongly than other commenters here suggest. As others have said both schools have great career opportunities and open up many of the same doors. IMO there are still plenty of doors that GT won't easily open compared to MIT - I would guess the *mean* first year compensation at MIT is substantially higher than GT's to the point where the debt could be worth it. But more broadly, I think there are many ""soft"" pros to attending to MIT. If you are making 150k+ straight out of school your experience with student loan debt will be extremely different from the average college student and you likely won't ever feel significant financial stress from it. I think beyond plain ROI it's still important to be a bit selfish and think about where you'd enjoy attending school more.

That's not to say the right answer is MIT (hope it didn't come off that way!), you should talk to students and try to get a feel for things like culture/classes/campus at each school and think about what's important to you",Positive,"education, career, student loans, financial stress, selfishness, roi, culture, classes, campus.",15,2023-04-13

comment,"Go to MIT and don’t look back. 

I understand your fixation on the cost difference and applaud you for being financially responsible. But in this case, there’s tangible value to the debt. 

There’s also an element of uncertainty that has to be acknowledged, and nobody seems to be acknowledging it — there will be multiple mid-degree opportunities for additional scholarships/funding, and likely **far** more of those at MIT than at Tech. GT is strapped for cash as a public institution, and you’ll see that in a lot of ways, big and small — for example, at MIT, even undergraduate research pays minimum 15/hr, and even freshmen get easy access to paid research via the UROP program. At GT, most professors won’t want to pay you, even as an upperclassman: you’d need a PURA, which caps out at $1500 for a semester. At MIT there are more scholarships for fully funded exchange / study abroad programs; at GT, count yourself lucky if the OIE office gives you $2k to offset your flight. Etc etc. 

Ultimately, my point is that the cost difference between the two schools upon enrollment is absolutely not guaranteed to be the same cost difference between them upon graduation, and it’s tiring to see these comparisons be made over and over with that false underlying assumption. The potential for landing additional, mid-degree funding up there is astronomically higher.

Your employability and general safety net in life will also be higher as an MIT graduate — the MIT brand is strong anywhere in the world, in any field, and the same cannot be said for Tech. What happens if you branch out of CS? If you have any humanities-related interests you’d want to explore by dual enrolling at Harvard? Not everything in life is about the tech industry. 

But even then, for certain opportunities (think early-stage startups), being an MIT graduate can be enough to land you an interview, while GT may not have the same effect. Which also introduces a scary possibility: if you underperform academically at Tech (a real possibility no matter how talented you are) you’ve missed out on the employability “protection” that the MIT brand name would’ve given you. Yes, many of GT’s top CS grads start out at FAANG, but I would not be surprised if there were far more **low GPA** GT grads struggling to find a job than low GPA MIT grads in the same situation. The overwhelming majority of people I met at Tech who graduate with low GPAs tank their grades in the first half of their degree; at MIT, you’ll get pass/fail protection at the beginning to focus on the adjustment. 

I insist that you go to MIT and make it work. Prioritize paid research opportunities, get a high-paying internship your first summer if you need to. The average GT grad is far from guaranteed to be able to go to MIT for grad school, and MIT offers you a lifelong career boost, so the smart thing to do is to see this as a one-time deal, take it, and make it work.",Positive,"education, financial responsibility, employability, opportunities, brand recognition, gpa",21,2023-04-14

Hey everyone! I was admitted to Georgia Tech EA1. I had taken Georgia Tech 1301 as a distance computer science course for dual enrollment. During my first semester of senior year, I honestly did not do as well as I wanted and ended up with a C in the class. I’m planning on entering GT as a business major on a pre law track (not sure if this is relevant lol) but was wondering if anyone knew if the school would let me retake the class. I know they have “Freshman Forgivness” but I definitely do not want to go into Tech with a C starting off. I had also gotten a B on a UNG Intro to Criminal Law course and was wondering if they would show up on my college transcript as well. I know this does not reflect well on my performance but I am terrified of having messed up my college GPA before even stepping foot on the campus.",Neutral,"college admissions, georgia tech, retaking courses, grades, college gpa",2,2023-04-14

While I live in Georgia and am close with multiple people who currently attend Georgia Tech, I have also visited the MIT campus and struck up a friendship with a few undergrads who currently attend the institution. While I was unable to view any of the lectures, I generally liked the experience I had interacting with students on the MIT campus more; however, my experience with 10-15ish people on a sunny day in Boston is likely not representative of the approx. 4k students of the undergraduate class, furthermore, the trip I took to GT was on a more rainy day so I interacted with fewer people on the tour my friend provided for me. 

Now on the topic of mean first-year compensation, it has been hard for me to quantify considering the varying costs of living associated with the locations the schools reside in. Based on the metrics provided by [www.collegesimply.com](https://www.collegesimply.com) I am seeing about 85k starting from GT and about 118k starting from MIT.

comment,"Hello /u/New_Comb_9911,

It looks like you might be a prospective new student here at GT. If so, welcome to /r/gatech! Around admission season, we get a huge influx of very common and repeated questions from new students. Usually we pin a Q&A thread for all prospective student questions. Check for this megathread on the subreddit homepage. We also recommend that you try [searching google and the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/cd4gcw) for the answer to your question first. 

If you believe this is a mistake, or you think your post is truly worthy of its own dedicated post, then you can [message the moderators to approve your post](https://www\.reddit\.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgatech&subject=About my removed submission&message=I'm writing to you about my submission: /r/gatech/comments/12mxf8b/deciding_between_gt_cs_and_ucla_cs/. %0D%0DI think my submission should be approved because\:).

comment,"Yes, you'll have the opportunities to earn large amounts of money and pay the student loans back.   (but you'll get that at GaTech as well, and have a lot less to pay back).  


For a CS graduate (any field of CS), 120k isn't an insurmountable amount of student loans....but I don't think your starting salary from MIT will be 120k a year more than from GT....",Neutral,"opportunities, money, student loans, cs graduate",3,2023-04-15
comment,"You will have a cushy, high paying job if that’s what you want at the end of your time at MIT. Abolish thoughts otherwise. You just may find though that money truly isn’t everything after receiving your education. You may turn into a pay your debts and do something truly meaningful type person. I see that a good bit at MIT after filtering out the finance bros and SWEs.",Positive,"job
