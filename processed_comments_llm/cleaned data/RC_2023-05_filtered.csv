comment,"Hi everyone! I'm Sidharta Vadaparty, nice to meet you!  
 

I am a senior in CS for Georgia Tech, graduating this Spring and going for Masters in the Fall. I would like to sublease my room from May 12th to August 12th this summer.

The room is available to any one of any gender, LGBTQIA+ friendly. It is a 1B/1B of a 2B/2B unit, and my current roommate will be in the second of the two bedrooms. He is a fellow CS Georgia Tech student. He currently is in a remote internship. He loves music, film, and cooking!

The apartment is fully furnished, and comes with WiFi, utilities, laundry machine unit, and AC.

In addition, the apartment has a kitchen with a stove, oven, sink, and fridge/freezer unit. 

The monthly rent is $1100.

The apartment is 0.75 miles from the Midtown Publix, 0.8 miles from a Target on 18th Street NW, and is 1.6 miles away from Centennial Park (\~13 minutes by bike). All of the Georgia Tech Campus is within reasonable walking distance (only a few blocks away from the apartment).

If you are interested, please DM me to discuss further!

1. Getting the Interview
2. Passing the Interview

If you aren't getting the interview, either fraud/improve your resume.

He also changed his grad date to junior standing cause of AP credits. 

If you aren't passing the interview, it's skill issue. I don't know what types of internships you're applying for, but for SWE interview, it's just leetcode and some bullshit behavioural.

Before an interview take some breaths, tell yourself if you screw up it's not the end of the world. Handle the coding, and tell your interviewer what you really liked about the interview. Ask them good questions.

comment,"I'll add to this from a different context. A few points:

1. Approach any interview as a two-way street - you're not only detailing your skills and what you bring to the company, but think about interviewing the company as well - making sure you're asking the questions to help you uncover if this will be a place you can call 'home' for a few years. Taking this approach can help alleviate the nerves you may feel when you're desperate to land that gig. 
2. If at all possible, throughout your career, never leave a job until you have your next one lined up. There's a certain amount of confidence that comes through in your demeanor when you're interviewing, when you realize that you don't HAVE to have that next job. Sure you may want it and are desperately looking to leave the hell-hole that is your current role/company, but knowing you have a way to pay the bills if you don't nail that interview does wonders to your nerves and composure.

Take more accountability for your learning if a professor isn't catering to your learning style - you also pay to have access to the professor's office hours (and they'll probably do appointments if you ask), TA's, a tutoring center, maybe PLUS sessions, AND colleagues (other students) going through the same classes - who are probably smarter than you.

comment,"I didn't say ""all"" because I haven't taken every single professor ever, but I'm going to say that ALL of them have demonstrated proficiency in English to get to this point. These people publish papers and went through interviews to get these jobs. They live in America. Is their English always perfect? Probably not! They're human beings and every human being alive has problems communicating no matter what language they speak. There are plenty of ""fluent"" native English-speakers who were born and raised in America and are still terrible at communicating - you go to a school that is notorious for students like this 🙄 

Academic bootlicker 💀💀💀 You don't just sound dumb, you might actually be dumb. Your attitude would probably make sense at a private school; alas, this is a public school. You're paying for a public school with all of the politics and inefficiencies that public institutions have. If you want top-tier then you should go to a private school where you really do pay for everything and your complaints might actually make sense. I'm also in A Lot of debt for school, have to work while attending class, pay a lot of money relative to my income - and I still think you sound entitled. You're right that there is a problem, but your professors' accents are hardly what's actually wrong with this school (or any school).

But hey, maybe you're right! Maybe they should just fire all of the instructors with non-standard accents and make all the students who need those classes to graduate wait however long it takes until they find the perfect All-American professor. Maybe they should actually shut the whole school down while they find the ""perfect"" professor for every course! Then you'd really save your money. 

Also, GT has made it clear from the moment you enroll that they expect you to need help outside of lecture. You think it makes you a bootlicker if you listen to the institute's advice about how they intend for you to succeed in your education?

comment,"GT biology major in their graduating semester of undergrad who will be starting her phd in biochemistry/chemistry at GT this summer! I think I can answer all of your questions.

1. I want to address how much you are comparing yourself to others. This only drags you down and makes it so much harder to truly enjoy your subject. I get it. I'm graduating with barely a 3.0 and have definitely experienced my share of imposter syndrome and burnout. As silly as it sounds, everyone is on their own path and everyone is struggling in their own ways. People might find the classes you struggle with to be easy, and that is ok <3 You are not dumb. Take advantage of the resources and learn to love the learning process. It took a while for me to truly get this in my head. It really REALLY helped to actually get involved with research and realize that research is not about how well you test but how hard you work and how curious you are. Validation from my research mentors also really made me see that no one was valuing me for my grades but instead how interested I was in the research itself.
2. Mental health is hard. It is ok for your gpa to drop. Mine finally stopped dropping when I stopped caring more about grades than my health. I joined (nonacademic) clubs and got myself a fulfilling social life. That did wonders for my overall attitude towards school.
3. I got into grad school with barely a 3.0 because I did undergrad research and have a great relationship with my undergrad PI (as well as a few other professors in the chem department here). My PI was very open to me staying in his lab for grad school and pushed for my application to be accepted. Again, super cliche, but pursue what you love and things will work out for you. Passion and genuine curiosity very much out weigh grades. Sure, a good gpa increases your options, but sometimes a good gpa is not possible. That will not be the end of the world. You got this <3

comment,"I'm in grad AE. I know a lot of other AE grad students that haven't taken AE as an undergrad. I did mechanical engineering in my undergrad. Some of my fellow AE grad students have only done Biomedical, Computer Science, Physics, and more. They haven't taken any AE courses or related courses at all and in fact, the first semester was probably their first time taking any type of ME/AE course. For these students though, I imagine the content might be a bit difficult to grasp at first. I know I've seen a few professors who are actually looking for students with strong skills I'm computational methods, which they don't really teach to AE undergrads here or elsewhere. You'll probably just have to take the intro courses on fluids if you join the AE program. The requirements to graduate are really student dependent. There's no specific classes you need to take, just the amount of classes. But you want those classes to be useful for you and not a waste of time.

The general requirement is like 4 AE classes, 2 math classes, a seminar class, and a bunch of electives you choose to take in whichever college you want. If you look up the GT AE graduate student handbook, there's a lot of good information there.

comment,"I just interviewed a few prospective interns at the startup I intern for, and I 1000% agree that focusing too hard on having perfect answers or letting your nerves get the best of you will make the interview process challenging for everyone. Relax, relax, relax - getting the interview means we're already interested! Now we need to get to know you :)

We didn't interview for a SWE position or anything like that, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt please! But I hope it helps to hear some of what the other side could be thinking as they interview you, especially if you end up choosing a startup.

It was pretty easy to assess whether someone had the technical skills we wanted, so we were really focused on higher level judgements we could make about the person, such as whether they had a growth mindset or could talk about their past experiences with wisdom or insight (aka critical thinking skills). 

e.g. ""the project was successful, but it was most rewarding to have grown more confident in my coding abilities, which helped me in later projects...""
""it was incredible to know that the project had this specific impact on the operations of the business...""
""the experience taught me about my own leadership style, and as a result, I have been working to improve xyz...""

...etc etc! Not real answers but the idea is hopefully there.


I was really interested in learning about how each candidate solved problems or thought about the world - when you don't know how to start or continue with a project, what do you do? What have you done in the past? Are you collaborative, and do you know how to ask for help? Obviously I asked more open-ended questions to get them to talk about these themes, but I hope you get the idea. There wasn't a specific answer I was looking for; I just wanted to know what they were like.

My interview partner and I agreed that we weren't looking for someone who came off as a people pleaser - the interview was the first communication we had, so we wanted the candidates to present the version of themself that would show up to work as our colleague everyday, not a polished version trying to fake it just to get the job, you know? Unfortunately it is pretty apparent when people are being inauthentic, so my honest advice is to sincerely think about what you value, and use your core values to guide your interview responses. The candidates we ended up choosing were the ones who were the most comfortable and sincere in their responses. They had personal motivations outside of money, or a sense of greater purpose/passion that was conveyed through their responses and behavior. I picked one candidate because I trusted that their curiosity and respectfulness during the interview would translate to their everyday behavior at work. 

Their demeanor outside of what they said was pretty important, too. One candidate looked away from the camera/screen frequently, and didn't seem very excited about or inspired by anything that was said. While I'm sure they might have been nervous or just in the habit of looking across the room while they spoke, it was not a very engaging conversation even though we were talking about experiences that should have been meaningful for them. It made us feel disconnected from them socially. In isolation we would have been willing to overlook it, but in comparison to the candidates who made the effort to look and sound engaged with their body language, it was a pretty important deciding factor. 

Again, my perspective is shaped by being in a start-up, so this is probably completely different for say, a larger FAANG-level company. Start-ups are a great opportunity to grow as a leader and gain personal life experience that will make your future jobs easier to apply for and transition into. If you end up with one, use that opportunity to grow as a person! Figure out what motivates you outside of money or status, and let that confidence carry you through your career. 

I know it's cheesy, but it really is true when they say rejection is just redirection. They probably weren't the right fit for you either - that's okay!  You are valuable and deserve to be in a work environment where you feel respected and fulfilled. 

You'll end up where you need to be. Be proud of the things you've done and who you've become, and be sure to celebrate when you land your first offer! Best of luck 💖",Positive,job interview advice,3,2023-05-02

I'd say try to get an internship before graduation to diversify your experience and have more items on your CV. However, if you think you may get to publish or co-author a paper with Goldman, then that'd be tremendous. Generally, publications trump absolutely everything else during admissions. That said, if you're planning to stay at Tech, then it doesn't really matter as long as you get a very good recommendation from Goldman and make a good impression on other professors.

Also, if you're considering working for some time before getting a PhD, I'd recommend looking into getting a postbac at a national lab. They pay relatively well (as compared to PhD stipends), you'll be working in a lab, and they often have funding opportunities when you transition to PhD (with stipulations of completing your postdoc there).

comment,"As I've mentioned elsewhere, this is my tenth class in 6 semesters.

I don't expect to be treated like a golden child. I'm also a distance learning student so I have always had reasonable accomodations like having 48 hours to take an exam or same day if it's online. He asked for these to be proctored so I needed to find a proctor open late enough and then go in to take it. It's also understandable if those quizzes are on the syllabus, but they weren't. I'd also be understanding if they were on honorlock or some other service so I could take them as soon as I had 40 minutes, but I had to coordinate a proctor which is a grade A pain in the ass.


The bigger part of the problem with the honor code situation isn't that he caught the people who messed up, he basically made it impossible to gain an understanding of the material by discussing the assignment with other students. That would be fine if you could ask him for help.

And you are right about the low GPA. Any other class I've had where the class was struggling, the professor would take notice of it and ask what they or the TA could do to help. He didn't. Asking him for help was like hitting golf balls into the ocean, you probably weren't getting any support. The TA didn't know the material. Neither the TA nor professor held office hours for online students that were easily accessible. Asking for additional material that you could reference was always denied.

I'm not saying the professor should have held my hand, but I expect him to at least give me the answers to the homework or quizzes so I could reference them and learn from them. I also expect practice problems or supplemental material that you can use as a life raft if the lecture slides aren't working or making sense. 

I think I aced my last test today so I'm praying for the best. Based on what I've heard from the other students, I needed to get a low grade on it to pass.

I want to add one more thing. It's unacceptable to me that my program decides to continue letting this professor teach this course.

I’m not actually in the physics department, but my undergrad major was in physics. I graduated with a 3.3 from undergrad and getting that degree was one of the toughest periods in my life for my mental health.

The GPA for grad school will depend a lot on where you apply and the program. Please also understand you don’t have to go to a physics program. There are many research topics, fields, and programs that use physics and are happy to take physics majors. Also, its generally considered bad to stay in the same school for both undergrad and grad. There are exceptions to this, but you’ll get less diversity of thought and perspective in your education if you dont change institutions.

On this note, what part of physics do you like? Physics is broad. You should identify some areas or sub-disciplines you’re interested in, as that will affect the advice you get for both grad school and industry/government jobs. 

Lastly, on the topic of classmates. As a VERY broad generalization (and speaking as one), physics majors can be conceited assholes. IDK what it is, but people who like to boast about how smart they are or minimize the academic struggles of others, tend to go into physics…. Classmates making you feel lesser or sub-par is an indication about THEM not you. When I changed departments for grad school, I stopped experiencing the same effect you describe. YOU ARE NOT DUMB.

Thanks for the response! For context as to why I want to pursue grad school here, I've been moving around and changing countries my entire life (lived in 9 different countries), and now that I'm in the US I kinda fell in love with Atlanta and Georgia Tech (as much as it's torture to be here). It very much reminds me of my home city of Naples, Italy as there are similar stories (the north burning down Atlanta, like in Naples with Regno delle due Sicillie vs the north), and so I'd love to see the South continue to develop and progress.

I recall my physics advisor during faset saying plenty of brilliant undergrads end up going to Harvard/Princeton/MIT/Caltech etc despite how happy they would have been to keep them at tech. I was thinking after that that if I ever do make it to a point where I can apply to a grad school, it most certainly will be gt.

Also I see what you mean about surrounding myself with people who don't put me down, I do have a really good friend in my physics class and I should definitely find more people like them :)) This made me feel better that it wasn't just me and that it's not a problem with me, thank you very much !",Positive,"personal experience, education, friendship, cultural similarities, future goals, supportive environment.",1,2023-05-04

I was accepted as an electrical engineering undergraduate, but I'm considering changing my major to computer engineering or maybe computer science.

Is it still true? cuz the posts were written around 4 years ago. Anyway, I hope to get a job related to chip design for phones and computers. But I'm not entirely sure about it yet, so I was wondering if it would be better for me to major in computer science and do a 'thread' related to chip design stuff since, as I said, it seems like ECE students have a hard time registering for CS courses.

But that's not required and if it's listed at 90% then 89.9% is not 90% so it doesn't strictly meet the cutoff and the prof could give a B.,Neutral,"grading.

comment,"I'm a professor at a different school. 

There is no direct relationship between the percent score and your final letter grade. Some professors list the cutoffs in their syllabus, others keep it more ambiguous. At the end of the year I look at all the grades and create cutoffs based on the distribution. Once I make those cutoffs, I will not push a grade up or down, that would cause too much bias. 

Honestly, just don't worry about it. Your grade is your grade and you may be a lot farther off the cut than you think.","Neutral

In the mid 90s the ChemE department was caught so flat footed by technological advances that in my 2nd year my numerical methods class was still teacing us methods using basic FORTRAN on VAX terminals (this would have been 1996, before the olympics).

I don't think anyone back then except for the old school CS types were still using VAX machines for coursework/productivity.

Granted, they were more or less forced to get their shit together... by 1998 or so we had a PC cluster in the Bunger-Henry building with Matlab, Excel, and Hysys installed on all the machines (and zip drives....remember those? LOL).

The switch from quarters to semesters ended up a bit of a mess because lots of classes didn't have time to combine all the required material into a curriculum for students like me who started under quarters but finished under semesters.

comment,"The only part I remember of my class now was the FORTRAN programming (useful for me as i'd never learned about data types like arrays nor ever used a compiler or a debugger) and the bit about not using too many degrees of freedom to model data.

&#x200B;

They didn't teach us Matlab until we had to use it for project control lab and maybe reactor design (unsure if that was the exact class...i'd have to check my old transcripts).   I wouldn't call it useless.... it gave me enough of a basis of how to use Matlab so that I could easily help a friend complete their community college matlab project... but i've never touched Matlab since.

Giving us access to Hysys was a big benefit, IMO.  The real tragedy was not teaching us advanced/intermediate Excel skills which would 100% have made senior design projects less work to complete.

Pivot tables, v/hlookup functions, indirect, conditional formatting, index, match, countif, etc....    if you haven't learned how to use those then do yourself a favor and become familiar.      If you ever get a job doing lots of computation, then an actual programming language (like Python) or a purpose built program might be more efficient.... but Excel worksheets are great for showing your work and formatting results into documents and reports.",Neutral,"education, programming, software",2,2023-05-05

A lot of students actually learn more during recitation than during lectures. Also there’s a free tutoring system at GT. You can book 1-on-1 sessions with a tutor (a student who got an A in the class during past offerings). If that’s not enough, there are PLUS sessions in which students work together to review course content and study for exams under the supervision of a tutor.

comment,"The sad thing is while this is impressive, it’s definitely not “arguably the most ambitious project ever attempted by GT Students”. 

There are, I bet, thousands of post grad students working on groundbreaking research on topics which would be way more ambitious. 

Meanwhile they’re labeling a milestone in a rocket launch as more ambitious even though launching of rockets a very popular in industry (thanks Mr Musk and Mr Bezos) on top of which GT has a very well endowed AE program where students learn to do this and more impressive stuff as well.

Don’t get me wrong: it’s definitely impressive that they managed to do this as students given that it probably required a lot of funding and knowing the right people to get permits and whatnot. I’m not trying to be cynical in that regard. But it’s like (taking it into the CS/ ECE domain because I’m a bit more familiar) someone fabricating their own 8-but CPU. It’d be amazing that they managed to do it given that normal people don’t have access to the tools required etc to do it in everyday life but we all learned how to do it in our classes. It’s an impressive feat, not ambitious.

Again, good work guys! But maybe be a bit more humble next time? Just having only the second sentence in that caption would’ve made all the difference.

The fact that you're asking ""what happens if I get nailed for this again""  is a pretty bad look, IMO.

Keep in mind that the institute is fully capable of revoking your status as a student for any violation.  They don't have to just give you a zero on the assignment or in the class.

Obviously this will vary by discipline and lab, so I would recommend shopping around to different groups to see if there’s something you’d like.

Of course it depends on the “seriousness” of the academic integrity violation, but they are not going to overlook a prior warning if you get caught again. 

And, speaking as a former international student — I’m also familiar with another international student who was put on academic probation after changing their answer to a test question and requesting a regrade. They got a zero on the test in question, put on disciplinary probation, and warned that any future incidents during the rest of their studies would result in an immediate suspension that would terminate their F-1 status. 

You’re required to be enrolled in a full courseload throughout the fall/spring to be physically present in the US on an F-1 visa, so if you get caught again, you might have to pack your bags and say goodbye to the United States.",Negative,"academic integrity, international student, academic probation, visa",4,2023-05-08

I've just finished my second semester in my lab, and it has been the best experience of my life. I work on interesting projects; I learn about interesting tools, and I talk to awesome people. You could definitely try to find another lab.

The other thing is that what you get out of ugrad research is what you put into it. If your group has paper reading discussions, and you don't participate/read the paper/care, you won't get anything out of it.

The debt ceiling is likely to be raised. I’d love to say they’ll 100% do it but there’s no guarantee with how insane politics has been the last 5+ years. So in this sense I really wouldn’t be very worried about a default, it’s very unlikely to happen. In fact there’s debate that it might even be unconstitutional to default, so whether congress acts or not it’ll probably be ok.

Lastly, if we do default on our debt it won’t matter who you work for. There’s a strong chance it will cause the largest depression in US history, orders of magnitude worse than the Great Depression.

Yes, the debt ceiling and the budget are technically two separate things. But when omnibus spending bills are put together in a traditional manner, the debt ceiling is addressed inside that legislation.

I switched from EE to CompE my second year here, and I’m entering my last year.

It is definitely tough to register for CS classes as a CompE, since there is no priority for CompE majors. However, any CS classes that are absolutely required you should have no trouble registering for (CS1301, 1331, 1332, 2050). 

Once you choose your threads, you’ll have an option of courses, both ECE and CS, that you can take. Although as you mentioned, you’ll likely only be able to register for ECE classes for the reasons you mentioned. Realistically this shouldn’t be too much of a concern until your 3rd or 4th year.

Since you might want to do chip design, you might lean more towards CompE. I think a thread in Computing Hardware and Emerging architectures sounds great for you. Additionally, as a CompE you have the option of taking either 2 CompE threads, 1 CompE thread + 1 CS Thread, or 1 CompE thread + 1 EE thread. The list of threads you can take are listed [here](https://ece.gatech.edu/computer-engineering-degree)
If you do pick a CS thread, you will get priority for the CS classes for that thread. Some CompE threads do have CS classes as options, you don’t get priority for those.

comment,"You should stop taking accutane. It's a poison that doesn't address the root problem. Speaking from experience, and I didn't even take a full course. This is an unconventional take, but try some combination of the following: removing seed oils from diet, more UV exposure, and putting tallow or lanolin on your acne.

https://www.acne.org/forums/4-prescription-acne-medications/363864-my-f19-accutane-telogen-effluvium-journey-pics/paged/3

> I was afraid to use Accutane for the cystic acne I'd had for 5+ years, and said no at first but my dermatologist continued to pressure me to use it, claiming that it was ""safer than long-term antibiotics"" (false). I was also told so many lies about the risks: ""no long-term effects"", except ""very very rare"" (1/10,000) liver damage or night vision loss, and (of course) birth defects. I was told no serious effects happen with a low-dose (lies). My doctor denied all the other possible serious effects, saying they were never proven. With false reassurances, I decided to try at low dose 10mg/day. No bad effects, so I took 20mg/day. Dry skin + lips, but nothing serious. After 5 months, I developed minor/moderate side effects: minor hair shedding, mild ankle pain, and lower mood. I stopped the drug early, but the damage was already done. The serious effects all started 5-6 months AFTER stopping! My body became destroyed overnight: extreme joint damage + clicking/pain in every joints/tendons/ligaments, loss of 75% of my hair, dry eyes, floaters, light sensitivity, headaches, insane chronic fatigue, partial paralysis in extremities, extreme brain fog/memory problems, stiff neck + spine, nerve damage, neuropathy, slow-healing wounds, painfully dry skin. Years later, these effects are all permanent and have only worsened. The discs in my spine are all degenerated and my rheumatologist says I have the spine of a 70-year old. These effects don't run in my family at all and I don't have autoimmune issues or any other diseases. Every doctor I've seen has gaslit me saying it's not accutane, but thousands of people have the same experience as me. The insert doesn't mention that permanent effects can start months or years after stopping the drug. I have extreme disabling pain 24/7 that never goes away. It's so severe that it's difficult to walk short distances or do dishes. Even a low dose of accutane can ruin your life, regardless if you monitor it carefully and have bloodwork. Delayed onset effects can happen months or years after stopping the drug.

> I took Accutane back in 1999 at the age of 15, I’m now 37. During the first course, all I had was super dry skin. My dermatologist wasn’t satisfied with the results so he put me on a second course, which is when all of my problems started. I started having frequent diarrhea and stomach pain, and it took years to figure out that I have chronic inflammation of the ileum, which is where the small and large intestines meet. My symptoms increased over the years to the point where I’m now pretty much stuck in my house because I can be feeling fine one minute and then have severe symptoms the next. If I feel the urge to use the restroom, I have about 15-20 seconds to find a toilet or I won’t be able to hold it and my body will just go without me having any control. I 100% blame this on Accutane because I was in perfect health before I took the drug. I also experience severely dry lips that no moisturizer helps, migraines, fibromyalgia and brain fog that gets so bad at times that I literally think I have early onset Alzheimer’s. Accutane took away my quality of life and should not be allowed to be prescribed to anyone. And after doing research many years ago, I found that Accutane was originally developed as a chemotherapy drug and when they saw that it was clearing up people’s skin, they decided to change it and call it an acne medication. It’s chemotherapy, it will kill not only bad cells but good ones too and the damage is irreparable!!",Negative,"accutane, negative side effects

The general advice a dermatologist will give you: salicylic acid peels, glycolic acid, isotretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, etc. can be horribly damaging and irritating to skin and/or damage your gut.

When working on skincare, ask if yourself if the right conditions are there? Does the degree of polyunsaturated fats in your diet, which are readily absorbed as humans do not hydrogenate fats with the help of bacteria like a cow, affect what types of microbes grow on your face when oil is produced? Does a lack of sunlight allow bad bacteria to grow? etc.

comment,"> Don’t get me wrong: it’s definitely impressive that they managed to do this as students given that it probably required a lot of funding and knowing the right people to get permits and whatnot. I’m not trying to be cynical in that regard. But it’s like (taking it into the CS/ ECE domain because I’m a bit more familiar) someone fabricating their own 8-but CPU. It’d be amazing that they managed to do it given that normal people don’t have access to the tools required etc to do it in everyday life but we all learned how to do it in our classes. It’s an impressive feat, not ambitious.

No university team (at least as far as I know) has successfully launched a liquid fueled rocket to space. I'd say that makes the project/goal rather ambitious, given that it's uncharted territory for university students. I'm sure that learning how to do these kinds of things in courses is very, very different from doing it in the real world at their scale.

That said, I agree that it isn't the most ambitious project ever, but I don't think that it's fair to say that it isn't ambitious.",Neutral,"impressive, students, funding, permits, fabrication, cpu, tools, university, rocket, space, real world, scale, ambitious, fair.",3,2023-05-08

Is Linear Algebra something I should be familiar with prior to taking Aerospace courses at Tech? Should I plan to take Linear Algebra during my freshman year or during Summer 2024?

comment,admission for any college is a mess. I don't think the people working there know what they're doing. I had a similar issue not for this college but a different one where I met all the requirements and got rejected. I asked admission why and they told me I didn't have enough credits. turns out the morons working there didn't account for the classes I was currently taking. with the classes in progress at the time I would've been like 20 credits over the requirements by the time classes started next semester,Negative,college admissions,1,2023-05-09

comment,"I graduated in 2020 and took a job in the Boston area. I'm in Medford now, a few miles from downtown. Some random advice I can think of:


* Driving is ludicrous in this town. The roads are old and laid out seemingly randomly, and drivers are more aggressive than anywhere else in the country. Personally I've grown to love the Masshole driving culture, it feels very efficient, but it is ROUGH when you're starting out. Compared to Atlanta it's a similar amount of traffic volume just with a fucked road layout and drivers who aren't fucking around.


* Public transit is much better than Atlanta, but still crumbling and unreliable. The subway trains in particular are a wreck, to the point where the fed is having to step in and dictate slow zones/maintenance. The commuter rail is doing a bit better if you're looking at options further outside the city. The system is usable, but plan for lots of extra time. Also FYI the silver line is not a real train, it's a bus in a tunnel masquerading as a train. And the green line has like 5 branches which is really confusing at first.


* If you at all want to get out and about the city, avoid living in East Boston. It is geographically isolated from the rest of the city by the harbor, and the main tunnel connecting it to Boston is being closed for maintenance this summer and next summer. The tunnel has a toll which means some Ubers/Uber Eats refuse to cross it. There is a train connection to down town, but concerns from above apply.


* There is a ton of great seafood and Italian food here! Check out the North End for the ""authentic"" Italian section of Boston, but be aware there are a lot of tourist traps there too. Weirdly there is no good pizza in this city, Italian or otherwise.


* The aquarium is way less cool than Atlanta's, but they do have a ton of penguins of you like those.


* If you are going to be driving a moving truck at all, PAY ATTENTION TO BRIDGE HEIGHTS. Particularly on Storrow Drive. This city peels the tops off a lot of U-Hauls.


* Nightlife is pretty mediocre for the most part. This city is asleep by 1am (trains stop running, bars close, nothing else is open). That was similar to Atlanta in my experience but depending on where you're originally from might seem early. You'll probably have the best luck near the universities in Cambridge.


* Highly recommend getting out on the water, there's tons of options: Kayak rentals from Paddle Boston, duck boats, sailing charters, or even a ferry ride. I believe there's ferries to cape cod and Martha's vineyard which are both cool places in the summer.


* New England states are teeny tiny, so you could pop over to some other states like Vermont or Maine on Amtrak if you want to do more exploring. This is the one corner of the country where Amtrak is viable, so take advantage of it!


* If your office is located in Seaport, my condolences lol. That is the hardest place to commute in and out of imo. It is a VERY nice area though (and VERY expensive).

They recently extended the north side of the green line so there's a lot of outdated maps floating around still, including the ones physically posted throughout the system lol. Google Maps with all the transit options enabled is probably your best bet for the most part. Generally though, this is where the different lines will take you:

Blue - runs from downtown to everything east of Boston, including the airport and East Boston. Worth noting that the airport stop is still annoyingly far from the terminal, you will have to take a (free) shuttle.

Orange - suburbs to the north and south

Red - primary line for Cambridge which means lots of students and professionals. Probably the busiest line of all. Also goes pretty far south east of the city, but annoyingly doesn't go through Seaport.

Green - fills a gap between Orange and Red in the north, then branches to cover the entire west side of the city. There are lots of shopping/touristy places along the western part of this line. 

Silver - A partially underground bus that connects the airport to the Seaport and some areas close to downtown.","Neutral

comment,"Chem 1212 Summer Help?? Advice and what do you think?

I am taking classes as a rising second year this summer. To maintain my 4 year plan, I am planning on taking Chem 1212… lecture with Shepler and lab with Santos. I also wanted to take Psyc 1101 with Hughes-Troutman to satisfy another pre-req. Now I am at 7 hours… and btw, both classes are full summer term. Is this a disaster? Should I drop Psyc 1101 and just take 1212? How bad is Chem 1212 in the summer and how much of Chem 1211 knowledge is required to do well? Any advice is appreciated.

Make your choice.  Choose a wonderful gift , God's  love and life, a real purpose - or misery forever.  I will be 70 later this year, and there is no way I would choose walking out my life in that misery, fear and aimless essence with nothing at the end of my life but hell and misery to step into in the next.  Choose life, choose to know God and his purpose  for your life, choose his son, accept his gift to cover your failings and direct your life.

That doesn't mean just looking up a lab that you're interested in, but also taking a look at the professors who work there and their active research projects. Find someone who's doing what you're interested in. Find of the lab has an opening. Some groups send out their open positions at the start of the semester to everyone.

Then I would suggest reading some abstracts of that professors recent publications. You don't need to understand the ins and outs of what they're doing but it gives a better understanding about the problems they're trying to solve. 

You could then meet with the people working in the lab. Meet with the professor/grad students to discuss your interest. Helps if the professor has taught one of your classes: then they are familiar with your knowledge and abilities. Try to highlight that you pick things up fast, are organized, detail oriented and meticulous. It's definitely possible to get research as an undergrad, I did it for 2 years in the ASDL",Neutral,"research, professors, active projects, abstracts, publications, lab, undergrad, discussion, interest.",4,2023-05-14

comment,"From what I've seen, ML is a very broad field. Just wanted to share my thoughts/understanding but feel free to comment:

One way could be that you can work on say ML Infra teams at companies that actually maintain the systems that power model development as a SWE. You can develop an understanding of what it takes to build ML systems that scale (computing resources, optimizations, etc are very important). You can use that experience as a springboard to jump into say ML Engineering roles (ive heard from my network of people internally transferring from SWE role to ML eng role through team changes) where you can work on model development

Alternatively, you can try looking for teams where you can work closely with data scientists, product managers, ML Engineers. This type of environment can allow you to setup coffee chats with the type of people who are in the role you want to get to eventually and can offer valuable advice.

comment,"Of course it’s a possibility. Hundreds of transfer students are accepted every year. There’s plenty of “spaces”, to think of it that way, that are made available every year from students who drop out or transfer out. 

It sounds like you’re looking for reasons not to apply, but this wouldn’t be a great one. No transfer application is guaranteed, and of course it has to be a competitive process, but Tech doesn’t really have a reputation for being unable to accept transfer students due to capacity alone. It’s a matter of them having X slots available and yours being among the best X applications among those received. The only way you know for a fact that you won’t be admitted is if you don’t even try.

Once you are enrolled, yes, there will likely be capacity-related inconveniences (mostly around registration time) that we all had to deal with. You’ll live. But that’s an entirely different issue.","Neutral

comment,"hm, I was confused by your `≠`. If your advisor isn't super helpful, I would ask the BS/MS coordinators, since they know the most

In general, if you have the means it makes sense to get MS out of the way before you start a career. I imagine it is difficult for people to handle full-time job + 1/2 classes a semester, and you miss out on campus stuff. I am not familiar with PhD programs.

I assume you want to do BS/MS either because you think it is easier to get in, or because you want to carry over credits from undergrad.

You could maybe do non-school stuff Fall 23 and finish undergrad in Spring 24, taking as many double-counting classes as you can.

If you want to take classes both semesters, you might be able to get more credits that could count in MS. An extra BS semester won't be wasted if it moves up MS graduation by a semester. However, there are some things to consider:

- How many classes are you planning to double-count using the BS/MS program? You may also be able to single-count some ""fall-through"" courses; that is, 4000-lvl classes that you take in undergrad, ones that don't count towards your BS degree. For example, you could take a class in Fall 23 and then take an equivalent credit to replace it in Spring 24; then try to get your advisor to classify the first one as fall-through, and apply the second one as a double-count through BS/MS. Haven't read the rules recently, but it's worth asking about.

- If you are planning to pursue MS Thesis, that replaces 4/10 of your classes (12/30 credit hours). 6 remaining classes is not a lot, which is good and also bad. I'm in Systems specialization (18 credits have to be chosen from Systems list) and doing Project option (9 credits), so 30-18-9=3 ""free elective"" credit hours. Other specializations may have fewer core / specialization elective requirements (usually 15 credits total), but you are doing Thesis so yeah, *you will only have __0-1 classes__ that will count towards MS __outside your specialization__*. You need to start planning *now* on your MS specialization and what BS courses you can take that will actually count towards it.",Neutral,"graduate studies, academic planning, bs/ms program",2,2023-05-15

comment,"I have had this conservation with several members of the professors here at Tech throughout  in SCI, CoC.. 1331 and 1332 for some reason have been built up in a way to ensure that people who are able to understand the material to a certain extent continue their journey in the field of CS.

comment,"The homework is to help you cement concepts in practice, particularly for those who learn best by doing. IIRC, collaboration is usually allowed on those homeworks (or at least it was in my time), and that coupled with cheating means that the grade you get on those doesn't fully represent whether students actually learned anything. They do let individual students calibrate their own personal confidence in themselves (ex: if you did poorly or had to get help on it, you know what to study more or ask about in office hours).

Tests, however, are designed to determine what you managed to learn and retain, which is why they are weighted so heavily.

Not returning finals means they don't have to create new tests whole-cloth every semester. It's not uncommon for past tests to show up online or in greek life test banks, so they try to keep at least the final from leaking so they can better track how students do across semesters.",Neutral,"homework, collaboration, cheating, grades, confidence, tests, finals, test banks.",2,2023-05-15

Maybe with each data structure / algorithm, you can create a “half page” guide of the entire thing to summarize it after you’ve learned it.

comment,"Hey! I just transferred in under conditional for this semester from Clayton State, so I'll try my best to give you some advice!

From my understanding, it sounds like you're heading into your freshman year. So I'll try to help you from my experience in your shoes.

First off, your major at GSU doesn't matter once you apply - around November, you'll gain access to Tech's application portal where you'll be able to re-apply as a transfer student. It's here where you'll upload a copy of an unofficial transcript, and most importantly - select your major for admission at Tech. At Clayton, I was a CS major - but here, I'm a Computer Engineering major. I think they asked something about my major on the application, but I don't think it was for any other reason but to verify what you've told them. From my understanding - Tech only cares about your GPA, the classes you've taken, and the amount of classes you've taken (minimum of 30 hours *Post-Highschool*).

I do want to note that it's super important to at least enroll in a major that's kind of close to what you want to do for registration purposes at GSU. For example, I'd have to imagine a communications major would have issues getting into higher level math classes. You've got plenty of time before you'll need to restart the admissions process, [but mostly just make sure you've taken these classes and have at least a 3.3 STEM and overall GPA](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major).

Also, reach out to [GSU's REPP/Dual-degree coordinat](https://perimeter.gsu.edu/rep/)[or](https://perimeter.gsu.edu/rep/) for help! They've got special back channels to ask GT's admissions department questions directly! But I'd also recommend that you go ahead and email the undergraduate admissions office just to verify.

I'm here for help if you need it - so please don't hesitate to reach out to me, either by responding here or PM-ing me!

comment,"Off-campus yes, on-campus no. Getting in trouble for it on-campus could put you in a tough spot if you don't have someone else who could keep the cat (such as your parents). You should avoid any course of action that might end with you returning the cat to the shelter - this is very stressful for the cat and Atlanta shelters are always stretched thin. Think about your long-term plans - who keeps the cat for breaks? After graduation? In 10, maybe 15 years?

Litter boxes need regular upkeep (daily or every other day) and sometimes they smell no matter what you do. Sometimes the cat will track litter everywhere (like my silly kitty does), and regular vacuuming and cleaning will be needed. Can you feasibly handle these things in a dorm?

Cats need playtime, exercise and attention - can you guarantee those needs will be met everyday? It's true that they don't need as much floor space as a dog would, but they still have enrichment needs, and vertical space goes a long way for them. Can you guarantee them a safe place to hide or take time alone? 

Also, a LOT of people have cat allergies to varying degrees. All of you would have to be considerate about your guests and people you come into close contact with.

I highly, highly recommend fostering before you try to adopt - the shelter will cover all of the foster cat's expenses, including healthcare, and you and your roommates will have the opportunity to assess whether having a permanent forever cat is still a good idea. I've fostered around 20 cats (not at one time) in the last year at my off-campus apartment, which technically has a pet rental fee, but they have never actually charged me for it. I use Lifeline Animal Services; I typically visit the locations in Chamblee, but they have one nearby (Fulton County Animal Services), and I think they recently opened a new location where the Atlanta Humane Society used to be.",Neutral,"pets, college, dorm life, fostering, cat ownership",3,2023-05-16
comment,"Yes, all REPP courses completed along with around 6 extra classes giving a total of 60 credits. 

The application process can be very luck dependent. What most likely killed my application was not having the unpaid community work. So, I am guessing that the reviewers do not really care about your jobs and would prefer to see more unpaid community work instead. This also means that GPA and credits probably have less of a pull (above the typical transfer average of a 3.7 GPA and 55 credits) than by selling yourself by your community service. 

You could still get in, but I would not put full faith into it due to the holistic review process being uncertain. I was mistakenly led to believe that being in REPP, in-state, working 30 hours per week, and on top of my above average GPA and credit hours would get me in.

But if you find yourself reading off of your doc like it's a script, then consider bullet points or even pictures to jog your memory so that you speak about it more naturally and authentically.  Practicing your presentation skills would be helpful here if you find it difficult to form your thoughts without a script. 

I know that not everyone finds meaning or purpose in working, but if you can, identifying what makes you passionate can really elevate your confidence and make it less stressful to interview. Someone I know chose their major because they watched a loved one get a prosthetic leg and learn to live with it, and now they are passionate about low-cost medical devices. Maybe you have a story that is true to you and shows the interviewer that you're not just looking for a paycheck, and that you have potential to be a good colleague and asset for the company. 

Maybe another useful exercise is to think about what you would like to see in a candidate - think about group mates and classmates you've had in the past that you thought underperformed, or performed really well. What qualities made them ideal to work with? What made them difficult? You can consider how you embody the qualities that you admire in other people and tailor your responses around that.

You’ll get another 90 days to find a job from the day your work permit is approved. Making it max 150 days total if you time it right and everything goes in your favor. You should probably push them a little and May the odds ever be in your favor!,Positive,"immigration, work permit",1,2023-05-16

We all have our own journeys in college because we all want different things. Are you comparing yourself to people who are aiming to do the exact same things as you when they graduate? If so, don't compare what you're doing in a negative tone. Ask yourself if what you're doing is getting you the relevant skills and experience you need for your particular future. 


Every year, I set personal and professional goals for myself. Every activity, project, and internship I did aimed to accomplish those goals. For example, I noticed that going into my 4th year, my GPA was lower for grad school admissions. My goal was to raise it, so I focused on classes and worked half time for two semesters to meet that.

comment,"I think it's really important and good that you're talking about this. I'll start with the research side of things since that's what I'm most qualified to talk about. The point of undergraduate research is to learn new things and learn what research is all about. As such mistakes are a very natural part of that progress, it's not something you should feel bad about. One of the facets of a lab participating in undergraduate research is to be pedagogical. Unfortunately, your experience will vary wildly as different labs have different perspectives on this. But the most important thing I can say is: 

If you're not enjoying research, it's likely you're not enjoying the people you're working with. 

I hated research and also felt like a failure in my research until I found a group that I fit perfectly in. Every group has different needs, and that includes needing different skillsets from you all. There's nothing wrong with not fitting in with one group, just as there's nothing wrong with not hitting it off with someone. It just wasn't a good fit. 

The first bastion of any conflict is communication. I'd talk with your graduate student about this; grad students have little to no training in being mentors, and are dealing with tremendous stress as well. They may be very supportive but unaware that they're not being supportive, or that the way they're communicating is not effective. If that doesn't work, don't hesitate to find a different group to join that will suit you better. Don't join the first group that accepts - check out a few different groups, get to know their work culture, don't just talk to the professor, try and meet the person who will actually be mentoring you (which is most often not the professor at all). 

As someone else mentioned, setting goals is a good thing to do. Why are you doing undergraduate research in the first place? What do you hope to get out of it? There's not a wrong answer here. If you want to be more competitive for graduate school, then you're going to be aiming to get your name on some publications, attend a poster session or conference, and to stay with the same group for several years to work towards a mature enough project to do those things. If you want to get a better idea of where you want to go next, then you may want to aim to be in two very different groups, definitely an internship in industry or a government lab to see the other side of what folks do. Don't hesitate to change goals later; but having some idea now is helpful. And don't hesitate to share goals with your mentor so they can help you to achieve those. I see more and more freshmen joining labs, and that's fine but unnecessarily fast, especially if you're joining before you have a good reason for doing so. Going into research late in year 2 or 3 with a good idea what you want out of it is more effective than going in too quickly. 

In general, it's normal to feel the need to compare yourself to others. But to me GT isn't best thought of as a race where you're trying to outrun as many people as you can. College is largely a journey to prepare you for the next step in your life; when you get to the metaphorical finish line you want to be ready for the next race, not gassed from this one. GT gives you the tools and resources to do that just fine; you don't have to be the fastest, and you don't have to worry about those who come in with a different set of advantages. There are plenty of opportunities on the other end for all of you that manage to finish. Run the race on your own terms, enjoy the journey, and know that you'll be in good shape for what's next. 

Finally, our old friend Imposter Syndrome. Many of your friends and classmates have it as well; you may be surprised to know many of your professors struggle with it too. Even the ones who are very accomplished. If I knew how to overcome it, I'd do that; but best I can do is live with it, and hopefully offer you some solace in knowing that many of us have it. The worst thing it does it keep you from recognizing how remarkable you really are. You have qualities, and you have gifts. I've said this to many of my students, and I've meant it sincerely. All of you have something to offer, whether its your intellect, or your perseverance, or your leadership, or your resilience. The world needs all those qualities, and gets them in different doses from each of you. It's important to find people/groups/companies that value your strengths, rather than try to shape you to be something you're not. Find those people in your research group, your advisors, and throughout life. Best of luck; if you ever want to reach out and talk more I'm happy to do that.",Positive,"undergraduate research, mentoring, goals, imposter syndrome, self-worth, college journey",7,2023-05-17

comment,"Hey, I completely empathize. Last year, I was a freshman who came in with 5 credits (no research!). The entire year, I felt alone and isolated. I didn’t do that bad grade wise, but I did feel as if the amount I was struggling with was nothing compared to what other people were doing. I met someone who already had two years of research under his belt coming in from high school, and I really questioned whether or not I belonged at Tech. It didn’t help either that I got in off the waitlist, where it really felt just like luck that I got in. I wanted to run, and workout, and have fun with friends, but I had made a grand total of 0 real friends and only ever just gamed with my friends back home because I didn’t know what else to do. Seeing everyone have their own friend groups and achieving so much when I felt as if I was at a breaking point with 14 credit hours felt embarrassing. 

But this past year, I’ve done a lot better. I’ve met people that I care about and enjoy spending time with. I juggled the question of “do I study or live a little?” and took the latter route. I’ve been pushing myself to do better with the help of my friends, and I at least want to reassure you that it does get better. If you’re trying your best and putting yourself out there, you’ll find yourself in a better place than this first year. That’s what I did, and I found myself loving my second year so much more than my first. You’re already doing great with your research opportunity (better than me!), just keep it up, and I totally think you’ll get there. I believe in you.

comment,"First year always sucks. My experience is identical to yours, and I even used to be physically sick because of mold and dust in my dorm. I wanted to quit so hard in my first month and a half, but I somehow kept moving the goalposts up until I was done with my first year (""just one more week""). Take it slow, e-mail your professors, and get sleep. Fucking up my sleep schedule by placing my job and my courses above my own health and wellbeing was the worst thing I did. You can't function on 3-4h of sleep a day, and I learned it the hard way when I got sick for a month up to a point where my tonsils became ping pong ball sized and I could only eat yoghurt for about a week (before I actually went to an ENT and got a prescription for steroids). Just please, take care of yourself first and foremost, and reach out to your professors. Your mind can only be as healthy as your body. If you feel physically sick, definitely make an appointment with STAMPS; the mental health part should get better once everything starts working out.

As for classes, you might have signed up for too many classes (or classes that are too hard); you will find a balanced courseload as you spend more time here at Tech, but don't quit just yet. 

Your second year should be miles better. I promise.

It's roughly 14k-15k including summer which imo is a way better deal compared to Nav. Much nicer apartments and way more amenities. Nav is already like 10k for just fall/spring.

comment,"I’d say the B1G is probably the most academically prestigious P5 conference. Seeing as we are a large research institute, are an AAU member, and have strong academics we are probably a good fit for the B1G. Our location in Atlanta expands their footprint into the Southeast which I’d assume is valuable to them. Rumor has it we had an informal invitation to the B1G during the last big round of conference realignments so I wouldn’t be surprised if we land there if the ACC is no longer.  As a fan I wouldn’t really enjoy it due to the geography of it all, but in a world where Oklahoma is in the SEC and USC is in the B1G I guess that’s just the new normal.  
  
As a fan I’d like to see us in the SEC where we’d have a chance to play old rivals and most of our away games would be relatively close. However, I’m not sure we have much to offer the SEC since they already have the state more or less locked down with uga.  
  
In any scenario I don’t see the ACC ceasing to exist. It will probably limp along after the teams with the biggest brands bolt. I’m sure they’ll bolster the ranks with some G5 schools and slowly get demoted to whatever the new second tier of college football becomes. Worst case is GT sticks around and goes down with the ship.

This creates its own host of issues, but it's nothing a little money can't fix lol.

I agree too that the SEC has no real incentive to expand to Tech! Other than adding an another academic focused school, they'll totally be stepping on uga's toes.

Athletics has definitely taken a back seat the last couple of decades. But with that being said, I agree that the next step is totally for Tech to try to find a spot in the B1G or Big 12! 

My ultimate fear would be for Tech to go G5, and just de-prioritize sports by going down to a D3 league or something in a decade or two. I'm really hoping Cabrera/Batt are making the right decisions now!

with that out, go through the departments you’re interested in, go to research( most depts divide it by area) however if you have no idea what you’re interested in just go through the faculty list and read what they do one by one.

comment,">Athletics has definitely taken a back seat the last couple of decades

Maybe, but it would seem that there has been a fundamental shift around college athletics over the last couple of decades and Tech is still trying to square how to balance being MIT Monday-Friday, and Alabama on Saturday. Even then, in the past 20 years Tech sports has played in a final four, college world series, and 2 BCS/NY6 Bowl games. There are only 11 schools that have done the same. Not on that list; Alabama, Georgia, Clemson, FSU, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Oregon, Texas, & USC.

Beyond those accolades, in the past 20 years we've won multiple conference championships in baseball, basketball, football, tennis, golf, etc... And a Tennis national championship.

Not bad for being in the back seat.

The fall off of the football team is the big issue, coupled with relatively poor play from the basketball team, Tech isn't the draw it was just a few short years ago. If these discussion around conference realignment were taking place just 5 or 6 years ago, Tech would have been a much bigger draw. 

So...It's really all Geoff Collins fault.",Negative,"college athletics, conference realignment, tech sports, geoff collins",26,2023-05-18

comment,"The first is just a rumor I’ve heard through the grapevine about him wanting to retire after ‘16, but can kind of be corroborated by the fact that he apparently wasn’t very engaged in practices in ‘17 and ‘18. What made CPJ great is that he was on his shit on game days.

Johnson didn’t need an OC to play calls, and used that as a pitch to get hired. Johnson did complain about underfunding, but more on the defensive side, so I probably made him sound more hypocritical than he really was (though he definitely spoke generally enough to infer he still wanted some funding for other coaching positions)

Problem coming off of Johnson was that not only were we running an oversimplified offense, but our offensive coaching budget was horrifically underfunded. We then proceeded to shoot ourselves in the foot even harder by hiring Geoff Collins, a head coach with a defensive background, and only giving him $400k for an offensive coordinator, when the average in the ACC was $800k.

comment,"GT Athletics money comes pretty much entirely from the money they made previously. There is very little outside institute investment. I'd honestly be in favor of more institute investment since all research/history shows it's directly correlated with increased funding of academic and financial aid programs.

Alabama and Clemson offer full rides to pretty much anyone smart enough to go to a top-30 school much less attend GT. They can do this largely because they have massive alumni donations and outside money due to their incredible success in sports. 

These programs are relatively new, but give it 20-30 years and the amount of really smart people coming from those schools because of the full rides they're giving out will show. Lots of people go to Clemson for basically free and then come to GT or other top schools for grad school.

Look at Cal, UCLA, Stanford, Ivy league, UMich, Duke/UNC, etc. Amazing sports, alumni networks, and academic programs. The only elite schools with objectively bad sports are places like MIT, CMU, and LACs which receive so much outside funding due to a number of obvious factors that GT is very unlikely to benefit from. 

In addition to all these economic reasons, sports are very enjoyable for a large number of people.

2. Trimming the fat in the GT administration makes sense. I won't disagree with you there. Too many people who don't do shit but who delay shit that needs to be done due to bureaucracy.

3. Don't call all student athletes idiots. Plenty of them are incredibly brilliant and they put a shit ton of time into being both an athlete and a student. Chris Bosh was a student athlete who learned to code at Tech, and after he was done in the NBA, he became a big proponent of programming education. These athletes can become leaders and multi-faceted people. Should our academic rigor be lowered to increase recruiting prospects? Hell no. But don't put all student-athletes in a box when you probably don't know the half of a day in their lives or what they've been through to get there.

4. As someone who grew up in Georgia and voted for Bernie in the primary and Biden in the general, I really don't get how Trump plays in here. Not to mention Georgia is a purple state now. Plenty of liberals and conservatives alike love Georgia Tech for academics and athletics. For me, wanting to come to Tech was not just a matter of top 10 CS program, but also inspired by memories of being a kid in the Atlanta area who grew up watching miraculous wins by GT's football team. I'll accept that we suck at sports now, and shouldn't be sacrificing everything academically for trying to revamp it. But the sporting traditions still hold lot of weight (JFK and Nikita Khruschev sang ""Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech' to defuse tensions during negotiations in the Cuban Missile Crisis) and shouldn't be cut or even massively defunded unless we have a really pressing need (which you haven't exercised).

5. It's completely fair to criticize overspending on sports. Some colleges overspend on football training facilities but refuse to improve their libraries (*cough* LSU). But ""we're an engineering school"" is a shitty and lazy argument that will always be shut down. Our first degree was Mechanical Engineering, and we were founded to teach technological skills needed to rebuild the South in the post-Reconstruction era. But nowhere does it say we can't also teach things other than engineering or focus on anything other than engineering for holistic development and, you know, developing better engineers and human beings. That argument completely discredits the achievements Georgia Tech students make in other fields (both academically and extracurricular-wise). Hell, does that mean we cut the College of Business, College of Sciences, College of Design (including the School of Music), and Liberal Arts College? Do we tell the bands and musicians in Home Park to fuck off and only do their CS and Engineering homework? Do we raze Ferst Center for a Robojackets facility? 

6. For what it's worth, I believe most money going into athletics comes from boosters. The academic stuff comes from USG budget as well. Could there be a way to fund athletics better without dipping into the academic or research buckets? Maybe. 

7. I stand by my statement. If anyone is claiming we should completely cut sports or athletics or be JUST an Engineering school without a logical argument other than ""dumb athlete get scholarship to throw ball"", you can transfer to India and go to a high-suicide rate IIT right away.

comment,"I transferred here about 4 years ago as well, recently graduated, and am staying here for a PhD. I do not like Tech as a university. Fees are (or at least used to be) high, it's hard to register for classes you want, they pay little to student workers, parking is expensive and hard to deal with, the support for students who are struggling academically or financially is minimal or non-existent. Granted, this is true for most universities. What made me decide to stay here for a PhD is excellent professors and some of my classmates. I've had so much support from my advisor that I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. There are also a plethora of student-run clubs and organizations that help underprivileged students and make Tech experience fun and diverse.

comment,"It would make sense that PJ would have sold himself as being a HC/OC, and that would help to re-balance the cost of the coaching staff. But I don't believe there is any evidence to support him not needing assistants, or even not caring about his assistance. PJ was vocal about paying his assistance what they deserved and the ADs, both Radakovich and Bobinski, refused to pony up the money. The same was the case with the DC. Every DC was a hire of affordability from the AD down.

Stansbury said that he was blindsided when PJ told him he was going to retire in the fall 2018. Stansbury  asked PJ to coach another season or 2, so they could set up a transition plan, but PJ said he needed a break. If PJ has suggested to Stansbury in 2016 that he wanted to retire, why would Stansbury had said he was blindsided in 2018? 

Over the last couple years of Radakovich tenure, and the entirety of Bobinski's tenure PJ became frustrated with the lack of departmental support, regardless of how hard he pushed for improvements he watch the Tech facilities and coaching support slide from above average in the ACC to virtually dead last. It would not be surprising that when Stansbury was hired in 2016 PJ was hopeful he'd finally get what he needed to stay competitive, when Stansbury failed to act any differently than his predecessors what choice would  PJ have had then?",Neutral,"coaching, support, retirement, transition plan",2,2023-05-19

Stansbury and CPJ had a verbal (and technically, written) agreement to retire in 2020, which is why there weren’t contract renegotiations taking place in 2018. By the time you’re within 2 years of contract expiration, talks start to happen since recruits want to know there won’t be a major coaching change. It is possible Stansbury was blindsided by it, but in the sense that he might have only gotten a few weeks heads up, which wasn’t nearly enough of a heads up given the circumstance.

Basically, you lose the social part of the college experience, which is what is supposed to make the engineering grind worth it during the degree.

Todd Stansbury being fired also plays a huge role in how academics will be going forward since J Batt, our new AD, is coming out of a majorly successful athletic school in Alabama. I think we have a good chance of being back on the uptick rather than another mid team in sports given how things have been shaping up so far.
