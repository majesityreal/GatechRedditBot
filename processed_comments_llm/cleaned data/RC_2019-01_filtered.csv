As a tutor, you attend a biweekly meeting beside the hours you spend tutoring. You get paired up with students who are taking some of the 1000 and 2000 courses. You meet one hour a week and help them understand concepts and their assignments. You can pretty much ask for as many students (hours) as you want. Also, for each course you tutor they will pay you for half an hour a week of prep time for you to look over the material you expect to tutor over.

It’s not the most money in the world, but it is an easy, consistent job. The students who request tutoring are generally well motivated. I tutored for multiple semesters for about 10 students and really enjoyed it. If you have other questions, just ask.

comment,"I wouldn't say 1371 is hell or anything close to it. The programming is kept relatively surface deep, although there is a bit more of a mathematical focus than your typical intro CS course (heavy focus on mathy edge cases). Compared to your major's ""weed-out"" courses (typically in your second year), 1371 isn't bad at all.

The only reason people dislike 1371 (for the most part) is the homework, which is excessive and time-consuming. The HWs are just a huge time sink and too far beyond what an intro CS course for non-CS majors should be. If you have good prior programming experience, it's a pain but relatively doable.

Disclaimer: I'm a CS major and 1371 came very very naturally to me. I know that is not the case for anywhere near everyone, so take my opinions on the course's difficulty with a grain of salt.

I did the search a year ago, here's my take on your situation:

It's gonna be tough.  

Your budget is low for most apartments in midtown and north home park. Think 1200 to 1500 for 1/2 person or 1000-1300 for 3/4 person. 

You can find your rate at 100 Midtown but that place should be avoided unless you can convince the roaches to pay rent. 

Also, your length of stay rules out the best rates for most apartments which are geared towards at least a year but I'm sure you're aware. 

Your best option may be south home park where the rates for house rentals with roommates are quite a bit lower than 1000. 

I would find a sure bet and keep it in your back pocket while you advertise periodically for a sublease on Reddit, GT thrift Facebook, and the ATL apartment search Facebook. 

Check out this sub's history for examples of peoples' ads. With persistence, it can and has worked. 

Best of luck.

It would worry me a little bit that you will have 50 credit hours done but only up to physics 1 and calc 2. Something I encountered in this was that your school is really going to push for you to take the classes required there but might not be at GT so definitely look at the GT catalog for the requirements for civil and plan your schedule according to that. If you are not accepted for fall then you can always try again each semester and you will have a better chance the more credit hours you have.

The final semester of electives exposed me to new things that were interesting to learn. It was enough free time so I could study and bump me into the Highest Honor designator.

He is the head of the NRE department and a really nice guy. My experience in 2110 was that the two tests and the final were straight forward and the homework was simple enough. Additionally, we had to give a presentation on a topic related to the nuclear industry.

One day, my friends and I finally found it's secret location and decided to try to get in. My female friend, who had a fairly athletic build, and I managed to swipe our Buzz cards and get in! No idea how the system is now, but when I was at Tech you would hand an employee your Buzz card and they would scan it to see if you had a valid meal plan, if you did then in you went. So we make it to the buffet area which was filled with tons of different salad greens (only had iceberge and romaine on main campus), a selection of different cheeses (only American, maybe a rare cheddar on main), and tons of other wonderful food options! We sit down and wait for our male friend to join us. Now he was a fairly slender fellow, a dancer and theater person. The staff rejected him at the door telling him he could not dine there. We do not know for sure, but we convenience ourselves that it was because he obviously did not look like an athlete, while my female friend and I were toeing the line (we did get questioning looks when we first arrived).

2) Offer more scholarships to student athletes
3) Offer better facilities for student athletes 

Since 2 and 3 require more money to occur, alumni are more willing to donate money towards those programs since they can see a tangible return on investment (i.e. more wins).

comment,"A solution to that problem is removing the north endzone expansion. When we play teams from farther away (most of the Coastal and non conference other than uga), all it does is spread out our fans because we can’t fill our stadium anyway. When playing teams like Clemson, uga, Miami, and FSU, that entire damn section is opposing fans. 

Removing the north endzone upper deck would cut capacity from 55k to 44k. The only games this past season where we exceeded that home capacity were (surprise) Clemson and Miami, which were 50k and 48k respectively. The uga game is always a sellout at 55k but their fans always pack at least 40% of the stadium, if not more. 

Just based on the less popular games against teams like Bowling Green and Alcorn State, it appears Tech can pull 35k of our own fans reliably to every game. That upticks when we play better teams like Clemson, Miami, etc. 

TL;DR downsizing BDS would concentrate Tech fans together, increase stadium energy, bring fans closer to the field, and eliminate seats that only uga and Clemson fans fill.

comment,"I'll offer some different advice from others. As far as research works, you will likely be working with a PhD candidate or a post-doc. 

&amp;#x200B;

The best way to approach this is to first determine what areas of research you are interested in. If you don't know, it actually may be too early for you to join a lab. Explore research that interests you. I found that I really enjoy tissue engineering after my first couple semesters in BME. It was prosthetics and neuro for my two closest friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I say this for a couple reasons. 1. Professors in your major aren't the best way to find a lab that matches your interest. The tissue engineering lab I joined was led by a mechE professor. 2. Lab work can be extremely fucking boring and repetitive, so if the final results don't excite you, you will burn out quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyways... TL;DR: 

Step 1: Identify a lab putting out research in an area where you immediately thing ""that's cool as fuck"". Resources: 

* [https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/bme-labs](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/bme-labs) (I'm sure there is some ChBE stuff buried in here.)
* Google ""gatech \*professor last name\* lab"" for all the ChBE profs and find their site (ex. [http://jones.chbe.gatech.edu/students/](http://jones.chbe.gatech.edu/students/))
* Google ""gatech \*area of interest\* lab""

Step 2: Once you find a lab that might be something you are interested in, start reading recent published papers and building an understanding of what went in to each paper. This helps confirm your interest and will help with your interview.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 3: Once you have found a couple labs that you think are a good fit. Go to their ""People"" or students page and find out the specific research areas of their PhD candidates and their Postdocs. (Like on the jones lab page I posted above). Find a few you like and make a list.

&amp;#x200B;

Step 4: Rank them and start reaching out one at a time. You will likely get a ""not looking for anyone now"" reply from most. Follow that with an expression of strong interest in their labs work and ask if any of the other lab members are looking for a undergraduate research assistant.

&amp;#x200B;

Why this route? The level of involvement of a Professor in the labs research can vary widely from lab to lab. But generally the students in a lab are like a small family, so they will know if anyone is looking for someone now or soon.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you interview for a role, make sure you are interviewing your future mentor as well. When I found the lab I wanted to join, and I got an interview...I immediately picked up on the fact that she was slightly bitchy. I ignored the thought because I was excited to have a chance to be a part of the lab. So I start working in the lab and BOOM. Turns out she is a full blown asshole. Honestly for the first year this wasn't a huge problem for me. I was learning a lot and that is what I wanted. (I realized later that I learned pretty much everything from other members of the lab and not my actual mentor.) It was after my first year when the honeymoon period with the research disappeared...I realized how bad the situation was. Not going to describe what happened, but there was basically a moment where I realized ""oh shit lol...you actually have no respect for me at all."" I ended up working with another member of the same lab. My ""new"" mentor and I got along much better. He always thanked me for my effort and he took the time to teach me. He was actually the one that helped me the most when my previous mentor was leaving me to drown. Working with him I realized I wasn't a complete idiot, I just wasn't being taught. He took the time to walk me through steps and give me tricks on how to do things. That contrasted significantly with my previous experience, which was basically receiving a printed lab protocol and being told to do it, then being yelled at for fucking it up, then other people in the lab saying ""hey don't take it too hard"" and showing me how to actually do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

-	AP CS (assuming hypothetically that this is why you can opt out) will not prepare you enough for 1332 alone
-	Simpkin is not teaching the course next semester and he’s known to throw in some extra spicy cs stuff (that being said, this doesn’t determine how hard it will be this spring semester)
-	you know at least half (and maybe more) of the semester’s material 

Why you should take 1332:
-	if you know your 1331 material (ex: generics, comparators, hell maybe even linked lists for some reason, etc.) then you’re prepared for 1332
-	I’ve known people who regret not opting out
-	those data structures bad boys are important for cs interviews

It’s not a bad thing to stick with 1331. You will still learn a lot, and if you’re a freshman (kinda assuming you are. Sorry if ya ain’t my dude), I personally think that’s the right call. I don’t know a lot of freshmen who have internships after their first year. 

I think my point is, if you are 110% confident that you can ace any 1331 test thrown at you, then go take 1332. Like I’ve said, 1332 is easier because of 1331’s preparation.

Most importantly, you’ve acknowledged that you will have a hard schedule so you understand the most on how to account for your own mental and physical health. Always take that into consideration.

I’ve been in therapy on/off for a while so I can’t speak to the experience of someone more dedicated, but if nothing else my therapist has been really helpful in just being an unbiased listener for whatever I’m going through at the moment.  It helped me more than I thought to be able to go to someone completely separate from my daily life, who could help me interpret and understand my behavior and emotions.  We never went super in depth into my issues but having a voice of reason/person to bounce my thoughts off of ended up being really valuable to me.  Therapists can also help you a lot with coping strategies when you feel your depression becoming overwhelming - distractions, positive thinking, etc.  It’s not the right approach for everyone and it can take a few tries to find a therapist you click with, but in my experience therapy has had a positive impact for me.  I’ve also had positive experiences with medication and I definitely recommend giving that a try too, but there is a reason psychiatrists and mental health professionals will highly recommend you see a therapist in conjunction with taking medication.  I hope things get better for you soon!

comment,"Dude, I felt like I wasted a lot of time taking 1331. The amount of content in the class is not huge, and the tests are so stupid: a lot of it is some code and it asks will this fail in the compilation step, fail in runtime, or work? I've had to answer questions about Java in interviews before, but I feel like object-oriented concepts (eg ""what is polymorphism"") don't take 16 weeks to learn. Going into 1332 without taking 1331 can be a bit spooky at first with all the generics and the convoluted lectures and you'll lose points for imprecise syntax, but at least you'll be deeper into the interesting CS classes so much sooner.

Take the test, at least, and you'll know what you're getting into. Plus, you could always just chill and take 2340 this semester.

comment,"I don’t think the therapists at GT  would be of much help , my brother a Phd student here at GT passed away last month because of this depression . It was extremely unbelievable and heartbreaking. But as for ur concerned I believe u should seek help asap and visit a counsellor outside the university. Whatever ur reason maybe for depression speak openly without any hesitation to ur counsellor . Talk to ur parents or the one whom u trust the most and m sure the people who care for you will understand cuz ur most valuable to them ,don’t just sit quite or don’t be reserved this will worsen up ur situation. Trust me one’s life is the most precious thing than all these workloads or stress of academics . 
If any negative thought strikes ur mind try to engage yourself in activities or hobbies u love . Be confident of urself no matter how tough ur situation is right now. Someone said ‘Whether the highest highs or lowest lows , there is only one constant in life : this shall too pass ‘

comment,"I tried therapy before eventually visiting Stamps psychiatry. They also recommended both therapy and medication simultaneously. From my previous experience, I didn't think therapy would help, so I elected to take just medication that round. I am so, so glad I tried medication. It got rid of my near constant desire to cry, which helped more than anything. 

So, you can just take medication without therapy. Stamps still encourages me to go to therapy during most of my psychiatry appointments. They recommend both because research indicates a combination of both medication and therapy is more effective against battling depression re-occurrence. Which I agree with. Depression creates thinking patterns that have to be eradicated and addressed with conscious effort and hard work. EFFECTIVE therapy teaches how to do that. If you are very against therapy right now (I very much understand if you are), I recommend reading self-help books specifically for depression like Feeling Good by David Burns.

I cannot guaranteed that things will get better--I know I didn't believe that when I was extremely depressed--but I do hope you believe that things can be different.

comment,"Those two questions - the one that’s your title and the one that’s your body - are very different, IMO. 

“Is Georgia Tech a fun school?” This is pretty impossible to answer, given that I don’t think schools are inherently fun or not fun. It depends on whether you like what you’re studying, whether you find the right group of friends, whether you enjoy your on-campus commitments and so forth. I know people here who’ve had wonderful experiences (I know I have) and people who’ve found themselves very unhappy. You’ll see the same thing play out at any other school. 

That brings us to, “Can I get a good college experience at Georgia Tech?” and the answer there is “almost certainly”. Tech is a big enough school that there’s something going on that you’ll enjoy, no matter what your passions and interests are. The student body is diverse in every way, there are some fantastic, caring faculty members and every company worth its salt recruits here. 

Overall, when it comes to both questions, the real determinant is what your attitude is going in. If your attitude is “Tech isn’t for me and it’s gonna suck” or “I got rejected from [MIT/Caltech/Harvard] and now I’m stuck a at my backup” or the very common “I’ve heard that Tech is impossible and hellish and I’m sure it’ll be the same way for me”, you’ll have a tough time.

comment,"Thanks for letting me know! The response I got was that the Edge's funding comes from a mix of GT Dining and GTAA. I will be meeting with Staci Flores from dining later this week during which time she will be going into more detail regarding how the funding works. If it would help, y'all are free to come and sit in on this meeting and ask Staci questions. After that's over and done with, I'll be posting a thread with the details of our meeting. Send me a PM if you're interested in coming and I'll get you the details on time/location.

Sorry that I can't give you a more specific answer at the moment- I wasn't aware of this change until I got the email as well and have been having trouble getting in contact with anyone besides Staci. 

My hope is that we can take the things that make the Edge so appealing to students and implement it into the other dining halls. I'd like to see the same healthy options available to all students, and I think there's an extremely valid point in that we have many students on campus who aren't student athletes but still have the same needs as our student athletes. 

In the meantime, Staci did say that if there are any specific items you would like to see on the menus elsewhere to let her know (you can text her at 404-931-8560, she is super responsive!) and they may be able to work something out.

I was made aware of this change at the same time as everyone else, so I'm currently trying to get in contact with GT Dining regarding this change. Unfortunately, I'm not sure how much SGA will be able to do with regard to getting the Edge reopened to all students during lunchtime, as it is run by both GT Dining and GTAA. 

Despite this, if there are specific things you or anyone else have seen in the Edge that you would like to see implemented elsewhere, let me or Staci, the district manager, know. Her number is 404-931-8560, and she is extremely receptive to feedback and suggestions from students. 

Looking forward, it would be great if we can bring the other dining halls up to the same standard as the Edge. The big thing I'm seeing is that students like the healthier options and better quality, which are both things that we should be able to improve elsewhere. Staci and I will be sitting down this semester to try to figure out what healthy foods we can get added on campus.

Read the textbook and do problems (this textbook and its problems are good! [http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/book.pdf](http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/book.pdf)) before the lecture! This will help you pay attention in lecture and stay on pace with class. Whatever problems you do, don't look at the answers until you've completed the problems and have an answer. Doing problems on your own is the only way to learn math effectively.

comment,"I have some questions for Risha and food for thought for everyone else:

Why is it unreasonable to expect thorough documentation of mental illness when filing for adapts? You’d have to do the same for any other disability, presumably using your own money to find a doctor that is going to treat and document your problem.

To address a recurring theme in this mental health debate - cost is a determining factor in any sort of healthcare, not just mental health. “They should be able to get the access they need without worrying about money.” That is your opinion on universal healthcare. How is it relevant to Georgia tech? If you develop epilepsy during your time at Georgia tech, you’re going to need to find a neurologist outside of the school that can administer your care. If you have a life long chronic illness, you’re going to have a healthcare team outside of Georgia tech that works with you over time. Should Georgia tech now cover all sorts of medical conditions indefinitely too? Please correct me if this is an inaccurate analogy. 

During the first episode it was said that having an open door policy is an empty gesture. This episode you’re saying you want professors to spend a class telling their students that they have an open door. Two people that are aggressively on the same side of the issue disagree with how it should be dealt with, so doesn’t that show how complicated the matter is? The guests on this series act as if the solution is so simple, we can blame x, y, and z for the problem, and we have a list of demands/easy fixes. That’s just not true. 

Do you realize that the professors come from all over the world? They worked incredibly hard to be here and many came from cultures where competition is something many of us can not even imagine. 
“We didn’t come to Georgia tech to be coddled. We came to be challenged but to a point.” What point is that? Is it not different for every student? How is a professor that may have had to compete with so so many people just to get the opportunity that you were inherently born with supposed to realize where that point lies, and not think of it as coddling? 

I am sorry you feel that you are being too challenged. I’m sure lots of students that go to less rigorous schools feel that way as well. Some students at even more rigorous schools probably feel they aren’t being challenged enough. Everyone handles things differently and there’s nothing wrong with that, but the world can’t cater to the lowest level of ability to deal with things.

comment,"Sitting on transit so I’ll happily take a stab at this while others think on it. I’ll say, for my part, that I’m making every effort to not step on people’s opinions as they talk to me — as you noted, people with very similar situations have vastly different interpretations of what precisely the systemic issue on Tech’s level is (if it even exists) and how precisely to fix it. The breadth of opinions the show will represent is limited only by the number of people who’re willing to talk to me, and there’s a lot more coming; all this to say that if these episodes feel either one-note or contradictory taken on the whole, that whole is going to evolve. People propose solutions (even as simple as “I don’t think X works well, but I’d prefer Y”) by drawing on their own experiences and knowledge bases. Mental health is itself complicated, as is Tech’s resource ecosystem in particular, so my hope is by putting these conversations out there we can all clarify what we KNOW and what we THINK we know collaboratively. 

The thinking with this episode’s point about providing documentation is, if I’m not mistaken, that GT’s culture exacerbates this particular brand of disability in a way that it doesn’t others — say, a physiological disability . Combined with what you correctly say is across-the-board issues with healthcare access, this guest (and lots of other folks I’ve talked to) feels like the challenge  of pursuing these accommodations at Tech is uniquely difficult. 

The literature suggests that mood/anxiety/substance abuse disorders BEGIN in most patients in their early-mid 20s, so for many of us grappling with this Tech’s resources are our first foray into the area at all. For me in particular, having my family based out-of-state is another snarl because my GP and specialists are there, not here. See this paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1925038/

I, for one, don’t need your condolences for feeling “too challenged” (though I appreciate the thought), and I don’t believe either of the amazing girls I’ve talked to do either. Challenges and suffering are not the same and shouldn’t be, and when you have a chemical imbalance in your brain it’s difficult to reliably assess the difficulty of any task in a vacuum. As humans and not robots, the academic knowledge and emotions have to exist within us simultaneously. Bummer, right?

The most recent guest directly says that a problem exists in her professors challenging students too much, past a point that is acceptable. 

I fully understand everyone’s experiences are different, but it seems that on this campus we only really accept one opinion on dealing with the mental health problems on campus. That’s not a dialogue. The whole “if you can’t take the heat” opinion, which to be clear is not what I am saying, seems completely unacceptable to have.

comment,"Apply to all the positions you’re even remotely qualified for on Careerbuzz. It sounds like you already have some good experiences, so as long as your GPA is competitive, it’s really just a numbers game at this point. Network at info sessions, career fairs, etc., see if you can get a referral since those help get your resume seen. 

Speaking of which, make sure your bullets on your resume aren’t just what you did. Your bullets should almost all describe the (ideally, quantifiable) results of your accomplishments at your job. I see a lot of people just list what they did (""Met with stakeholder groups and gathered requirements"", ""Analyzed data to find areas of improvement"", etc.) instead of the value of their work.

Anyone can meet stakeholder groups, gather requirements, and analyze that data. So what? How did that analysis help? ""Improved revenue by 17%"", ""increased viewership by 21%"", ""reduced costs by 34%"", those are the things that recruiters like to see. The ideal bullet in this situation I described would be something like ""Improved company revenue by $12,800 (17%) through stakeholder group meetings and analysis"". You should always start with the result/impact, followed by what you did to achieve that

Regarding your last question- if you were looking to get additional dining dollars this semester then you would need to go in and pay for them. You can do this by getting dining dollars alone or by combining them with meal swipes.

1. Yes, the science fiction collection is still in the library. It is in the science fiction reading room on the first floor. Special collections reading room is there, also. 
2. When the project is complete in 2020 (meaning Price Gilbert finishes renovations), some books will be returning. However, they will be circulating books like popular collections and some curated core materials. The vast majority of the collection is in cold storage at the Library Service Center. We do this so the books are preserved  -- they stay at 55 degrees and 35 percent humidity, which arrests the physical degradation of the material. 
3. Ordering books from the Library Service Center is very easy. You just use the online catalog through the web site. If you order before noon, the books usually arrive the same day.

For a school with as rich an athletics history as GT, it’s sad that the only school we outspend in the ACC is Wake Forest. Not only that, there are only 65 power five conference teams in the NCAA. We rank 61st in funding, bottom 10%. I’m not saying to pour $40M a year into the football team like uga does. But it would be nice if we stopped treating our historically rich athletics like shit.

When I walked across the stage last Spring, before beginning my PhD last Fall, I told him that I'd see him again in 5 years. Sad to hear that won't be happening.

Huge thanks to President Peterson for the time he's given this school, and I hope that whomever takes over the position will be able to fill the very large shoes he's leaving behind. ",Positive,"gratitude, leadership, transition",37,2019-01-07

comment,"That's not how it works. The GTAA has their own independent budget. They don't take any money away from research. 

When the athletic department runs a deficit, they draw down from a trust fund. When there is a profit, the fund grows. Last year, the GTAA ran a $2.9 million deficit. This year, it posted a $2.1 million profit. Next year, they expect to run a $2.8 million deficit again. Then the GTAA projects revenues to exceed expenses in 2020 and beyond. GTAA's target for a healthy fund was $5 million this year, and they achieved that goal. The trust fund currently stands at $5.7 million.

If you want more money for research, write a grant proposal. If GT fans want our athletic department to spend more money, then they need to ensure the GTAA sees an increase in revenues when they look at their future projections.","Neutral

comment,"The problem is that your' numbers are wrong. The GTAA counts the $7,600,000 that they collect as mandatory student fees as revenue if you took out the market distorting subsidy they would run big deficits every year. The current GTAA funding level is already higher than the market is willing to justify. When non athletes already have to take out student loans there is absolutely no justification to force students to pay more student fees to support an athletic department. I find it ridiculous that a student that spends 8 semesters at Tech would pay over $1000 in mandatory fees to support an athletic department. I now GT is not alone in that regard of artificially supporting athletics at unsustainable levels. The bigger problem is the majority of schools like GT try to subsidize athletics to compete with the 25 big schools that turn profits without subsidy's. Schools that don't have the money need to stop trying to keep up with the Jones'.

Which numbers? Nowhere in your comment do you actually dispute any of the numbers I provided. All of my numbers are correct and come straight from the GTAA.

You just provided a completely different number to try to make a different point, which is that student athletic fees are a significant source of GTAA revenues. However, those fees are exclusively designed to support athletics as a part of the overall college experience, so getting rid of the athletic department doesn't put that money towards research. It would simply lower overall costs by a whopping $125 per student per semester.

&gt;The current GTAA funding level is already higher than the market is willing to justify.

comment,"Hi there. From the looks of it, it looks like you're suffering from [Imposter Syndrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQUxL4Jm1Lo), along with a general feeling of inferiority. First off, I'd like to say by making it into Georgia Tech, you are most definitely not the ""least talented"" nor the ""least contributive to society"". You don't have to constantly be offering gifts to others around you in order for your life to have worth, in fact doing so is likely impossible. Everyone tries their best to live their own life, and you are already doing so much and accomplishing so much by trying. You are still learning and growing, and there's no need to feel rushed for your poetry to somehow save the world or save a life. As an avid reader, you are already reading more than the majority of adults, and satisfying authors that just want their words to be read. As someone helping people with emotional and relationship problems, you're being a good friend to others and helping people around you. And that is wonderful.

Georgia Tech tends to bring up a feeling of needing to constantly do more, because like social media, all we typically see is people's accomplishments. So you see that students doing amazing research, you see students getting good grades, and doing whatnot else, but you don't get to see any of the details behind that.

Now, as to your thing about thinking it's too late to go for any of your hobbies, [there are plenty of people who try new hobbies late and find success](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8cwe5j/serious_redditors_who_discovered_and_mastered_a/), and it's never too late to start. The founder of McDonalds was 52 when he decided to start making a business. JK Rowling, at the age of 28, was divorced from a short marriage, just suffered from a miscarriage, and a single mother with no job and no money, when she decided to start writing Harry Potter, which was rejected by all major publishing companies, and only published with 1000 copies when she was 32. There is no deadline, there is no start line that you've missed forever. College is supposed to be a time for you to find yourself and discover what kind of person you are, so there's no reason you can't start a new hobby now.

And honestly, I would see a psychiatrist. I don't want to misdiagnose, but there's a high likelihood that you are clinically depressed, and it's a frequent tendency for depressed people to try to lessen how depressed they are in their own minds, but if there's any ambiguity, just go see a medical professional and go from there.

comment,"I can relate to how you feel, for sure. I always compare myself to others, especially those who are always on top of it. This has really been an issue with me when I came to Georgia Tech, where a lot of people are talented, and it shows. But you have to consider this: there are others out there that might not be as good as they are, maybe it's math, maybe it's science, maybe it's writing. Everyone has a niche they fit in, that's why they are unique. Obviously, there might be people who seem perfect, some people who are good at everything- sports, academics, socialization, etc.  


But the squeaky wheel gets the grease. These people are made known because they show their abilities, but what about the others? I'm certain there are plenty of other people who feel the same as you, but surely they have talents in other fields. You have talents, whether you realize it or not. But also understand that talents aren't everything. You have passions, which is as important as talents, in my opinion at least. You have something you want to do, so why not go for it?   


Like what u/gatechICS83 said, you aren't defined but what you have done and haven't done by whatever age you are. Instead of thinking about what you can do, just do it. Don't be afraid because you think it's ""too late"", because you can always pursue your passions. And believe me, these passions are YOURS. They make you different from other people, the people you look at in awe.   


This might all sound cliche and naive, and hell, take it with a grain of salt.

I am that guy. You know the one who is kiilling it? The crazy dude getting top grades, winning awards every 2 months, writing patents, starting companies. Yep, I'm that guy. I make it look effortless too: it's part of the Halo effect. I get cold emails from people asking for advice.  Doing something awesome that makes people stop and go ""wtf, what a beast"" doesn't even register in my head. I am youngest in my team and outperforming seniors by a 10x margin.

I am the guy you hate. The guy who looks like he has it together. The guy who looks like is ""solving important problems"". And I want to tell you, I have the same feelings . I feel just like you except with different problems Ifeel something is wrong with me and I'm damaged. Sometimes, when days are long and tough, I feel I am undesirable and not worthy of love. I feel I have no artistic talent. Hell, I fucking feel I am a loser and not cool. And I can tell you there are people who will spit at my face if I tell them I think I am a loser. I feel I am taking over space in this world for no reason.

Why am I telling you this? Because the grass always looks greener on the other side. No one has it together, no one.

You would think I am impressive and I would look at a an average dude hanging out with geniune friends  and I would wish I had such genuine friends and wonder what he has that I dont.

When you stop looking at others and look at just your path, it becomes easy. It's simple not easy. I'd be the last person to say it's easy  not to compare to others. I want you to know, though, that you aren't alone. Everyone is going through this.

This statement comes from my experience: 5th year Arch major, landed a part-time job on Tech's canpus with face-to-face talking. Just to illustrate: my ""interview"" was at the Silver Skillet!

Right now, you are a second year: to a company, barely entry-level in skills. They will look you over in favor of more skilled candidates, _if you apply as another candidate_. I.e., online apps. The best way around the competitive online process, if talking with people. GT alumni, specifically.

Use LinkedIn to find an IE company that interests you, or a GT alumn that works in what you want. Tell them you're interested in what they do, and that you can be a __long-term asset via Georgia Tech's Co-op Program__. 

Be confident in that last part: for most companies, interns are a liability - here for 4 months, then gone for good. They want _keepers_ - the coop program is a good way to keep you. 

Wrap up the message with a nice ""thank you"", for sparing you some of their time. Oh, and prepare yourself for disappointment over no-shows; it happens. People dont look over their emails at all hours.

__Tl;dr, people and the Co-op program are your friends. Talk with GT alumni directly via LinkedIn, use the Co-op program as your bargaining chip.__

For your financial concerns, you can look at GT grad salary data here: [https://webapps.gatech.edu/cfcampus/adors/commencement/salary\_report.cfm](https://webapps.gatech.edu/cfcampus/adors/commencement/salary_report.cfm)

I think you will come to the conclusion that GT grads are paid well across a variety of majors, so I wouldn't worry about that.

As for being indecisive, I was sort of in the same boat mostly flipping between CivE and math (I know, very unrelated seemingly). Eventually I just realized that was getting nowhere just stressing about making the absolute ""right"" choice all the time and just decided that these were both probably good choices if I gave both of them such serious consideration. Then I just picked CivE because I already had a little bit of work experience with it.

They then proceeded to paint the entire shitshow as if I was not a resident paying 1.10k for a room the size a wealthy suburban mom's closet. The dust from the makeshift 'construction project' surrounded the room for weeks, and the smell of the industrial-grade carpet-to-concrete adhesive glue smelled of 1800's industrial ass.

comment,"Seriously depends on the professor, and the best sections are restricted to MSE majors. I’ve heard good things about Garmesani. 

I had Sanders and Alamgir and disliked it, mostly because Sanders taught the first half and wasn’t very... inspiring. Alamgir was okay and it probably would have been better if he taught the whole semester, for the sake of continuity. Idk about other professors, but I found the amount of material (ha) covered (we did Ch. 2-10, but I’ve heard others do less) and the lack of opportunities for feedback (nothing but exams) very frustrating. 

Edit: I took it because it’s required for ME",Negative,"professor, mse majors, garmesani, sanders, alamgir, material, feedback, exams, me",5,2019-01-09

I've heard horror stories about this class. I've only had one other class as a BME major that I think even comes close to the workload that I've heard about in that class, and that might be pushing it.

As long as the classes you're in aren't group-based (because if they are, you're not going to want to meet on MWF because you'll be a bit tired out by the end of your day), then you'll probably be fine.

If they are group-based, do your best to have your group meetings on T/Th in the afternoon/evening (or in the morning if you need something to kick you out of bed and be productive on a day without classes). Do not do your group meetings over the weekend, especially with a MWF schedule - it's a waste of weekend days that are better spent on homeworks/assignments often assigned on Friday in those classes.",Neutral,"class, workload, schedule.

Some of these problems, like the endemic fees and textbooks essentially being robbery, are an American thing that you can't really escape anywhere, but issues like our absolute garbage-quality food are specific to Tech. UGA operates under the same school system but manages to have award-winning food that their students love. I don't really know what the disconnect at Tech is that leaves us with cold $11 half-bowls of macaroni, but the shit has gotten steadily worse at every dining hall over the four years I've been here, and the only alternative is cooking for yourself. If you told me as a freshman that a brand new dining hall would be built but somehow end up worse than fucking Woody's I'd never believe you.

As somebody that's never been involved in SGA I can't really tell you how it works, but I also can't really recall any major recent campus-wide improvement that they can claim responsibility for. They fund things, but student activism in the US is more of a social activity and something to put on your resume than anything genuinely having an impact.

Education here is seen as an industry, so at Tech the only concerns the administration takes seriously are getting money from students, getting money from research, and getting money from wealthy alumni. Expect nothing better.",Negative,"education, student life, food, sga, money",114,2019-01-11

Food is more expensive in the US (compared to most countries). As is cost of living. But wages are, too, so it's not like food is a 'ripoff'. And you're wrong about most healthy food, it is more expensive to buy and produce, since there are less preservatives and crap. 

And yes.. our country does not offer free education. But this, again, isn't specific to Tech.

Our dining halls do suck, though. They're expensive, and low quality compared to other schools, even ones in the city. For everything else you mentioned, I'd argue that GT is more transparent with fees than other colleges I've seen, and that many professors are proactive in avoiding textbooks unless necessary (not too many lower-level classes have this option, though).",Neutral,"education, fees, textbooks, food, cost of living, wages, healthy food, preservatives, free education, dining halls, transparency, professors, textbook alternatives.",23,2019-01-11

Our society has turned it into a predatory requirement, when really, for many people, it is wholly unnecessary [what use is a degree in gender studies?]. Big textbook and big education will be paying the price for their greed over the next few decades; with luck, Tech will be exempt from that. 

As for why we put up with it, most of it is transient, and the payoff at the end is well worth it. If you want to find cheap food, that's quite possible out in the country, but the logistical supply chain of getting it into the city, and the high density of city living, necessitates that it be priced higher. In non-agrarian societies, transport of food is the largest cause for mark-ups. As for why the cheapest food is often the least healthy, that's simple; food that isn't healthy tastes good. If people in your home country could sell hamburgers for $1 a piece, I'm certain they would, as it would steal away business from competitors. Plenty of people are suckers for how food tastes vs. how healthy it is; I'm sure people from your home nation are no different – they likely lack access to beef as cheap as ours, meaning they aren't able to live as unhealthily. 

As to where you can get good food for relatively cheap around here, there's a decent Pho place on West Peachtree, Rocky always has decent pizza, and Hankook has amazing tacos for about $3 a piece. ",Neutral,"education, food, society",3,2019-01-11

Sure, once you've been here a year, you can identify which ones you'll get every semester, but freshmen coming in trying to plan their finances don't really have a good way of actually knowing how much school will cost them.

After getting accepted and putting down a deposit, I discovered all these fees and also that my scholarships covered tuition but not fees. I had to decline my acceptance and go elsewhere because I knew I wouldn't be able to afford once I took fees into account.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, after working closely with administration at the school I did attend for undergrad, I learned that many schools use fees as a way to increase money they receive without having to announce a tuition increase, which would cause more negative attention.

I was confounded by students repeatedly asking me if they really have to buy the text book. You may be changing my mind, but I had been teaching class the same way that I took them back when I was in college. We didn't have the internet in the same sense that it exists today, and I think that I gained a lot by carefully reading textbooks over and over and working the homework problems in them. If a student mentions downloading a pdf, I ask them not to tell me that information. But we had to buy them all, and they were a lot back then too. We didn't have tons of options from learning from different sources on YouTube. Probably a lot of professors think that students have it too easy today, but in many ways things have become harder too with regards to the amount of information covered.

People really did struggle with text book prices. I had a friend who would painstakingly photocopy each page before returning the book.

The high costs aren’t exclusive to Tech. It’s common for tuition to be higher for out-of-state students at public universities. That said, Tech grads have high earning potential, so that kind of helps. The FAFSA, the main application for college financial aid in America,  considers family income to determine how much aid one qualifies for.

I only mention this because back as a high school student, I had this delusion that my success in life was a deterministic result of where I ended up college-wise. When I didn't get into the top program for my major, it kinda messed me up for a few months before I actually went to college and figured out what it's like. 

Really, no matter what career you choose - industry or academia or medicine or whatever - there are going to be many more significant junctions and opportunities that will impact your professional life far more than your undergrad alma mater.

The new library consolidated all those areas and moved some departments offsite entirely, and the new design pretty much triples (or more) the student study space.

Also, one of those half-floors isn’t staff space, it’s the graduate student commons. So the staff areas went from taking 80% of the space (3 full floors, 2 half floors, and all office/classroom space on 4 floors) to ONLY 1.5 floors.

2. I know that it's hard for CmpE majors to get CS classes, but I've heard that an alternative is to adopt a CS minor in addition to the major. How does that make it more likely to get those CS classes? I really just want to take 1332 and classes in the SysArch thread.

Sure enough, I didn't, even with a 4.0 GPA in college. I was a little disappointed, but I decided to spend another semester at the community college. I applied again the next semester, which was for a spring semester start. And low and behold:

I got in.

Moral of the story, the first college out of high school doesn't need to be your last. Besides, I didn't' have to pay tuition at tech rates for those first few years.

The reason for this is because from a cost standpoint , you’re going to cost me per hour just to train you. Then, that same person will roughly deduct 10% from whatever team I place him/her on due to questions, screw ups, etc. Your degree is proof that you are capable of learning, your experience proves you’re capable of actually doing the job I’m hiring you to do. If neither the Georgia Tech kid, or the Georgia State kid have worked exactly on the type of project the teams are working on, the company goes with the person they’d rather train 100%. 1000% so for defense contractors who often don’t ask a single technical question.

comment,"Update:

1. Staci wasn't 100% sure about the answer for this one. I've been digging a bit more deeply into NCAA regulations and found this:

### 16.02.3 Extra Benefit

An extra benefit is any special arrangement by an institutional employee or a representative of the institution's athletics interests to provide a student-athlete or the student-athlete's relative or friend a benefit not expressly authorized by NCAA legislation. Receipt of a benefit by student-athletes or their relatives or friends is not a violation of NCAA legislation if it is demonstrated that the same benefit is generally available to the institution's students or their relatives or friends or to a particular segment of the student body (e.g., foreign students, minority students) determined on a basis unrelated to athletics ability.

I'll be getting in contact with some people from GTAA regarding this, given the fact that one of the reasons given for its closure was athlete's ""unique nutritional needs"" needing to be accommodated. This phrase combined with what I have heard from other students leads me to believe that there is reason enough to question whether the same food quality is being served across the board. 

Now, I believe this is only against the rules if the Edge is closed ALL day to non-athletes. If they are closed for lunch and open for dinner or vice versa, I don't believe that breaks the rules (this is how many other schools do it). As of right now, there is no explicit rule saying non-athletes cannot eat at Edge for dinner but the building is locked to all except athletes during dinner hours. Staci and I are working to get this changed, but we haven't been given a timeline for when the doors will be unlocked again.

2. From what I can tell, yes. To what extent? Not sure. 

If I can, I'd like to have someone from auxiliary services or campus services sit down with me and tell me exactly how our dining plan fees are allotted. So far, I haven't found anyone who can tell me exactly how it works. 

For now, I'll be asking Marvin from GTAA about this as well as the NCAA rules question. He should be able to answer the question of exactly how much money from student dining and fees (athletic or other) goes to Edge.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long response, I hope that helps at least a bit for now. If you're interested in sitting down and discussing anything further, I'd be happy to do that.

Even then, *living* space isn’t always the same as *study* space, hence why so many students prefer to work elsewhere. Sometimes your room has distractions, or you just want to get out a bit. 

There are some individual desks in the CULC, but the loudness of the surroundings can vary. They also don’t provide as much table space or privacy as the cubicles did. 

Many people benefit from quiet study space, and at least the 6th and 7th floors provide that. It also helps motivate you when everyone around is studying rather than socializing. On the other hand, people could also be upset because the fate of the cubicle-style space wasn’t publicized. 

If the new library doesn’t include a quiet cubicle floor, a good solution would be to have more desks like the ones that overlooked the computers in the library. They were individual, and although there was a little noise from larger tables nearby and downstairs, the desks themselves didn’t foster communication among people next to each other. Plus, you had plenty of table space without having to share. ","Positive

&gt;No course in processor design, with limited exposure to VHDL

&gt;The networking course is pure theory. I can tell you what the difference between a TCP and UDP packet, but beyond that there isn’t much I can say. For instance, if questioned how to implement TCP with the UDP protocol, I wouldn’t be able to do it easily.

I'm not sure how much of that makes sense to you right now, but essentially there are a lot of desired industry skills that are needed right now (VHDL, drivers, OS, networking) and we don't have exceptional classes in.

comment,"Welcome to America! The best part is if you complain about any of this, most middle-of-the-road citizens will tell you that you're lazy and looking for free handouts.

Seriously, though, America has a very unique culture. For better or for worse (slowly worse, if you've been paying attention), we're extreme individualists in a highly capitalistic society. You look out for yourself, the guy down the block looks out for himself, we're all free. There's a reason universal health care doesn't exist here and why government services are awful. It's because no one wants to pay for something if there's a chance some hypothetical ""lazy"" person is going to benefit from it, even if you benefit from it. It's a miracle we even have EBT and Section 8 available for use.

The charges and prices you see for books, education, food, and shelter? That's the ""highly capitalistic"" half of our culture. You're free to charge whatever you see fit. And if it just so happens that some people can't afford it, that's on them. As for the food quality, American cuisine has come to be stereotyped as bad for you because half of the U.S. population is considered poor or low-income, and most food the poor can afford are bad for you.

I'm not saying any of this is good. I hate it. My partner and I are probably going to move to Europe some time after they graduate.

&gt;I've always heard that student activism is strong here in America, and that students can and usually do enact change. Students here seemed to just accept this situation and do nothing much about it.

Welcome to Tech! While most college students in America are left-leaning, you'll find the opposite here. I have a few hypotheses why. It's probably because we're in the Deep South, but it's also probably because there's a huge population of brainlords here who value their ability to solve equations more than being good humans.",Negative,"american culture, individualism, capitalism, universal healthcare, government services, poverty, education, food quality, student activism, college",2,2019-01-12

CompE is very hardware focused with most of the CS classes you take being electives (that are hard to get into if you aren't a CS major). As for CS, there are threads (essentially concentrations), which effect the types of classes you take, especially later on in your degree. I found [this](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/current/undergraduates/academics/plans) and [this](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/undergrad/curriculum_charts_cmpe_2018-2019.pdf) really helpful for making my decision. They are undergraduate study plans and will give you a good idea of the types of classes you would be taking in each degree. If you want more info on threads, you can find look up ""gatech cs threads"" or something like that. Oh yah but whatever you choose, I would highly suggest taking CS 1331.

And honestly, with a more arts based program half the reason you even go to college are the connections you make there. 

So as much as it pains me, if you're looking for a more traditional journalism school experience UGA might be a good other option to look at in state, but if your interested in working with digital media then tech is a good option for you.

comment,"&gt;It's ridiculous they pick up people with low GPAs and/or no talent in the name of diversity and fuck over the people who really deserve it.

That attitude makes me glad you’re not coming here. I get that you’re angry, but you sound like an entitled elitist who thinks they’re hot shit due to some grades and test scores. I’m glad there’ll be one less of that to deal with when classes start in the fall.

You don’t deserve anything just because you have good stats. You can overanalyze your stats compared to others’ that got deferred/accepted, blame it on your race, whatever. But the fact of the matter is, *whether it was a mistake or not,* you got rejected. You can try and fight it, but eventually you’ll have to accept it and move on, shit happens. 

There will always be someone you perceive as less qualified than you getting things that you want. You think this just happens in college admissions? Wait till you start applying for internships, research programs, jobs, competing for promotions etc. 

You can complain “boohoo me” and blame whatever happened on things out of your control, or you can accept it, move on, and use it as a learning opportunity to do better. 

Shit happens, failure is inevitable. It’s good that you’re learning to deal with it now before college, many students here don’t have that opportunity and struggle when they fail a test for the first time.

To me, your SAT score is not really a determining factor as it is more of checking a box. I had a relatively high SAT score and was still deferred then accepted. So while it is important to have a good score, there are much more important things to worry about. 

The biggest thing I think you need to focus on is being genuine in your essays and your application in general. Really show Tech that you want to be here and that you deserve to be here. Don't start doing things because you think it will look good and that Tech wants to see it. Do things because you want to do them and because you enjoy it. 

However, on top of that, it is still important to show that you are pushing yourself academically and can handle the pressure and difficulty of Tech. Maintain good grades, take harder classes, and do make sure that your test scores are decent. Everything comes together to help your chances of getting in, there isn't just one thing in particular that determines if you get in or not.","Neutral

If you're looking to do theory CS, then professors look for sophisticated mathematical ability. This can be best proved if you sit in their classes, so you should consider sitting in their 3000/400 level undergraduate or graduate classes (for example, the instructor of Graduate Theoretical Machine Learning has been known to give out ideas for open ML research questions during class). In terms of asking professors for research, it's definitely a possibility freshman year (I think maybe Boots has a lab you can join? Also Cruz has been known to accept freshman). I don't know if you need anything fancy like a portfolio.. most people I know read up on a few of the professor's papers and had a 60 second elevator speech on why they were qualified an interested. 

If you want to join a community of researchers, join Theory Club! Theory Club has members doing research with most of the TCS faculty and knows which professors are available / their area of specialization.

comment,"Depending on where you went to high school, it's probably not quite like high school lunch. A big obvious difference is that high schools generally only serve (mostly) what they view as healthier food, whereas the dining halls serve healthy and unhealthy food and leave it up to you to decide how you'll eat.

The reasons people complain about the dining halls are myriad. First, if you enroll in Freshman Experience, you'll be automatically billed $2,500/semester your first year for a few hundred meal swipes. Unless you spend all day going to the dining halls, you'll never use anywhere near that number of swipes, so you lose hundreds or thousands over a year to unused swipes. If you used every swipe, the cost per meal isn't that bad, but it's outrageous factoring in unused swipes.

Furthermore, the halls often operate on schedules that almost feel like they're designed to prevent students from using them to maximum efficiency. People have found dirt/bugs/metal/etc in food multiple times. Many stations/machines are often not making food/broken. Plates/bowls/utensils are often not properly washed.

I could go on and on. The thing is: the freshmen are a captive market. Nobody other than them buys swipes, so pressure on the dining halls remains relatively low across campus, as it only affects a group that is forced to spend large amounts of money on the plans.",Neutral,"high school, dining halls, complaints, freshman experience, meal swipes, cost, efficiency, food quality, equipment, market.",22,2019-01-13

comment,"**Part 1 (6 weeks)- Travel Portion:**

The first week will be spent at Tech (first week of summer semester), where you will be taking a Art History and Music History class for 2.5 hours each day (Monday through Friday), and an exam on Saturday

The good news is for the next 5 weeks, you will only have class once per city (8 cities) and a final exam at the end of the Travel Portion. Daily schedule consists of going to (required) art museums, churches, and classical music concerns( at night). On most days, after 2PM or so you'll get the rest of the day free to yourself. On certain days you'll be traveling on a bus when you go from city to city and the day you arrive in each city, you will have a group dinner.

During this portion you will go into one of three groups. All groups will go to 6 common cities and each group will have 2 unique ones. Back when I did it in Summer 16', all groups went to Paris, Venice, Rome, Florence, Vienna, and Prague while our group solely went to Munich and Bruges. The other groups were Krakow/Berlin, and Budapest/Ghent.

What I love about this program is that , you not only get to see all these beautiful churches, monuments, as well as attend classical music concerts but also even if you don't know anyone (I'm not Greek and I only knew 2-3 people going in), you'll make 50 new friends along the way especially during this portion.

EDIT: obvious but keep in mind group dinners in each city, traveling costs, hotel rooms, monument/church/museum visits/classical concerts are all covered by the program

**Part 2 (6 weeks)- Oxford University Portion:**

All 3 groups combine.

This is more like other programs where you have 3 day weekends, and you can travel anywhere in Europe. You will take 2 classes of your choice, each of which are 1.5 hours (with Friday's off). You will have breakfast and dinner covered (English breakfasts are amazing, please take advantage lol). There's also a few clubs/bars close by, as well as a bar on campus which has like Karaoke Monday's, Trivia Tuesday's, billiards, darts, etc etc

The only bad part of this program is that you'll miss it all when you leave. You'll never get to travel around, visit monuments, and go on pub crawls with your peers like this ever again. Even after the program our group was still really close and hung out whenever we could, for about a year or so.

If you ever feel like you are beginning to get behind, get help immediately. PLUS Sessions are fantastic and I am a huge advocate of going straight to your professor.

Also, there are literally countless online resources for every OChem topic that you can think of so Youtube, Google, Khan academy, etc... are your best friends.

comment,"Just to add my two cents on this...go to class and PLUS sessions and think very hard about the utility of class for you. Unpopular opinion: if class isn’t useful, stop going and start spending more time reading the text and other resources online (Master Organic Chemistry, the Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry, and the Illustrated Glossary of Organic Chemistry are my favorites) and really digging in to practice problems. Of course, it will be up to you to match up the portions of these resources that are relevant to what is covered in class.

I poked my head into Reynolds’s lecture on Friday, and I can tell you that the skill level he demonstrated in lecture is much lower than you will be expected to deliver in exams, at least for the subject of resonance. In other words, you will need to do some heavy lifting outside of class to meet the standard of performance. If lecture plus that work is not paying off, strongly consider replacing lecture with something more useful.

By the way, this isn’t so much about the quality of Reynolds’s teaching as it is about what is best _for you_ learning-wise. As mentioned in another comment, office hours can be extremely valuable.

Got deferred for GT first time around, got in regular (after I had already signed a housing contract and going to commit somewhere else after what I expected to be my final rejections). Absolutely possible to get in on the regular decision, don’t feel too bad about it.

Not at all. Administration can be fired if it goes against the grain of the alumni. 

&gt;  There are a good number of schools with student bodies whose political views generally differ from that of the school's administration, so using the general political views of one particular body is not very helpful in determining the political views of the other body.

Which Georgia Tech course advocates for seizing the means of production? 

Which statistics curriculum expose sampling biases from monetized economies?

Which efficiency metric is done without cost? (hint: in this one it actually *can* be measured in joules)

That was my only contention with regards to that particular point.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, your three rhetorical questions are just... silly. 

""Which Georgia Tech course advocates for seizing the means of production?"" Marxism isn't the only left-wing ideology, unless you want to argue that e.g. social democracies are right-wing.

""Which statistics curriculum expose sampling biases from monetized economies?"" Do they need to in order to be classified as non-right wing? Because I don't see a relationship there.

""Which efficiency metric is done without cost?"" I'm seeing a pattern of you just placing a very narrow focus, which is not helpful in making broad analyses.

""Show why that's incorrect. Perhaps provide an example of ""non-"" market oriented interaction."" Even in Marxist economic theory, there is a form of exchange with parties that can be considered ""buyers"" and ""sellers"", with the exchange currency being labor vouchers (though they are generally not considered to be equivalent to money in a traditional sense, for they do not circulate).

comment,"&gt;  that e.g. social democracies are right-wing.

center.

&gt;Because I don't see a relationship there.

It would help me identify which sample groups are subject to which cultural biases. For example, if a population of 40 college kids are brought in to complete polls and surveys, any margins for error are subject to the cultural biases inherent in both the sample group and the one writing the survey (such as Ariely at Duke for example). An interesting study was done basically:

""Game Theory across the world"", where plenty of Papua New Guineans highlight the idiocy of Nash Equilibrium. 

What does it say about the college kids' indoctrination on fairness, incentive, social roles, individualism, and community? 

&gt;I'm seeing a pattern of you just placing a very narrow focus, which is not helpful in making broad analyses.

Efficiency need not equal cost, that's kind've my greater goal. To remind an engineering-minded audience how 'waste' can (And is) measured in 'real science' units. Heat is waste on a circuit board. Runoff is waste in an industrial farm. 

&gt;there is a form of exchange with parties that can be considered ""buyers"" and ""sellers"", with the exchange currency being labor vouchers 

I'd argue ""not necessarily"". The labor vouchers would be issued by someone conducting ""labor"" themselves. Thus anyone who uses labor vouchers is indirectly 'vouching' for the issuer, and thus selling on their behalf. 

&gt; Marx's Capital, Volume I or Grundrisse. 

I'd say that's correct. I've yet to dig into the Tome of Kapital. I've only really read the *manifesto*. I have a laundry list of problems with inherently viewing all social conflict as if it were associated with 'class', however.

The main tenant of ""what makes NeoLiberalism Neoliberalism"" is *""market-based solutions.*""

I'm seeing if you (or anyone else aware) can bring to light additional methods of trade and interaction instead of what's used on the 'money plane' (or at least away from markets). Questions might involve:

* In the Indus River Valley Empire, how did beads change hands and was there any specialization of labor ? 

* In Native American Mississippians (Cahokia), how did Copper move from Mexico to Indiana? 

* How did the [Pueblo Indians](https://news.wsu.edu/2016/12/20/computer-models-find-ancient-solutions-modern-problems/) decide which 'resources' for which agriculture harvests? 

These types of questions (and hopefully answers) show how money-based groups of people might come to better and worse answers (or, more aptly for me, without money). 

As for GT, it's definitely one of the most right-wing schools I've ever visited.

Also, here is what the a staff member told me on reddit, explaining the library's new philosophy:

&gt; However, I would argue insisting on more and more quiet space misses the point of the tremendous amount of research that influenced this building — despite some users not believing the research exists or its findings. I understand that for the people commenting on these threads, the quiet and corrals were the most important feature in the library.

&gt;However, extensive research has shown that they are in the vast minority of students at Tech. The future of this Institute is in collaborative work, and this building is built for the work styles of the next 50-odd years.

&gt;That said, we won’t ever stop building spaces for or serving students who need quiet space. We have to allocate the limited resources we have in the most judicious way. There are a tremendous number of factors at play in a multi-million dollar renovation. We simply can’t give everyone exactly what they want.

In my (granted limited) experience a degree that's comparatively easy in one respect is harder in another. Psychology is hugely competative, and if you want to do anything in the academic field you'll have to go grad school. Georgia Tech culture places a huge emphasis on vocational training compared to other universities, so many people are measured ""how can you contribute to society by getting a rewarding job immediately after graduation."" For non STEM majors, it's not a direct path or a straight shot.  

Like most social science, it still requires some degree of programming that you can always fall back on - typically R or Python - if you want to pivot to data analytics ever. My suggestion is to identify what you want to do with a psychology degree, and do what you can as an undergrad to develop relevent research experience. Otherwise, consider combining psych with some other marketable dimension. I was political science. Now I'm combining it with cybersecurity.

It’s not really fair to look at how Price Gilbert has operated since 2016 and expect that very specific point in time to dictate how the Library would function moving forward. 

As far as personal agendas, I’m not really sure what you mean. There seems to be this odd belief (you’re not the first to bring it up on these boards) that the entirety of library and institute leadership, the world-renowned architects, the facilities and designs teams, and the faculty, student and grad boards who worked on this project somehow coalesced, then planned and executed a building that expressed some deeply held personal belief against quiet personal space. More so, that all those people were operating not from a place of wanting to build the best library they could based on data collected specifically for this project, but instead were trying to actively ensure unhappy students. 

Nothing could be further from the truth.

comment,"I'm a recent transfer to tech so I have some knowledge of how it compares. I transferred from another school here in Georgia where I studied physics. The classes and their material is roughly on par and the professors are a definite step up. The main difference in my mind is the work load. It's quite a lot, but manageable if you stay organized and on top of things. It's hard no doubt, but more than doable. If you've gotten into tech I'm assuming you have a decent work ethic so itll be doable.

I think one of the biggest advantages of tech is the opportunities right out of school. Later in your career your school will probably matter less and less but the fact that so many people know tech and hold it in a high regard will absolutely help with jobs and internships out of the gate. That can then help translate to better career opportunities down the road.

comment,"&gt;Looking up reviews of FSU brings up people talking about how great their professors are and the student life, but looking up GT seems to be mostly people talking about how soul-sucking the classes are.

It's a part of the *aesthetic*. Tech is a tough school, and students tend to embrace that toughness and turn it into some kind of experience, so you can say that you graduated like it's a badge of honor (i.e. instead of ""I graduated"", you say ""I got out"" like you survived something). Part of it's overblown, but a lot of it is legit (i.e. there are very legitimate concerns regarding student mental health at Tech, classes *are* comprehensive and difficult, and you're expected to do a lot of work).

&gt;Is it just the engineering/ CS majors that find it so terrible?

It's not just engineering/CS majors that have a hard time, but these people comprise an overwhelming majority of the student body, so you hear from them the most. 

&gt;I want to major in neuroscience, but there isn't much out there about GT and neuroscience.

Check out the GT college of sciences website. They'll have some information available. Also, reach out to a professor - literally google ""GT neuroscience professors"", find someone who's doing something that sounds interesting you, write them an email, and ask them about what the program is like at Tech and what they do. I'm almost positive they'll be happy to talk to you about Tech.

&gt;I know I'll have to take calc, CS, and Physics I and II and I don't have very much experience in any of those things. I'm kind of afraid I'm going to be overstressed and crash and burn freshman year if I go to Tech because of my terrible math skills (I'll probably be bottom of the barrel for Tech math-ness)...Are the math parts of this whole deal really that awful?

I'm sorry to say that even in neuroscience you'll probably need good skills in at least a couple of those classes no matter where you go. Tech's classes are probably a bit more difficult than, say, FSU/Drexel, but at the same time none of the intro math classes (that is, non-engineering math/CS classes) are designed to be weed-out classes or anything. If you have already gotten into Tech or you think Tech is a legitimate option for you, it might take some work but you'll be fine.

&gt;I could go to FSU or Drexel, but I'm afraid I won't have as much of an edge without that ""GT Difference"" people keep talking about. I'm also especially worried that people will judge me for going to an ""easier"" school instead of going here just because I was afraid of the math classes.

This is the single most valuable piece of advice I've ever been given, and I didn't really understand it at the time but it sunk in after a while and I've taken it to heart:

*No school is ever that special*.

In looking for colleges, you might worry about how ""oh, if I go to FSU, my degree won't look as impressive as if it came from Georgia Tech!"". Sure, but that's really over-estimating the actual impact of the degree. Sure, the difference between, say, Drexel and Harvard, might give a future employer pause, but not for very long. Employers care that you have a degree and that you've done the legwork, have the resume, have connections, etc. and at that point, having a degree from Tech vs. having a degree from FSU is basically moot.

Mind you, where you go to school influences *the other stuff too* - like research opportunities, networking, etc. And don't discount that!

But don't ever worry about people judging you because you went to some ""easier"" school. GT is not for everyone, and nobody will penalize you, socially or professionally, for going to another good program somewhere else.

comment,"I think this discussion brings up really interesting points on student life that have been discussed on this subreddit over the last few months. The most cynical response to the new library design would be to say that the design emphasizes form over function, catering to prospective students instead of actual students in the name of brand appreciation.

I don't necessarily agree with this, but to respond to your statement u/GTLibrary I definitely think that there is a bit of an agenda on the part of designers and planners to guide students towards a certain way of doing things. This is even stated in Georgia Tech's vision, ""to define the technological research university of the twenty-first century."" As stated in another comment, I find it hard to believe that after doing research even before 2016, you'd still only allocate this amount of quiet personal space without having some sort of vision beyond what students currently demand.

Personally, I'm getting out pretty soon so I may just be an old dog that can't be taught new tricks, but I think as a STEM focused institution, the proportion of introverted students that learn best studying alone won't change that much in the future. If you want more students to work together, there needs to be a major reworking of the curriculum in some classes, which honestly could be an answer. Until then, there will be a void of quiet study space for students.

I really do thank you though for engaging in this discussion, and would love to be apart of any continued discussion on how to best utilize the new library space.",Neutral,"student life, library design, curriculum, quiet study space, stem, vision.",11,2019-01-14

-I do intense cardio for at least 20 minutes as soon as I come home from work, especially if I'm tired. I drink a mug of green tea with my meal afterwards.

-I found an extremely convenient living location, so work is a 5 minute walk. Long car commutes destroy energy. Audiobooks used to help. 

-I avoid greasy foods and extremely meat-heavy meals. 

-I avoid talking to people that bore me or rub me the wrong way.

-I try not to sit down for too long at work, I take walks about every hour and a half.  

-I try to minimize the amount of boring work I have to do by addressing such issues with my manager (your mileage and employment status may vary)

-I don't work overtime, even if everyone else does (be careful!)

-I sleep about 8-10 hours every night, in part because:

       * I don't drink coffee after noon. 

       * I wear a sleep mask and earplugs. 

-I rarely drink, and never heavily. 

-I meditate regularly.


Minding these habits, after work I am usually able to:

 -Get about 2 hours of relatively focused personal programming.

-Have enough attention for about 1 lecture on some topic of interest.

-Read for about an hour before bed. 

I don't take breaks on weekends, so I have enough energy to get about 60-80 hours of work done a week, 20-40 of which are for personal growth.

-Go out of my way to cultivate meaningful personal relationships.

-Join social clubs, activities etc.

Based on your interests, I would look hard at the major requirements and course offerings for BME and EE to choose between the two majors; you might get more depth out of doing straight EE.

1) Like - easy to switch majors compared to most public schools, probably the best study abroad options of any college of  engineering where I've looked into that. 

Dislike - mostly a lot related to CS

2) Rarely competitive in my experience. I made a bunch of super collaborative CS friends, but I understand a lot of people prefer or end up working alone.

3) Depends on the major. It feels like all the BMEs and MSEs do research. It's not quite as popular as I'd like it to be in CS.

4) Teaching is a priority to them, but I can sometimes tell that they would like to minimize the time they spend doing it. I've generally either gotten respectful communication or no communication when I've asked for research, and more of the former.

5) Super easy, super common. CS makes you jump through hoops, but it's not like there's anything really bad. If you come in as a freshman, you're guaranteed 1 major switch.

6) It's kind of a pain to get my friends to come off campus, so aside from a semesterly concert, living in ATL without a car might as well be like living in a college town. 

Housing and food are not that bad. They're overpriced and bland,  but really people don't know worse, so they complain a lot. Having a roommate and required meal plan is really only a thing freshman year. People that really care can just live off campus or in greek housing often times.

2) Culture is all about who you surround yourself with, I haven't seen it being hyper competitive although I guess those people probably exist

3) I did research (outside my department no less) and so have a bunch of other people I know

4) Have had mostly OK professors, a couple really great ones and like 2 terrible ones. I don't think they have anything against undergrads lol not really sure what else you mean by attitude ha

5) Yea except to cs after year 1 I hear

6) I love Atlanta! GT housing is fine, I've lived in it all 4 years, Dining was fine the year I did it but people complain now so who knows

comment,"I don't represent all students' perspective, but a sizable amount would share my views. For background I study ME and will graduate this spring.

1. Biggest positive for me has been all of the opportunities I've had studying abroad and interning at really great companies. Coming into college, I did not expect to be able to have the kind of experiences I've had so far, and I know that, for the most part, I likely wouldn't have been able to get these kinds of internships and experiences at other schools I was looking at. Negatives for me are: a large degree of campus segregation i.e. fraternity/non-fraternity, self segregation by race/ethnicity, and a lack of being able to organically meet people on campus. Also the lack of diversity of thought, which I'll get to below. With that said, whether the benefits outweigh the negatives really depend upon your circumstances and what you hope to get out of college.
2. I wouldn't characterize the campus as hyper competitive. Collaboration amongst students is actually pretty good, although in my experience a lot of people just do their own thing in many of the core engineering classes and don't even try to meet people to collaborate. Not because of competitiveness, but because a lot of people here frankly don't care or don't have the skills necessary to meet and form groups. You'll see the same faces in a lot of your classes but not even know their names, which I think is kind of sad.
3. I know a lot of people involved with research, and it's not hard to get a position (although many involve imo pretty menial work). If you don't actively pursue it though, it won't be a part of your undergrad experience at all.
4. I do genuinely think that almost all professors here care about their students. I also think that, not disimilar to other respected research institutions, the teachers are not here because of their teaching abilities, and are promoted based on their research. I've heard similar complaints from people at Stanford, UMich, WashU as well as others, so honestly that's more of a system problem than Georgia Tech.
5. I know people who have changed like 2 or 3 times. Between ME, BME, EE and maybe even more I know it's literally just going to your advisor and filling out a form.
6. I like ATL a lot. Living on campus can feel like a bubble, especially during weeks when you have a lot of tests. But there are so many great restaurants and other cool places to explore around campus and throughout Atlanta. It's changed so much too. When I first got here in 2015 Spring street was kind of a dump. Now it's lined with new development. GT housing after freshman year is way overpriced, but there's a ton of really nice apartments for basically the same price just off campus that have been built/being built. They're honestly way nicer than students should have.
7. Very large ethnic diversity which is good, but not the kind of personality diversity I would have liked on a college campus. This place is meant to churn out as many highly qualified engineers as it possibly can, and it does a good job of that. But people here tend to mostly all have the same type of engineering mindset. If you know you want to be an engineer and would like to be with mostly other STEM types, then this place is perfect. Personally I would have liked to have more discussions with people interested in politics, international affairs, other liberal arts, and I never really found a sizable enough group interested in having these discussions. People will say there's a club for everything, but I wouldn't agree with that. Many of the clubs you'll find on Georgia Tech's website are either inactive or about to be. I was pretty disappointed by most that I tried out.

At the end of the day, I'm going to be graduating with great experience and making way more money than I should be. Sometimes I ask myself whether I could have had a better college experience, but honestly it is what you make of it no matter where you go.

&gt; The future of this Institute is in collaborative work

This is some of the dumbest shit I have ever read.  GT administrators have also apparently never read their own Academic Honor code, or the (reasonable, I might add), anti-collaborative policies professors **mandate** with regard to non-project-based homework in core engineering and science courses.  You can collaborate in a noisy environment almost anywhere on campus, yet finding a quiet place is becoming even more difficult than it has been in years past.

&gt; However, extensive research has shown that they are in the vast minority of students at Tech.

I find this exceedingly difficult to believe.  To whom it may concern:  Poll students with one of three options:  Do you believe private study space areas at GT should be 1.) Expanded 2.) Reduced 3.)

We knew when working on this project that, for instance, the Library hadn't undergone major renovations in basically the life of the buildings (there were certainly smaller-scale projects, but nothing of this magnitude). During those decades there will be tremendous change in American education -- as discussed by the Provost's Creating the Next commission, for one -- and this building plan was influenced heavily by those findings. So things that might not make sense right now start to look better in a more long-term setting (like as curriculum changes). This was one of the core design  principles -- long life, loose fit -- meaning we built spaces that can change and adapt to needs we can't fully anticipate today. Unfortunately, this can be painful in the here and now. ","Neutral

To be fair, the complaining isn't unwarranted. However, it is not an accurate picture of campus life or the Tech experience as a whole. 

1) Campus services do suck. GT Dining needs major improvement along with our Transportation system. The good news is if you have a bicycle or time it right, you can get around campus very easily. Other things at Tech are pretty great, there is something always going on and the campus is still active on weekends (unlike commuter schools). The academics and the people you meet here will truly be the greatest part. I love my peers and I've met amazing people doing incredible things. The benefits VASTLY outweigh the negatives. Its really easy to be salty about some student services being dogshit but it doesn't make Tech a bad school at all.

2) Culture here is mostly collaborative. I haven't seen any instance of people being hyper-competitive of sabotaging one another. Everyone I've encountered wants to help one another out. 

3) A lot of people do undergrad research, it's a very normal thing. Can't speak much more because I haven't done it.

4) Depends on the professor, as with most colleges. I would look at your required courses for whatever path you are going to go down and read their rate my professor page. 

5) Pretty sure it is, I haven't done it myself so again, can't talk about it much.

6) Living in ATL is amazing. You are close to public transit so easy access to Downtown, the airport, Lenox Mall, etc. 

6.5) GT Housing and Food is ass, but I don't think its a huge issue past your first year. 

7) Its 80% STEM, which has its upsides and downsides. There may be a stereotype that everyone here is an introverted nerd because of STEM, but that's not the case.

comment,"First of all, congrats on becoming a stamps semifinalist! That's a really big honor in itself and there's a lot of challenges ahead that I wish you luck on. I'm a first year stamps scholar, so I'm not sure how many overall GT questions I can answer, but I can answer some questions about the Stamps process if you have any.


That said:

1) I love how many opportunities around campus there are to get involved. There are a lot of really cool clubs on campus and they cover such a diverse range of interests that you're bound to find one you enjoy. 

One aspect that's fairly underrated is that Tech generally attracts a certain type of people. If you're the type of person Tech attracts, you'll have no issue meeting people and making friends with similar interests, no matter what those may be. The same people you party with on Friday nights will be the same you work on your linear algebra homework with and the same you play Smash with until your fingers hurt. 

The students make the campus moreso than anything the administration can do, so if you truly see yourself fitting here, it'll be a great place.

There are a few negatives such as the overall quality of some of the student resources. It's honestly a meme on this subreddit to complain about bad dining and a lack of individual study space, but both of those are very valid complaints. The benefits, for me at least, definitely outweigh the negatives.


2) I'm a sciences major, so my experience might not be reflective of Tech as a whole, but I've found the school to be very collaborative. Coming from a hyper competitive high school, collaboration is especially nice. There is a certain degree of mental health culture here, so do be wary of that. If you surround yourself with people you love, it's easier to keep a positive outlook, but even then, during some times of the year (such as finals week), things can get depressing on campus.


3) Almost everyone I know is involved in research in some way. If you come in with enough credits (&gt;30) to start in a VIP your first semester, I cannot recommend them enough. They're a great way to ease into research that you're interested in.


4) Teachers are very hit or miss. The good professors, however, are really good. Make sure to shop around for TA's, especially in math and in lab sciences because in math, the TA is who you'll be doing the most practice with, and in lab sciences, a bad TA can end up scoring your lab reports much lower than they should be. Rate my professor is your friend, and it's better to take a good professor with a weird schedule than it is to get the schedule you want but with bad professors.


5) It is both common and easy to change majors. Just talk to your advisor and you can get out as early as your second semester.

6) Atlanta is a great city with a lot of opportunities and a good music scene. You'll spend a lot more time on campus than off, though. If you want to experience more of Atlanta, it'll require some effort. GT housing is not that bad. GT dining is bad but not as bad as the subreddit makes it seem. 

I'm of the personal opinion that if you don't mind the extra time spent commuting to some classes, west campus housing (unless you manage to get into Glenn or Towers) and dining are both superior to east campus. As a potential stamps scholar, you have your choice of housing wherever you want. Unless you're in an LLC (which I would highly recommend), you're pretty much guaranteed great housing. 

As far as LLCs go, they're pretty dependent on your major but I'd rank the ""pecking order"" as follows: Honors &gt;= Explore &gt; Grand Challenges &gt;&gt; Global Leadership &gt; the rest. 

Grand Challenges offers the most opportunities, but it's in a bad dorm and you have a long required class. 

Honors offers the second most, and the dorm is pretty good, but you also have to take 15 total hours of honors level classes.

Explore (which used to be two different LLCs, smart for research, and sharp for pre-health) is really nice if you're research oriented and you're not taking a research based GT1000 (which as a stamps scholar you can't). The biggest pro for Explore is that it attracts people from all majors who are research focused rather than business focused. If you're research focused, you'll be surrounded by like-minded individuals who you'll most likely get along well with. Explorer's dorm quality is slightly lower than honors, but your dorm borders west village, so you don't have to go very far at all to get food or study. 

Global leadership is fine, but it's restricted to liberal arts majors, and the dorm itself sucks.


7) Now we touch on one of my least favorite parts of tech, but also the thing that makes it most unique: the lack of opportunities for pure liberal arts majors. Tech has very few liberal arts majors, and those that are liberal arts are mostly international affairs, economics, or public policy, all of which differ from similar programs at other schools because they are taught through the lens of STEM. Tech itself is still a diverse school with a large range of people in terms of culture and of hobbies. The Scholars selected for the Stamps program are extremely diverse.

The problem lies in a lack of course diversity. The range of humanities courses offered here is small, and the course you want might not even be offered in the semester you want to take it. If you're a stem major coming in with AP credit for your humanities, be prepared to take pretty much nothing but stem classes. If you hated non-stem courses in high school, this system is perfect, but if you have a passion for both science/engineering and liberal arts such as music or film, there's not really a degree track that reflects that.

On that note, it's still easy to surround yourself with people who have different opinions or majors. Most people I've met at tech have hobbies that make them pretty well rounded individuals. There are tons of musicians here, even outside of band, for example, and that's not necessarily something you might expect when you come here.

Racially and ethnically, Tech is an interesting place. There are a lot of cultures represented, to say the least. Tech has a large international population. In general, if you went to a racially diverse high school, Tech probably has a higher proportion of Asians and Indians and a lower proportion of African-Americans and Hispanics than you are used to. It's incredibly easy to surround yourself with new cultures and learn a lot about the world from talking to students here.

comment,"I can't speak to EE, but I can of BME.

First though, ignore my username. I love the BME at Tech, or else I wouldn't be in it. It is a hard major, at least for me, so sometimes I vent, mainly about workload.

1. I love the BME department. It is a collaborative environment and the classes are designed to make sure you are prepared for the industry and research. I can't speak to the pre-med side as I'm not pre-med, but there is a definite push to make sure people are ready to work in the industry.
2. I would say the culture depends on the class. Collaborative classes breed collaboration, whereas exam based classes can get competitive.
3. I actually know a bunch of people involved in research. BME requires you to either: get a minor, do 12 hrs of research, or be pre-something to graduate. There are also additional opportunities to research for credit. It is not only easy to find some, but it is also encouraged and almost required.
4. It depends. Some people care, some think you aren't worth their time. Sometimes it seems like they don't care when in fact they are busy and they want the best for you. Some classes are set up so that you are more independent and have minimal interaction with faculty and staff. Research your professors before you take a class, and know that most if not all TA's care at the very least.
5. I know many people that have switched out of BME... can't speak to any others though.
6. ATL is a pretty cool place. It is not a college town, and as such isn't geared towards 18-year-olds at all, but there is still lots to do if you look and are willing to uber or have a friend with a car. Housing and dining have been hit or miss for me. At the end of the day, there are lots of great options for both that are cheaper and better right off campus.  (Home park is safer than you think, especially if you live on the main road.)
7. I'm about to graduate, so I haven't really seen a non engineering/science student in a while, but it will feel less diverse major wise than it is. The business school is across the highway from the main campus, so you are less likely to see anyone. There's a fair number of true science (science but not engineering or CS) students, but again they take different courses in different buildings so you are less likely to interact with someone in a totally different major. This is a thing at many colleges, especially after the core requirements are out of the way. Personally, I don't have any friends studying humanities here who are not pre-med or the like, but that's more because I'm old and I barely see any non- BME's anymore.

Personally, and this is only from my interactions on campus so  could be very wrong, I feel we have a fair number of students from different Asian backgrounds, and a strong SHEP program here, although the student population would be hard to say (I have many friends in SHEP so I couldn't honestly tell you how many Hispanic students we have). We definitely have less African American students, I've noticed anyway. There are many clubs and organizations (advertised at least) for different ethnic and cultural groups, if you are worried about not being able to celebrate your heritage with people here. All in all, we aren't as diverse as we could be, but it is definitely a better diversity than some state schools would be.",Positive,"college, bme, diversity, research, classes, campus life.",1,2019-01-15

comment,"Yo my dude(tte)

Change can make anyone feel stressed, often hugely stressed.

First, remember there are resources around that you can (and should) use to help manage your mental health and stress.  What you are describing is concerning, you know that. It takes a lot of bravery, but using them is usually the best path forward. Lots of faculty do or would benefit from taking advantage of those resources for our self. Asking for help isn't a failure, it's an achievement.

Second, I think there is another thing to consider about why you are feeling overwhelmed...everyone else has had a couple years figuring out how this place 'works.' Everything from where you can get food on campus to where the bathrooms are to how faculty communicate about a syllabus or class is to some extent cultural - if you don't know this stuff, because you haven't learned it along with everyone else, it's easy to feel like a failure or like you are in over your head. Another way to look at it is you are learning about GT, it takes a little time, give yourself a little grace that it's a big transition no matter what school you are coming from. My first semester I got questions (""hey where can I print this?"" ""Will you let me do an overload?"") that felt dead simple and yet I had no clue...it's truly frustrating but it does get better. IT WAS PRINTING! I HAVE A PHD! HOW CAN I NOT ANSWER THIS STUDENT QUESTION? (literally...thoughts that went through my head).

Third, this stuff tends to be cyclical...one possible way to to break out of that cycle is to use the resources you have. A common cause of student spirals in terms of academic performance is faculty not knowing enough to reach out and help. You probably have tutors available - use them. You should have office hours available - go ask questions (and be vulnerable about what you are struggling with, we are paid to teach courses not to sit in judgement of you). If you are taking GT2000 - talk to your instructor, your classmates, or your team leader. 

In sum, your feelings are valid and understandable. It's awesome you feel comfortable sharing them, doing so is amazingly brave. You are paying for a ton of resources at GT to help in situations like this, might as well get your moneys worth.",Positive,"mental health, stress, resources, overwhelmed, transition, academic performance, support, gt2000, vulnerability.",19,2019-01-15

First off, if you need to drop a class, its probably worth it. There are obviously finicial implications, and you should look into them for your specific situation, but your health is more important than money.

Id also recommend finding something you can do that isnt school that you enjoy. You cant do school 24/7, and if you can find something you enjoy that lets you not worry about school for a day or even a few hours that can do wonders.

Lastly id recommend talking to someone 1 on 1, whether its a counselor, friend, family, whoever, it can be really helpful, even if you just vent about school and get it off your chest, I think that is helpful (at least for me).

comment,"(only a freshman so take w/ grain of salt)

1 &amp; 2: for me personally, im an artsy/creative person and ive found it to be really lacking in much arts culture which sucks, but also i'm not the most outgoing so maybe i just haven't found it yet. id say collaborative more than competitive. there are some assholes always trying to show off or shittalk, but theyre usually loud and easily avoidable. most people are either totally quiet or really friendly &amp; down to study w/ you/hang out.

3: can't speak much to this

4: it truly depends on the individual profs. some only care about their research and are useless/careless or downright annoying. others are some of the most inspiring and friendly people in the world, so just use ratemyprofessors and you'll have no problems in this area. as far as admin, they sometimes seem a bit... apathetic/slow in reaction to student requests, as you might see with the constant complaining about dining/transport/construction/etc and little change. but, overall these admin issues have little impact on daily life and are just something to complain about lmao, not a big deal at all.

5: yeah very easy, i'm switching right now and it's literally 1) print a form 2) get the department head of the new major to sign off 3) get your old major to sign off, both of which you can either drop by their office or schedule an appointment and it's fast as fuck. im not sure about other majors, but the CS advisor literally told me in a meeting today that for people trying to switch into CS, they'll accept anyone who's not failing out. for some certain small programs there might be restrictions but literally none i've ever heard of

6: ATL is pretty great, tho i've lived here my whole life so idk can't compare much. always stuff to do and nice whether. good balance between a big city and still having lots of green. housing is fine tbh, nothing wrong with it from my view, plus you can live off campus in a lot of places that are fuckin walking distance so. food is whatever, dining halls are gross so i recommend the weekday dining plan, but everything in the student centers either decent or really good, if somewhat over price

7: honestly you'll be surrounded mostly by STEM or business majors. i've only met a handful of LMC/ID/liberal arts people so if that's a concern it is kind of real. relates to what i said about a lack of artistic stuff going on, but on the other hand atlanta is a great place for that. visit art shows, museums, get into the local music scene &amp; you'll find a way wider variety of ppl. might have to make friends at gsu n scad for any real academic diversity tbh. basically liberal arts people exist, u just won't bump into a ton in your classes, gotta seek them out in extracurriculars n stuff. also taking humanities/LMC classes for free electives, or minors! we have a film minor, a science fiction minor, music tech, ID minor. not too much work and some cool classes where you'll probably meet a wider range of people. cultural diversity is a definite majority of white people and asian people, but lots of international students too. as a girl i find the male/female ratio isn't that noticeable tho.",Neutral,"college life, academics, arts, culture, social life, diversity.",1,2019-01-15

comment,"When nearly all of the desks were taken on the third/fourth floor of Price Gilbert and the only quiet space was that archives reading room on the first floor close to the CULC entrance, I would wear a hoodie or something to cut down my peripheral vision. Further, I would bring some semi (a.k.a inexpensive) noise-cancelling headphones and some cheap foam earplugs (looks like they stock some at Target). By playing some kind of white-noise background sound (like recorded rainfall off youtube) through my headphones and foam earplugs, I could more or less mute my surroundings. 

You should also have the right to tell people to be quiet if you are all on the quiet floors and if they don't, be able to escalate by asking a librarian to explain the quiet rules. Most times if I asked politely, people talking or whispering would respect those rules and move to another area or be quiet in the study area. I would still do the stuff above to cut out surrounding sights and sounds because typical study behavior produces some noise without any kind of talking.

If I had the money for it, I would donate for a small version of the library we had: some actual books (especially the reference volumes) and quiet floors with quiet cubicles for deep thinking. There's nothing like pure silence and lack of distractions to help the brain develop memories, solve problems, and focus. There's nothing like flipping through a big reference book of engines to quickly compare your options and find a match for your obscure research project. 

Even at my company with mostly collaborative work, people would find corners to ""hide"" in to get deep-thinking, individual assignments done. Silence is so helpful. Admittedly not everyone needed this as much as I did, so perhaps there are many people who simply don't understand the requirement from some of us.

comment,"I completely agree. I did my BS many years before my MS degree, and the overcrowding in recent years is stifling. 

In 2004-2005, my freshman year, the entire student body was 16,841. Undergrad total was 11,546. 

In 2017-2018, numbers soared to 28,933 total and 15,136 undergrad alone. It's crazy, and you feel that everywhere there's really just too many people. I feel for you guys who started in this era of overcrowding. It was much nicer before with only about 17,000 students! 

Note: it's difficult without further research to know how much of that increase reflects the addition/ growth of distance learning and other campuses... but in the official numbers, part time grad students went from 881 to 4813, so I'd assume most of that is distance learning. Even accounting for these factors, there's a huge increase in the Atlanta campus student population.

You can put you were an honor grad all day, but when most top med schools see a 3.1 or 3.2 the application is pretty much disposed of.

comment,"Excellent question! I’ll try to answer that with a mix of both technical and non-technical terminology, but definitely ask follow-up clarifying questions if you have any.

One of the most common misconceptions about rowing machines is that higher resistances and stroke ratings make for better workouts. For the average person, just going on the erg and yanking chain at max resistance as fast as you can for 10 minutes isn’t going to do much besides put a lot of stress on your lower back. That would be like expecting to get better at running because you sprinted a mile or two as fast as you can and called it a day.

People would benefit much more by extending the length of their pieces and dropping the rate/intensity. The goal is to stay in your aerobic zone for as long as you can at a consistent rate in order to increase your aerobic threshold day by day.

Assuming you know how to set up the monitor, an ideal workout for beginners would be 60ish minutes of steady state rowing split up into chunks (e.g. 2x30’ or 3x20’ with 2-3’ of active rest) done at 18-20 strokes per minute, which is the number in the upper right hand of the screen. As far as the intensity goes, the specific figure really depends on the individual, but 55-60% of your maximum wattage output is a good goal to start off with. The erg’s resistance should be set somewhere in the 4-5 range; there is no scenario in which setting the resistance to 10 is a good idea for any casual rower.

-avoid tech. the risks to your GPA aren't the worth it. the first step to becoming a doctor is getting into med school and tech honestly diminishes those chances compared to comparable state school (ut austin, uga)

-if you do decide to go to tech, i would strongly advise choosing a different major than bio. if you do something like IE, you stand out from other med school applicants and have a degree from the best IE school in the country so you will have a career if med school does not work out 

Side note: if one option requires taking out loans vs one that doesn't, go with the one that doesn't. if you're likely to have zell/hope at tech vs massive amounts of debt at UT-austin, then go tech (or another ga state school where you would get similar benefits).",Negative,"education, career, risk",11,2019-01-16

I will agree with the other poster that it does depend on the lab, but as an EE if you end up in ATAS, ELSYS or CIPHER then you'll be fine.  SEAL was a newer lab when I was there so I don't know much about it, and EOSL was viewed as not so great.  Keep in mind that I co-oped there from 2011-2012 so it might be different now.

Overall I have to say that GTRI is a great place to work if you're highly technical, and I gained most of my hands-on control systems experience from that job (I ended up becoming a PLC/industrial controls engineer).  As far as brand recognition goes, GTRI is pretty widely known throughout the defense industry as well as a few others.

The only benefit GTRI offers is pay, and while it wasn't high on the scale I would certainly rate it as competitive.

It's 100% doable, but needs both parties to be completely committed and people might have differing relative priorities freshman year (Homework, new friends/partying, Greek Life, etc.) that can make it tough to manage.

-Work on any trust/priority issues either of you might have

-Nip any even potential issue in the bud - distance can exacerbate issues that wouldn't even register in person and make totally normal issue unsolvable.

comment,"No problem at all! I actually came out of last semester with a 2.63 GPA (One C and two B’s) and don’t let that scare you! Trust me, last semester (when I was currently getting my grades back) I felt horrible and like shit about myself. 

But now, it really made me realize how little that number matters! 

I think my best advice is: Don’t worry about grades right now! Focus on learning how this school works, and getting into your rhythm. Try to study in different ways and see what’s best for you. Try different studying techniques, try a new location. Try to go to different club meetings, try going to the gym a little bit! Really, try to be a Georgia Tech student. Last semester, I felt like “A Georgia State Student taking classes at Georgia Tech” and that kind of disconnect can really get to you, so I highly suggest trying to find your way here first before worrying about grades! 

Wish you all the luck, but I know you won’t need it, because you fought hard enough to get here, so I know you can fight hard enough to be successful here ;-) 

The best piece of advice I got, was actually during my CS1331 professor (Simpkins) during lecture: If you’re feeling a bit of imposter syndrome because Georgia Tech is full of really smart people; well you’re right.

It's also very intimidating to be on the other side of this equation and feel responsible for teaching a bunch of really smart students who are going to change the world new information.

comment,"Just wanna let you know that you don’t need your ex, my guy!! Do this for yourself, not for someone else! 

I know it can be hard to go to the gym when you don’t have anyone to show you what to do, but here are some tips that I have learned the last few years I’ve taken up lifting:

1. Have a routine! There are lots of people who just go willy nilly from machine to machine, and that will not produce gains at an optimal rate. I do a 3 day rotation: Chest and Triceps day 1, Back and Biceps day 2, and Leg and Auxiliary (shoulders, forearms) day 3, then repeat. This gives muscle groups time to heal between other muscle days. 

2. Protein powder is your friend for gains. Try to eat more food too (I know it can suck). Whatever you can do to increase your caloric intake is good for trying to get bigger!

3. Don’t be discouraged to go to the gym if you aren’t a jacked and juicy Chad (yet). Nobody starts going to the gym ripped, everyone starts somewhere. As long as you show up 4 or 5 plus days a week and try your best, that’s big respect from me. Also try to go 4-5 days a week. If you’re serious about seeing growth, you need to put in those hours!!

4. Don’t be afraid to go alone! I find that just having music in and working the weights is very calming and focusing. I find that if I workout with a buddy I tend to talk a lot and it takes more time. If you’re itching for a conversation, talk to someone at the gym! If they aren’t in the middle of a set, people are usually friendly for a quick chat (but don’t carry it on too long - that’s a definite no-no). If you have questions or want tips, most people find it flattering that you’re asking them. Definitely Google “Gym Etiquette” for this and many other gym dos and donts. 

5. You will be sore. That’s a great sign that you’re doing it right! Many people get sore after the first 3 days and feel weak and discouraged. It’s actually your body worn out after not working out for a while (or perhaps ever)! You’re shocking the system. By day 4 or 5, you will not notice the extreme soreness as much. That means you want to push yourself a little harder each time so you can feel sore. Then you know you’ve done a good job. 

So those are some tips from a once newbie. The internet is your friend! There are plenty of workout sheets online that will suggest what exercises to do, how many sets and how many reps. If you don’t know something, youtube it! You aren’t alone and I’m glad you are wanting to improve your strength. The self discipline of going isn’t always easy, but I think you want this badly enough. Good luck, and get those gains!",Positive,"fitness, gym, self-improvement, encouragement, workout routine, nutrition",7,2019-01-17

2. [https://crc.gatech.edu/outdoor/adventure](https://crc.gatech.edu/outdoor/adventure)

3. When you are stressed, say or think 15-20 things in your life you are grateful for. (The person working in a factory overseas somewhere that sewed your comforter together. Grateful for the bus drivers that come to work everyday to support their families. Grateful for the custodial staff that work rotating shift 24 hours a day. It may not always be the cleanest but someone takes the classroom trash out every day. Grateful for the person that tried to maintain greenspaces on campus. Grateful for the person that cares enough to provide flu shots for students, the person that made the flyers, and the person that spent their day going around campus to put them up, etc.)

4. Take a bad thing and list the positives of it (at least 20). Hard at first, but eye-opening. (i.e. had a previous bad relationship = 1. It's over and that's positive 2. I've learned what I don't want in a partner 3. I've learned that being in a bad relationship makes me a worse person, and I want to be the best that I can and find someone that supports me 4. I realize I am deserving of being in a good relationship and it gets me closer to knowing who I really am inside and what I stand for. 5. Relationships end and that's okay. Life continues on and now I have the opportunity to find someone that I align better with. 6. I learned XY&amp;Z about the opposite sex (or same sex).  6. I learned \_\_\_\_\_ about relationships in general that I didn't know before. 7. I've grown as a person. 8. I realize now I'm not good at \_\_\_\_\_\_ in a relationship and I need to work on that for myself. etc, etc, etc.)

5. Fake it 'til you make it. You can more easily find friends, especially in smaller classes, by initiating conversations. Really difficult internally, but you have to go across your mental wiring and fake starting conversations until you become more comfortable being around someone, and then it'll just be natural.  If you feel terrified of starting a conversation with someone you don't know, just think how pleasantly surprised you'd be if someone did it to you and that will take out some of the fear.

Luckily, Dell knows this. Call/live chat them, tell them it has bad coil whine, and they'll ship you a free replacement at equal or greater specs. You can even keep using the current unit until the replacement arrives, at which point you'll ship it back to them at no cost. It is possible the new one will also have an issue, but that's quite unlikely and you can always get another replacement.

I originally paid for one with an i7, 8 GB RAM, and 256 GB SSD. The replacement was i7, 16 GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD!",Negative,"customer service, laptop, quality control",3,2019-01-17

- Choose a navy, charcoal, or mid grey suit either solid colored or lightly patterned. Not black.

There’s nothing inherently wrong with them, and I definitely don’t think wearing one is going to cost you a job you’re otherwise qualified for (especially in the kind of field a Tech grad would be going into).  In the traditional professional world, wearing a black suit is just kind of an indicator that the wearer is a newbie and doesn’t know better, which is true, but still not something you should necessarily want to embrace/broadcast. I totally understand if that makes you roll your eyes or scoff at the “business fashion snobs”, but it is a real thing.

A tl;dr for OP, though: multiplying by a 2x2 matrix is like rotating and stretching the 2d plane. (Same for 3d, 4d, and so forth, but 2d is really easy to visualize.) Any rotation/stretch that keeps straight lines straight (a ""linear transformation"") can be represented by a matrix.

Imagine a vector ""before"" and ""after"" this stretch/rotation. Most of the time,  the transformation will change the direction that the vector is facing. But if you choose the vector *just* right, it won't change direction at all! It might shrink or elongate, but it'll point the same direction before and after. Such a vector is called an *eigenvector*, and the ""scale factor"" by which it gets stretched or squashed is its corresponding *eigenvalue*. ",Positive,"math, linear algebra",9,2019-01-18

I’m no expert but mental health isn’t as simple as just saying I’m depressed and oh let me go get help. They don’t help me, welp guess I just gotta go kill myself then. It’s a series of multiple paths and in the end, the people that make the most powerful impact are the immediate peers and friends. Stamps may not have the resource to personally care for you or want to, but there are definitely resources in Atlanta where you can get help (not to mention Georgia Tech is pretty damn close to the Emory hospital and their services). 

In the end if it comes down to cost, Tech can’t help you much. The amount you pay for mandatory fees seems like a lot, but when you factor in the cost of operation for stamps, that’s a measly sum to expect Tech to have a full blown mental treatment facility, 24/7 emergency services, free flu shots, checkups, psychiatry, and whatever else the fee funds is a bit of an overkill. 

In the end I’m just trying to say don’t blame stamps for everything. Sure people committed suicide and improvements need to be made, but there is only so much that the school can do for you. As a lot of people probably know and hear, college ain’t free; there are resources but they won’t/can’t come to you all the time when you need it.

comment,"Oh boy..stepping into the breach. 

They care very much. Faculty care, administrators care, other students care. What's hard is getting mutual trust that enables the effective communication of that care. The way it's expressed and worked on doesn't seem to tell students 'we care'. You add in cases where the school has to deal with rules around privacy, liability, and campus security and there is a significant imbalance. Add in that research shows a huge disparity between the impact of faculty caring about students and the impact of faculty effectively communicating that caring and...well it's a mess. I know a lot of cases where faculty do things *specifically* because they care, but that caring is lost or viewed very differently by students because of generational differences, cultural norms, or just not understanding another perspective. I wish I could share examples.

Nationwide, student mental health is an issue that is gaining a lot of attention - and I think most students end up feeling like their schools are slightly behind the curve. It's a difference of detail and reporting, the good and the bad get reported and we all draw our own conclusions based on our perspective and experience. If GT can't provide details on specific cases, it can be hard to cognitively separate that from them not knowing or caring. It's like the reverse of 'everyone hates congress except for their representative'.

Added in, and the thing I think the students who cares about this issue could do, is that the students themselves can help. The student population here (note, I'm somewhat new) seems to be both deeply concerned about this issue, but yet not quite able to let it go as part of their identity. We might see a class of 100 for four hours a week - it's hard to know when students are struggling. You guys see your friends. I'm not trying to shift blame, but I'm encouraging there to be more agency from GT students to help each other out. because GT could make infinite resources available (and I really wish they could) but that might only help the most acute cases or make a dent in a few students already experiencing stress. I truly believe that GT can't change the student culture of GT - they can only create safety fences. You see each other a lot more and are a huge source of socializing students into GT's culture of 'shared despair.' That is transferred student to student. Explicitly and implicitly, you communicate about value and choices to each other.

Not saying it's perfect or even good or that you are wrong...just saying it's complex. Some departments are better or worse (I have my own opinions), some of it comes from the students some from faculty some from the nature of the world. We do care, and a small step for everyone in our community is probably a little bit of assuming [positive intent](https://www.forbes.com/sites/entrepreneursorganization/2017/08/15/the-hidden-power-of-assuming-positive-intent/) ",Neutral,"student mental health, faculty care, campus culture, communication, student responsibility",11,2019-01-18

You’re gonna find racism just about everywhere in America but Atlanta is much more progressive than a lot of the rural south (and probably most of the country in general if I had to guess). There’s people of all nationalities here and the overall culture isn’t racist, but you may encounter racist individuals. 

I’ve also never noticed gun control being a problem. I’ve been living in the Atlanta area my whole life and have rarely seen someone walking around toting a gun that wasn’t a police officer. 

The media plays up political divisiveness in this country. You could easily go to school here and avoid any sort of political debate if you wanted to.

You are very much overestimating the amount of education these criminals have. All you have to do is mildly drop a rumor that GT students are going to be strapped, and they'll easily believe that every single one of us is packing until told otherwise. 

From the accounts I've heard about these criminals, they barely know how technology works, much less the ins-and-outs of the Georgia legal system. 


&gt; robbing people who are clearly freshmen is still low-hanging fruit

What's more, that assertion is pretty wrong; most of the muggings on campus took place in Home Park, a location where you are **very** unlikely to run into any freshmen. You're actually far more likely to run into people over the age of 21 in that location, more so than any other part of campus, as graduate students and the oldest upperclassmen seem to have a strong predilection for how little it costs to live there.

When you get right down to it, actually quantifying the impact that campus carry has had is going to be functionally impossible, because incidents are very likely not going to be reported. I've heard second-hand accounts of people flashing would-be criminals their firearms, and the criminals immediately backing off – that's the most likely scenario by far, and the one that is going to be most difficult to actually quantify.

comment,"I won’t lie to you - racism, gun violence and backwards political opinions certainly exist. But that doesn’t mean they are normal or really all that prevalent in most places.

Atlanta is really a pretty progressive city and is quite liberal politically, though the same can not be said for the surrounding areas. So you are not likely to run into any extreme racism or racially motivated violence while you are here. That said, you will more than likely meet someone who makes you feel unwelcome due to your race at some point, particularly if you venture outside of the city. This is unfortunate, but try to ignore it and not to let their ignorance get to you.

As for concerns about gun violence, it’s true that it is more common than in other countries, but it’s actually rare that someone just gets shot with no motivation other than violence. Those are just the cases you hear about a lot because they are so incredibly tragic. But really as long as you don’t go anywhere too dangerous you should be fine. Ask someone if you are unsure. Occasionally armed robberies occur around campus which is scary, but really no one gets hurt in these scenarios as long as they cooperate (your life is more important than your stuff).

That's not to say definitively that it isn't a deterrent, just that there's obviously insufficient evidence and factors which suggest the opposite is true.

Monday is MLK day, a federal holiday in the United States. In order for the dining halls to be open, workers would then have to abandon attending service and meetings in honor of Dr. King in order to make you food because you’re not capable of sustaining yourself otherwise. Saturday- Monday, the largest service in the US is held for Dr. King at Ebeneezer Baptist church, located about 12 minutes from Tech, where Dr. King was a pastor. For the black community, this is an annual event that usually consumes the weekend at various locations throughout the US. In 1983, The US government decided that upholding this weekend of remembrance was more important that keeping open banks, schools, etc, and because Dr King stood for equality of all people, not just black, it only made sense to relieve all nonessential workers of duty so that they can reflect on the country’s history. For you to cry about a lack of dining workers keeping the halls open all day, directly suggests that their values are not important enough to warrant you not getting your hamburger and slice of pizza. Here’s an equation that should make it pretty plain.

This is Atlanta.  There is mass transit, the stingerette, a GT club which will help you get a cheap bike.  If kroger is impossible to get to (because of no car) then walk thee to the MARTA station and hit up a supermarket near one of those stations.

Limited access is not no access.   We frown on students who are too single-minded in their focus and forget things like bathing, washing clothes, or other bits that make up everyday life.    Not keeping ramen noodles, sandwich bread, or a few cans of food in your dorm for when the meal hall is closed (or spare cash for such type of emergency) is a faux pas in a similar vein.     

Its not as if the school schedule isn't decided and published months ahead of time.   Sorry man.... the onus is on every individual to plan or make arrangements to manage the deficiencies in the resources or opportunities that they rely upon to survive.

If you're leaning so hard on the institute that you can't even feed yourself for a day or 2 then that is a life lesson that you're failing at pretty hard, IMO.

comment,"They're definitely not good. Just how bad they are varies depending on who you ask, though. The biggest source of complaints against Dining comes from the Freshman Experience mandatory meal plans. These things are the biggest ripoffs in existence: most students lose hundreds or even thousands a year in unused extraneous swipes they force you to buy.

Luckily, everyone just ignores the dining halls after their first year. People just eat retail (on or off campus) or cook at home.

Edit: here's a more in-depth response to this question I've given before:

&gt;The reasons people complain about the dining halls are myriad. First, if you enroll in Freshman Experience, you'll be automatically billed $2,500/semester your first year for a few hundred meal swipes. Unless you spend all day going to the dining halls, you'll never use anywhere near that number of swipes, so you lose hundreds or thousands over a year to unused swipes. If you used every swipe, the cost per meal isn't that bad, but it's outrageous factoring in unused swipes.

&gt;Furthermore, the halls often operate on schedules that almost feel like they're designed to prevent students from using them to maximum efficiency. People have found dirt/bugs/metal/etc in food multiple times. Many stations/machines are often not making food/broken. Plates/bowls/utensils are often not properly washed.

&gt;I could go on and on. The thing is: the freshmen are a captive market. Nobody other than them buys swipes, so pressure on the dining halls remains relatively low across campus, as it only affects a group that is forced to spend large amounts of money on the plans.",Negative,"dining, freshman experience, meal plans, complaints, ripoffs, unused swipes, retail, cooking, billing, cost, efficiency, sanitation, market, pressure.",11,2019-01-20

It looks like your data is actually mostly correct on the y-axis, it's just scaled by a factor of 1000 (divide your y-axis values or multiply your run data by 1000 and it matches the data) - there's an option to turn off automatic scaling in the chart design options. There are some strange things occurring with your first few data points being so close to zero, so you might also have a case where your decimal points are being recognized as commas (which happens often in other localities set in Excel), so check for that as well. Try retyping the values manually if you copy-pasted them from somewhere else.

Your x-axis isn't formatting your time values properly; it's simply plotting their indices (1 to 17) instead of their actual values (that is, the first value is 1, the second is 2, the third is 3, and so on).

This usually happens when your time values are formatted as text rather than numbers. Select that column, right click, and hit format cells. From there, change the value to ""Numbers"" and it should recognize them as the proper values that they are.

- always ask questions like “what would you suggest?” Or “what strategies do you adopt in those situations?” If they were giving out criticism. 
- selective listening is an important skill
I know these might seem like things that make you look like you’re conceding, but sadly being head on,  and straight to the point, and even calling those people out on their attitudes, is often mistaken with being confrontational so you have to be soft to get the job done.

To hear you tell it, the food sucks and it isn't' available all the times that it should be to make grabbing a meal convenient.

Fair enough, but those are two problems with clear avenues of mitigation.   The food hall not being open on holidays is hardly an unforeseen or unexpected issue.   Even if it were, just a little bit of planning or effort (maybe 1-2 hours and $5-$20) on your part would make the inconvenience a non-issue.  As problems go, that is a *really* easy fix and well within the capabilities of anyone with access to enough resources to live on campus, attend college and have a meal plan.    If an extra $10-$20 a month to make sure you have enough food for holidays is too much of a burden then you have far more pressing issues than whether or not Woodies is open on President's day.  

Leaving home to go live on campus comes with the understanding that students will have to take on more of the tasks and responsibilities of taking care of themselves.  Feeding oneself falls squarely into that category, as it is one of the most basic daily needs that we all have.  IMO, I don't think its too much to ask of any able bodied student to figure out how to do it everyone once in a blue (or blood in this case, i suppose) moon.

As for the quality of the food, I don't see how that factors into the issue of the meal hall's calendar, or my implication that students living in the dorms shouldn't go hungry for a day if Brittain is closed.

Most of you are engineers in training and are routinely asked to solve more difficult problems than this multiple times per day.   I've having a hard time understanding the reticence over what is a pretty easy fix.","Negative

Parking is/was a scam long before I got there and will be as long as cars need to be parked by humans.   As far as campus services goes... you're kind of up a creek, at least temporarily.  You can't vote with your dollar as a freshman,  but there are indirect methods...you can write and communicate;  bad reviews, critical posts (like this one) and warning prospective students about how bad the food is.  None of which have a direct effect on the bottom line, but the inertia of which might factor into future decisions if enough noise gets made.

Echo, which is in Suwanee so a bit further, is also pretty decent - better sound quality than Gangnam Style and Happy at least.

Most people don't realize how terribly inaccurate handguns are, and most criminals don't spend much if any time at the range learning how to use them properly. 

Also, taking a hit from a pistol will very rarely kill you outright unless they get you in a vital region, and you'll usually have several minutes before you lose enough blood to where you're in real trouble. And since pistols are loud, they're announcing themselves to any nearby bystanders and authorities, after which time they basically have to run anyway and don't have time to deal with you, so they're disincentivized to shoot in the first place unless you're in a very bad area of town.

They're so ridiculously inaccurate that the only way you could hurt someone with them is by firing into a tightly-packed crowd.

Depends very much on the situation and how you're carrying. Typically, you want to look for a window of distraction, then take advantage of it; dropping your wallet onto the ground is the first one I can think of. It's all very situation specific, but you have to use common sense. 

For instance, if you're a woman, you may want to carry a revolver in your purse; that way, if someone tries to mug you, you can simply reach into it as if for your billfold, then shoot them through the purse. 

Carrying a weapon is by no means a panacea, but if you're trained properly, you certainly stand a better chance than your average citizen.

Most importantly, we would like students to know we in no way are trying to engage in some sort of clandestine behavioral engineering to change their pre-existing study habits (I can’t believe I even have to type this, but here we are). Instead, the building design reflects trends in where education is headed according to the research and findings of numerous sources, including the first-hand research we conducted with partners. We knew it would be decades before these buildings would be renovated (for perspective, Price Gilbert was built in 1953, the graduate addition in 1968), so we committed to a concept of “long life, loose fit.”

We understand the building, it’s layout and it’s furniture may be different from what you are used to — and in many ways that means we did our job. We set out to create a new model of what a research library could be — a new model that can recreated across STEM higher education. The problem, of course, is that we can’t be all things to all people — as reflected by these posts. 

That said, we’re meeting with students to try and make sure we bring in as much input as possible so that our continued direction doesn’t engender resentment. Believe it or not, we’re always open to meeting and taking your comments. We can’t promise immediate action, but we can promise your feedback is duly considered and thoughtfully discussed.

Honestly, I can’t believe I’m having to explain to someone who wants to portray how well versed they are in this issue that it’s not the collaborative spaces in general that have an inherent problem. It’s the lack of balance between collaborative and non-collaborative spaces. At least give us the autonomy to choose.

We have a set amount of money and resources, and we have to serve as many students as best as possible. Why not join us — with other students — so your voice can be heard?

comment,"I am from Waterloo and am on faculty at Tech (not CS, though) so maybe I can help.

First, both are great schools with a strong and long history in CS, along with a good reputation in industry, so either one will likely lead to decent job opportunities for you. As a result, my recommendation is that you consider the following as you make your decision:

* What strand of CS are you most interested in pursuing? Look closely at the related course requirements and faculty research interests, and see which is a better fit.
* Do you have a preference for where you might end up living and working upon graduation? Other than west coast usa jobs, GT will more likely feed into american jobs and UW will more likely feed into Canadian jobs.
* Keep the cost of living and tuition costs in mind. Since both will lead to great opportunities, which one will lead to less debt? (Also, remember that you'll have to pay for stuff like visits to the doctor, because the american health care system is dumb)
* Did you complete your undergrad at one or the other? If so, I'd recommend selecting the other one, to maximize your exposure to new stuff
* How is your tolerance for crazy politicians and republican shenanigans? Rob and Doug Ford ain't got nothin' on our governor... When I first moved to the US for graduate school I actually really appreciated the opportunity to get an insider's look at American culture, and gain some insight into what makes Canada's underpants tick. But down South in Georgia they really have their special moments...

The coverage usually also covers getting mugged on the street, so if you don't already have one, you probably should look into getting one especially if you live on or around campus (you may even get a discount on premium if you bundle with auto insurance, and even without discount, most policy costs under 30 a month.

You can get one for just about any residence.

comment,"This isn’t a dumb question at all!!! Joining clubs seems to be a common recommendation but my mentality is that just because you like the same activities as certain people, that doesn’t mean you’re going to click with them on a deeper level. It’s probably more convenient, though, kind of like how it’s more convenient to have a short-distance relationship as opposed to a long-distance one. Also, we could get really into some social psychology stuff here but I’ll spare you, lol. 

I’d say grab a study partner and then make an effort to get to know him/her. It sounds similar to the club suggestion, but I think the difference is that there’s more effort involved in the end, because you might not see each other again the next semester, unless you genuinely want to. Maybe they are or aren’t in the same boat, but are open to a friendship and maintaining it if you both click enough. I will say that one of you will have to step forward and make plans outside of studying so that it doesn’t become a “study buddy with no strings attached” relationship. “By any chance, would you X?” is a good way to initiate a plan.

Folks *really* need to read the owner's manual for their vehicle at least once.  Not knowing how the alarm works, where their spare is (or even if they have a spare), and other simple stuff is unfortunately not common knowledge.

EDIT to add:

Somewhat related, I hate automatic convenience features where the default is ""on,"" such as lights or beeps for every key fob press, automatic ""on"" lights when the vehicle is unlocked (or put into park), and automatic unlocking when the vehicle is put into park (I consider the last one in particular to be a safety issue -- you should observe your surroundings before unlocking).

One disadvantage you'll have as an AE is at the career fair some (uninformed) recruiters will only hire MEs even though it's some CAD work that either major has the same qualifications for. It's also perhaps more difficult to switch out of AE into ME as opposed to the other way around, and many jobs in the aerospace industry can and are held by ME backgrounds.",Neutral,"academic programs, career advancement, aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, recruiting, industry.",11,2019-01-24

I have asked literally everybody about this, and the general consensus that I came to (could be wrong, so take it with a grain of salt) is that, especially as a first and second year, it is easier to get internships as a mechanical engineering major. Many aerospace companies look for a lot of relevant experience before you can get an internship there. What I am doing right now is sticking with mechanical my first year, trying to get an internship that gives me SOME experience somewhere, then switching to AE major next year so I have similar experience I can use as leverage in AE internship interviews. That is my plan, many people have other plans and change their mind all the time so don't force yourself to stay with any one thing just because you convinced yourself that you liked it in high school. Try new things and talk to people about a variety of different careers and majors. Also, if you are super interested in research in specific AE labs, you don't necessarily have to be an AE to participate. I have friends who are Chem Engineering doing research with bio teams, etc. You don't need to be majoring in the exact same thing you are doing research on, especially when AE and ME are so similar at the fundamental level (I think.

Both industries are more on the ""Aerospace"" side of things, and I would say I saw/met more ME's than I did AE's. ME is super versatile and gives you a lot of options, so it's good for people who want to be flexible or aren't sure where they want to go.

That being said, if you are confident that you will have no regrets sticking only to Aerospace-related industries, then I don't see why sticking to AE is a bad idea, especially if it's your passion. I think if you get involved heavily in the AE school, and learn to sell yourself at career fairs, then you shouldn't have than many issues getting internships or a job. You just have to emphasize the skills in CAD, design, ect that ME are generally known for.

Now, if there was evidence that they were followed from campus, or targeted based on the fact that they were GT students, then that would've been a different story, but honestly there was no reason for the media to even report that it was ""four GT students"" vs. ""four random people"" in the story anyway.

1. Try putting yourself out there first.  The more you do it, the more you get used to it.  Do things outside of your comfort zone, like get up to write on the board or ask questions out loud.  Make friends with the people around you so you feel like you have a support group, etc.
2. If its REALLY bad, have your doctor check you out for anxiety.  Its a common issue and easily treatable with therapy/meds.  I personally am on anti-anxiety meds and it has made a world of difference (after a weird trial period finding the right dosage).

comment,"&gt;Thing is, looking at the mechanical engineering curriculum, some of the classes simply don’t excite me the way the AE ones do. Also, I’m more interested in the AE research labs and facilities compared to the ME ones.

It seems like you're more passionate about aerospace, so I think you're good sticking with that.  As for research, ME and AE are relatively similar (compared to other engineering disciplines), so I think you could be a AE major and do research with an ME professor or vice versa.  Some groups may want an interdisciplinary team.  I don't think you'd limit yourself one way or another.

Another thing - [ME](http://www.me.gatech.edu/undergraduate/bsms) and [AE](https://aerospace.gatech.edu/bs-ms-honors-program) both have BS/MS programs where you can get apply to their respective graduate programs (ME's apply for the ME one, AE's for the AE one) if you meet a certain GPA requirement without taking the GRE.  For ME, it's not binding if you get accepted, but I don't know about AE.  You might want to look into that, especially if you think you'd want to stay at Tech.

I suggest taking the first AE-specific class as soon as you can (edit: and also ME 1770 to learn CAD).  Hopefully, it'll help you confirm AE is right for you.  Also, I've heard from AE friends that there are lots of classes that are taken in sequence, and starting that soon will help you stay on track (assuming you'll graduate in 4 years).  If you're still unsure about it, there's a freshmen COE 1000 class that overviews all the engineering majors.

You may hate everything and realize space is not for you - or you may discover you enjoy operations or systems design and can suddenly apply that experience to many different industries. Because your undergrad degree ultimately doesn’t matter as long as it says engineer in the end,  I suggest you use it to check through everything that covers space to find the thing you like.

comment,"If you are interested in more events like this for similar causes, definitely encourage people to bring funding bills to SGA! A big part of our role is funding events and clubs on campus. This one specifically came to SGA from the African American Student Union.  

Our Cultural and Diversity Affairs Committee is working on more events to promote inclusivity of all- if you'd like, I would be happy to provide the contact info of the committee chairs or pass along suggestions for events on campus. They're currently working on a brown bag series. Here's the info I was given for that:

""An informal discussion series covering a range of topics including women in stem, interfaith, privilege, advocacy, and sexual assault. These events are open to all and are conducted as open forums for discussion, with panels from various organizations that weigh in on the topic and provide their insight such as WST, GTIA, and Disability Services. ""

On top of this, they are working on getting ASL classes added to GT's curriculum as a humanities credit. They are also working on an Inclusivity Conference to be held in April. Here's the info I have on that so far:

""The Inclusivity Conference will be held in April of 2019 and will focus on developing and enabling leaders who practice inclusivity, promote diversity, and establish protected environments. We hope to have this event be a collaboration with leaders from multiple different organizations on campus presenting on their journeys, have students engage in workshops and activities, and conclude with reflections from keynote speakers and administration involved in student life. ""

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or would like to get in contact with our CDAC Committee! We fully support the idea of hosting more events that will make everyone feel included and represented and would love your input. I'll also talk with them and see if they have any plans for specific months in the future.",Positive,"events, funding, campus, inclusivity, diversity, committees, women in stem, interfaith, privilege, advocacy, sexual assault, asl classes, humanities, inclusivity conference, leaders, workshops, activities, keynote speakers,",9,2019-01-25

comment,"If you don’t qualify for need based financial aid, there’s not a whole lot. The stamps presidential scholarship covers everything but very few people get it and it’s a real crap shoot. I think all applicants are automatically entered into the pool for that. 

I’d try to find some scholarships from you local area. A lot of times there will be scholarships that are just for people from your high school or town. These can be easier to get since I’m guessing you’re kind of a big fish in a small pond but when you come to GT that pond gets a whole lot bigger.

Unfortunately, most out of state students do have to pay a significant amount and there’s not really a way around that. That said, you do kind of get what you pay for when it comes to college at least to some extent, so it may be worth it to take out some student loans and end up with a really valuable degree.

Georgia Tech is also notorious for releasing financial aid award letters extremely late. I believe they are late March/early April for Freshman and after that it can go as late as July.

We had many spaces, many quite spaces, many noisy spaces, many spacious bathrooms, many spaces with cubicles, many spaces without cubicles, nice staff and many books which make it look like a real library etc. For now, I do think the lib looks like a fancy learning common/cafe versus a library.

comment,"I wouldn't worry too much about the career fairs. Every company I've ever worked for uses career fairs to fill entry level jobs that nobody really wants (usually lots of technical busy work). For other jobs they typically utilize online job sites, LinkedIn, or recruiters. 

I also wouldn't worry too much about a lower GPA because most places will ignore it after they see you graduated from GT. I've been involved with interviewing and hiring several engineers and I almost never look at GPA because it doesn't tell me anything about how you solve problems, how you interact with people, or how you work under pressure.

My suggestion would be to work on your resume and interview skills. For reference, here are a few mistakes I see people make:

* Don't list your school courses as experience. Everyone took the same classes so we don't care. Don't fluff your resume with useless information!

* Don't list skills if you don't have them. I once interviewed a test engineer who had claimed he had ""extensive SQL database experience"" which was complete bull shit. Turns out he couldn't answer fundamental questions about database design or write a valid SQL query. I probably don't have to tell you he didn't get the job...

* List hobbies that are related to your major. Did you build a dune buggy in your garage? Write a program to automate something? Like to build electronic do-dads in your spare time? Rebuilt the engine in your car? List all of these! These are the things that interviewers love to talk to you about and the things that are most likely to get you an entry level job.

* Don't be afraid to list failures as long as you learned from them. It's ok to mention that your design project failed miserably if you know why it failed and can explain what you would do differently to prevent the failure.

* List hobbies that are not related to your major if they show creativity, problem solving, how you handle pressure, or that you finish what you start. This includes sports, playing a musical instrument, or artwork.

* List any previous job where you have had to lead, manage, or deal with difficult people. I won't care that you stocked groceries but if you routinely dealt with pissed off customers at the local auto parts store, I want to hear about it.

* Show that you have a passion for learning new things. We once hired a guy because he had an obvious passion for learning and spent most of his free time taking free classes online, teaching himself new software, or reading books. This turned out to be a great decision because the guy learns everything on his own very quickly. I would much rather hire an engineer where I only need to give a direction over an engineer that I need to do constant hand holding because they can't figure things out on their own.

* Don't rehearse for your interview. Its ok to research questions and think about what you are going to say, but don't rehearse to the point that you sound scripted. Interviewers will pick up on this quickly and assume you aren't telling the truth.

* If you don't know the answer to a question, don't bull shit it. I would rather you say something like ""I don't have the experience to answer that question"" than to tell me some bull shit story that you won't remember 15 minutes later when a probe for more details.

* I know it is difficult to feel relaxed during an interview, but try to relax and open up a bit. Basically, a good interview becomes less of drilling you with questions and more of a casual conversation.

* Don't talk just to fill silence. I once interviewed a guy that tried to fill every silence with talking to the point the interviewers couldn't get any questions in. About 15 minutes into the interview everyone gave up on asking questions and we ended the interview. Some times times interviewers just need a short silence to get their thoughts together so just relax and go with it.

The only other advice I can think of at the moment is to be careful of recruiters that contact you by e-mail. There are many recruiters that like to use a shady tactic where they send several job descriptions in a bulk e-mail in hopes that people will be interested in at least one of the jobs and reply to the e-mail. When the applicant responds the recruiter will string them along and get them an interview for an entry level job that is unrelated to the job they really wanted. My recommendation is to only talk to a recruiter if they phone you directly or you are confident that they e-mailed you directly for a specific job.",Neutral,"career advice.

comment,"Also had it with Simpkins last semester. I agree with all of this.

My tip for succeeding in the class would be to not focus on the specific implementations shown in lecture or on the practice tests (still do them), but rather put your energy into making sure you understand everything conceptually (while still knowing how to implement it) so that you can apply it on the exams. CS is very, very applied and you won't succeed by memorizing raw information (code from examples/the internet). This will only become more important in later courses.

As cliched as it may be, read the language documentation. Everything you'll do in Java has great documentation online. Read it all. People's biggest mistake in these kinds of CS classes is jumbling together piecemeal code without understanding what they're trying to use the language's features for and why. This is especially huge in 1331.

Utilize Piazza! The TAs are great and very responsive, and the other students in the class tend to also answer a ton of questions (I try to check at least once a day and answer as many as I can). Do NOT be afraid to ask for help. I guarantee you you'll never be the only person struggling to understand something.",Positive,tips for success in cs class,4,2019-01-26

I know I won't change their mind, but I don't see myself walking into The Canteen very often anymore.  I've spent over $2,000 at The Canteen since it opened and much of that was at TGM.  Looks like it's time to get a proper coffee maker for the office.  RIP the amazing hot chocolate and pumpernickel bagels with plain schmear, capers, and smoked salmon.  Best $15 I ever spent.

But the soft skills that it takes to set yourself apart and get the jobs you want are hugely important as well. Since some engineers also excel in those areas it can seem like Scheller is just a place for athletes to get easy grades. But they (edit: Scheller, not the athletes) honestly do a good job of forcing you to practice and build those skills if you take advantage of it, and also give you a metric TON of career development advice which makes it so much easier to “game the system” of the job hunt.

Do keep in mind too that as you go along in your degree you will be spending more and more time in Scheller, so the majority of your friends may end up being people from there anyways.

comment,"I'm currently a 4th year student in Scheller with an ITM concentration. I'm also doing a CS minor so I have plenty of experience in both areas. 
Yes Scheller for me is easier than CS, but no I don't get made fun of by my peers. Even my friends in CS don't make many jokes because 1. I'm taking the same hard ass classes as they are, and 2. I take pride in being an ITM student. And that's what I'd recommend for you as well, whatever you do at Tech, take pride in and have confidence in it. People don't make fun of students who genuinely like what they do and take pride in their craft. 
Just don't complain about how hard your homework is to a CS/engineering major. It doesn't compare lol",Neutral,"student, scheller, itm, cs, peers, friends, classes, pride, confidence, craft, homework.",5,2019-01-27

Also, as far as ITM, was it easy to find internships/a full time job? I think it's the direction I want to go, instead of CS, because I don't really enjoy traditional software engineering/development - but, I'm a bit worried that I'll be pigeonholed into general business roles because companies will just see that I have a BSBA.

comment,"1. It's a really good mix. I'd have to review the numbers to give an accurate percentage cut. Neither group seems to be a sore outlier anymore. Students are increasingly choosing Scheller off the bat / like your scenario!

2. Yeah! We have opportunities with every industry. Also, pro tip - attend the CoC (College of Computing) career fair if you're interested in true tech companies as a business intelligence analyst, project manager role, etc. As for recruiting at Scheller, the administration loves information sessions and morning tabling with companies. Gives students an opportunity to one-on-one with recruiters. Also, professors will invite their industry buddies to speak at class and those people want to see students!!!

3. Lastly, you won't be pigeonholed here. Scheller students have the opportunity to be as broad or as niche in their concentration as they want to be. A few opportunities from friends that I can think of are... BI analyst @ boeing, management consulting @ a Big4, software dev @ Amazon. These are Scheller students with a ITM concentration.

comment,"I want to echo was this guy (or lady) said.  Back when I first set foot on campus 20 years ago, the business majors were “dummies” and thought of as people who couldn’t cut it in engineering.  Being the impressionable young adult I was, I majored in Mechanical Engineering and while that degree has opened doors for me, I know I would have been much better served in my career by majoring in business.  I know for a fact that the reputation for majoring in business is better now, but I am here to tell you to not care what other people think and do what interests you.  You will be the one laughing in 10 years when you have progressed further, make more money, and have had more fun in your career than the engineers.  I recently went back to school in the evening MBA program at Scheller to get a formal business degree so that I can advance further in my career.   


Something else that you may want to consider is the ISYE program.  It is an engineering major, but is more based on business processes, simulations, etc as opposed to designing equipment.  Beware, though, people that major in ISYE are called IE for “industrial engineer”, but the smartass electrical and mechanical engineering students at Georgia Tech will call you an “Imaginary Engineer”. And like I mentioned before, you just gotta stay strong and not care about what people think!   (Which is actually just good advice about life in general).  


That being said, we’d love to have you in Atlanta at Georgia Tech.  Have you done any campus tours or visited Atlanta?  I don’t know what other schools you are considering, but this is your opportunity to live in the best neighborhood (Midtown) in the heart of a major American city and study at a very prestigious school.  If you are sticking to the Southeast, I can’t think of any other schools offer that combination.  

DM me if you have more questions.

comment,"Hello! I’m in the Honors Program, so I’ll tell you about that. We’re a LLC that’s focused on multidisciplinary thought. The classes offered reflect that, with lots of classes that mix disciplines; chemistry class with a Public Policy TA, Economics taking a visit to the Fox Theater, etc. The goal is that you and your peers should be able to not only learn material, but learn to apply it to whatever situation in real life that it would make sense to do so. 

The people of the Honors Program are ultra diverse in thought and passions due to the multidisciplinary theme. Lots of involvement in the greater GT community in general. 

Fun perk: we’re the only LLC with a specific study abroad (at least I think, maybe Global Leadership has one). The Oxford Program is 6 weeks traveling around Europe with professors, and 6 weeks in Oxford learning from HP professors.

Glenn and Towers are the most recently renovated ones on East Campus, and all of them on West (except Woodruff) are fairly similar. If I had to pick the best ones on West, they’d probably be Montag and Freeman. 

If you’re wondering if East or West Campus is better, that’s all personal preference. West is close to West Village, the CRC, mechanical engineering buildings, the Instructional Center, and Cook Out. There are more trees and it’s a little quieter. East is close to the stadium, Greek houses (though several of us on West are Greek), the library, I-75/85, and the Varsity.

comment,"So - I can't speak to the counseling center practices or it's resources (read: we all know they're abysmal), in the meantime I recommend the following. 

1) National Suicide Prevention Lifeline; Call 1-800-273-8255. They are open 24/7

2) GT has an on call counselor by phone 24/7 also - I've used them before. Please call 404-894-2575; You can also get GTPD via this line if you prefer. 

3) Georgia Crisis and Access line: If you are in need of immediate assistance please contact the [Georgia Crisis and Access Line](https://www.valueoptions.com/referralconnect/doLogin.do?e=Z2FjbSAg) (GCAL) 1-800-715-4225 

4) Often untapped option - what do you parents do for work? I suggest you google their company + ""EAP"" or ""employee assistance program"". Traditionally benefits are extended to dependents (regardless of if you're on their health insurance or your age). An EAP should also have a 24/7 line where you can speak to someone and they typically pay for 5-10 counseling sessions per issue per year. ie, they could pay for sessions if you got divorced, and then again if your cat died, etc. Short term solution, but it does give you affordable access to outside counseling. Not that you'll necessarily get in any faster than nine days, but it's possible. What I've done in the past is had the EAP identify three counselors for me and I looked up to see if any were in network of my insurance. I picked ones that were, got my 5-10 free sessions and then started paying once I had exhausted that.

Honestly, I wouldn’t worry about salaries. Though the finance concentration may seem to have a higher starting salary, that’s because most people working in that area are going to be working in places like California and New York. They may be making more, but after taking high cost of living into account it’s going to be essentially the same across the board.
I’ve had a great experience as a strategy concentration. My classes are extremely interesting and fun, and it’s something that can be applied to a lot of fields.

comment,"I have a Wowgo 2S with I think the 6.4Ah battery. It's served me quite well so far, especially since it was less than $400. The newer models have replaceable wheels in the back as well, so you don't have to replace the motor when the wheel gets worn. It's a very easy board to learn with, as personally the accelerate-brake control makes more intuitive sense than the forward-reverse on the boosted, and it has three speed modes and a smooth ESC.",Positive,electric skateboard,2,2019-01-28

However, if you paid taxes, odds are your withholding was incorrect (almost nobody's is completely accurate) and you overpaid. This means you should file because you'll get the money you overpaid back! Depending on your exact circumstances (unearned income and the like), you might be entitled to all of the withheld income taxes you paid. It should be noted that you will not get back the FICA (SS/Medicare) taxes you paid regardless.

You should file using software from the IRS [Free File program](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free). Many of the major software vendors (eg TurboTax) participate in it, but make sure you originate the process through the IRS Free File website rather than the vendor directly from Google, as some of them have watered down free versions that aren't Free File that they'll trick you into using if you don't originate from the IRS site.

It's a very straightforward process and the software will walk you through everything step-by-step and let you e-file at the end. One thing you might not realize since it's your first time filing: any interest earned from bank accounts fully in your name and profits from securities trades are income and must be reported on your taxes. Your institutions should give you (either online or through the mail) a Form 1099 that will make that process relatively painless.",Neutral,"tax filing, software, irs free file program, income reporting.",6,2019-01-29

So don’t think that people telling you what they think of your work is them being judgmental, rather it’s them giving their input and telling you what they think of your design!

Interaction is a big part of ID and without it, it’s very hard to get feedback on your designs without talking to people, but it shouldn’t be affecting your physical and mental health.

comment,"As an ID upperclassman, I can understand the way you felt. I felt that way during my first year too. I’ll split up my advice into parts:

1. The workload - it’s a lot. And it sucks. You’re probably trying to balance 7 classes at once and it’s hard. It gets better though. Later on, you get more adjusted to the workload and you get more credit for your classes (ID classes are worth 3 hours as opposed to a 1 hour class) so it’s more manageable. Plus, when you get deeper into the content, it gets more interesting and you realize why you did all the busy work you did freshman year. I would say freshman studio is a weed-out year because it really tests us to see if we’re enjoying the material enough to stick around. I, like you, wanted to drop and I’m so glad I didn’t. There are many people who dropped and are so glad they did. It depends on the person.

2. Cliquey-ness. There are still some cliques in studio in my year. When you have 70 people spending so much time together in one room, cliques happen. There’s some I like, some I don’t like. I felt lost my freshman year, but I’ve found some really great friends in ID since. What I like the most is that people are willing to help you, even if you don’t know them well. I know it’s hard, but a possible solution could be to be the change yourself. Maybe ask some people if they wanna grab lunch after sketching and modeling and before studio. Better yet, ask a general “does anybody wanna get Chickfila before studio?” I guarantee you’ll get some answers. I made friends just by walking to lunch together freshman year. I was shy, too, but once you break that barrier (you can do it!!!) it gets so much easier!

3. Mental health- I had so many breakdowns my freshman year, it’s crazy. I’m not saying it’s normal, though. My biggest regret is not getting help for it. I ranted with my friends a lot, but getting 3 hours of sleep several nights a week was so bad for my health, and it affected the way I saw myself. My biggest piece of advice is to take care of yourself. Do this first. It’s okay if you don’t have straight A’s. Hell, my grades were horrible freshman year. I still got internships, despite being below the average Tech GPA. Get some sleep, and make an appointment with the counseling center. Everyone talks a lot of crap about them, but I found it really helpful to talk to an unbiased person about my experience. You won’t get an appointment right away, though so I’d suggest scheduling one soon if you’re interested. Also, don’t forget the importance of healthy eating and exercise! Even if that 600 calorie jumbo honey bun is staring at you from the vending machine at 3am, it’s best to reach for the granola bar or the trail mix. What’s even better is choosing to get some sleep, even if it means taking an L.


If you ever want any more advice or just want someone to talk to who “gets it”, feel free to DM me whenever. I’d be happy to help. :) best of luck!!","Positive

comment,"To answer your other question first, BMED 2210 being moved up as one of (if not the first) classes you take I think was the stupidest thing this curriculum ever did. It's a blatant weed out attempt, but I think it fails because as you say, it's so poorly taught. I think the material is quite challenging and you need to problem solve in ways you might not have yet. I think it's a poor first choice of course and I'd encourage you to not let it define how you think about the whole major. 


&gt; I found out that apparently it is more challenging for BME majors to find jobs or internships compared to other engineering majors (ME, EE, ChemE), and if I want to do work in biomechanics, ME is probably a better option. Is it true that job prospects for BME majors are much narrower than that of ME majors?

I might be jaded, but I've never agreed with this. BME's face more criticism about being an inch deep and mile wide, but I never had issues finding internships or full time employment. You have to be clever about how you market yourself and what you go after, but that's true about any major I also think. 

There's a whole office in the bme first floor with a person dedicated to helping your career. Sally Gerrish when she was there was a fantastic force of nature, I forget who has replaced her but I've worked with her also and I think she's great too. 

In general I would skip the major general career fair. I'd focus on the biotech career fair. Apply online, en mass, and also look for research opportunities on campus with professors who own small companies and other small companies in Atlanta in general. We have a mutli million dollar ATDC on campus also. 

Minoring in CS will absolutely help - I know a few BME's with CS minors who have gone on to work for places like Epic or other medical software groups. 

If you want the biological basis to understand prosthesis or how the body works, stick as BME. Take mechanically inclined courses. I think you miss the anatomy and biology / physiology if you skip out on BME for just ME. 

Feel free to PM me. ",Neutral,"education, career, bme, biomechanics, internships, job prospects, marketability, career fair, biotech, research, cs minor, prosthesis, anatomy, biology, physiology.",10,2019-01-30
comment,"You're going to get a wide variety of answers among BMEs, even among the BMEs who are in industry. To give a kind of cop out answer, the answer to ""Do BMEs get jobs?"" is one that lies in the middle on a spectrum. Yes BME grads do get jobs, but a lot of the jobs aren't necessarily the ""glamorous"" engineering jobs that a ton of people dream about. That's not necessarily something that's a bad thing, but it is something that I think the department should be a bit more upfront on. A major source of jobs used to come from St. Jude Medical/Abbott hiring BMEs to become field service engineers, which is really more of a hybrid between sales and technical skills (promotion pathway is through sales). There's going to be a bunch of BMEs who disagree with my assessments, but there are a lot of people in industry (not necessarily all BMEs) that will agree with me. 
 
 
When you say you want to work with prosthetics or medical devices (which is extremely broad of an industry, btw), are you essentially saying that you want to get into design or R&amp;D? If that's the case, then no matter what major you pick it's going to be an uphill battle. These jobs aren't as numerous as the ""support"" engineering jobs (the manufacturing, quality, validation, etc. engineers) so there's always going to be more competition. And these positions really hinge on you getting a great internship/co-op from a reputable company. It doesn't have to be a large, well-known company, but you will need to search out these companies. I can't stress how utterly important this internship is to get, and you WILL be competing against MEs, ChemEs, EEs for these positions. Are BMEs at a disadvantage compared to other majors? I don't necessarily think so in the grand scheme of things, but the way our curriculum was set (at least when I was still at Tech) we didn't get to the meat of our ""true engineering"" courses until later half of your 3rd year/4th year. If you're looking for an internship as a second year/early in your third year that you're gonna be at a disadvantage with ME/ChemE/EE majors who are into their engineering courses. Also note that the Atlanta area doesn't have a great market for Life Sciences companies, so you will need to look outside the metro area for a lot of jobs. Speaking as someone who's recruited at a few Biotech Career Fairs, the department is still doing a pretty shitty job at trying to connect to Life Sciences companies and building pipelines (especially for co-op/internship programs). 


Now if you just wanna work in say the medical device industry, that's a different story. There are plenty of manufacturing and quality/validation engineering positions out there, and there are tons of internships/co-ops that companies offer for these jobs. It doesn't have the same glamor as being an R&amp;D engineer but there are a lot more positions in manufacturing and quality/validation than there are in R&amp;D. They will also help get your foot in the door to GMP manufacturing, which employers DO value. So once you have some experience with GMP, you can work your way into a role you want by moving laterally towards what you want. I've seen a bunch of people come in as a validation engineer, then transition into a manufacturing engineer role, transition that into a system owner/plant engineer role, and then become a project engineer all within a handful of years. It requires work, effort, and planning, but you do have a pathway to get to what you want. 


Do note that a specific field/industry such as biomechanics is a very niche, small industry. There's only a handful of non-start up players, and within those players there's only a handful of design focused engineers. Casting your net wider, to say just medical devices in general, gets you to a ton of companies doing everything from implants and prosthetics all the way down to IV bags, needles, and sutures. By working at one of these companies you'll get familiar with how the FDA regulates medical devices, which will make you more attractive to other GMP employers. So even if you do switch to ME, it will still be hard to get into a dedicated role/position in biomechanics. You may need to layer on research and a masters if you want a stable position in the industry. Do you want to work in other fields besides biomechanics that are similar in work? Or would you rather work in the industry or similar industries doing something else besides design? That's what you have to decide on. 


Feel free to PM me if you have any additional questions. ",Neutral,"bme, jobs, industry, engineering, curriculum, internships, competition, me, cheme, ee, atlanta, life sciences, biotech, gmp, manufacturing, quality, validation, r&d, projects, biomechanics, medical devices,",5,2019-01-30
comment,"And as for BMED 2210 (at least when I took the class), it was a very polarizing subject. The class is essentially a take on CHBE-2100; it's a ChemE class through and through. BMED-3300 is essentially the v2.0 of 2210, and is an amalgamation of fluid, mass, and heat transfer. I believe that MEs still have to take heat transfer/fluid transfer? I'm a bit unclear, but that is something to take into consideration. Your other BMED classes are going to be some mechanics, some more ""problem solving,"" lab classes, and a few bio based classes. There is also BMED-3520 (or whatever it is nowadays) which was VERY professor specific, and was on the entire spectrum of EE-based, ME-based, ChemE-based. But most of these classes are much more structured with defined curriculum than the ""flipped classroom"" act of 2210. I'm not saying all of these other classes are structured fantastically, but it's much better than a lot of 2210 setups. 2210 is now especially the main weed-out for BME's.

comment,"&gt;I had a really great time. Campus was way quieter, Tech Rec wasn’t crowded, and I grew super close to my floor and most of my current friends are those I met over the summer. I also knocked out 7 credit hours. Definitely one of the best times I’ve had so far here (although I’m only in my second semester) and I have no regrets doing it. Sure, you give up your last “real” summer, but you have a lot of fun, you’re productive, and the gym isn’t crowded

For what it's worth I was a summer 2011 freshman, let me tell you - invaluable. Turned out to be the only B I got in my whole time at Tech. More importantly,  I learned in a matter of weeks how I needed to adjust my study skills vs. most people learning in months their fist semester. Also, it gets you slightly ahead of your peers in terms of hours which lets you take a lighter semester, which boosts you even more. I hated it at the time, but looking back, was probably among the most valuable experiences I had.",Positive,"college, summer, friends, productivity, gym, adjustment, study skills, advantages.",1,2019-01-31

comment,"&gt; What the FUCK are my bachelor’s and soon to have masters degree for then?

I would argue that the appropriate response should be ""why the FUCK is a book with such a limited domain more helpful to succeed a coding interview than a quality college education?"" and further, ""why the FUCK are coding interviews composed of problems I'll probably never encounter again?"". I understand (or hope) that the thought-process matters more than the rote domain knowledge, but I feel like there must be a better way to extract that process than quizzing people on particulars of heaps.

As someone who breezed through 1332, but just isn't that great in a great at technical interview (I'll get a job one of these days...), I've never once thought that a textbook understanding of datastructures and algorithms has made me *that* much better of a developer.

comment,"What you’re experiencing is a shift in the market. Demand for EE has been down for awhile now because software has lower capex cost than hardware. Even ME’s are being told to code for the same reason. While it sucks I know, the reality is the degree you spend 4 or more years obtaining is only good for getting you past an automated software filter that companies use on resumes. To actually get a job, it often requires things not taught in class from software, to leadership, charisma, etc. My recommendation would be to find whatever job you want, and focus on what qualifications they’re looking for. I spent my entire senior year only studying for jobs and largely ignoring academics because I realized school could no longer take me where I needed to go. Just know to not have so much faith in your degree alone, because most companies have zero faith in it. Once you start getting interviews with companies  that do multi round assessments you’ll see how the corporate world dictates what skills you actually need and often wonder if the degree is even worth the paper it was printed on.

comment,"I have seen other posts that quote admissions counselors as saying they prefer the standardized AP courses over DE. Of course, they like students who have proved themselves in GT’s Distance Math program. Regardless of intended major, take the most rigorous math program you can (e.g., AP Cal BC as a junior, distance math as a senior). 

GT students are involved in their communities. If you can make an impact as a full time dual enrolled student, that’d be impressive. And while they want students who love to learn, I think racking up non-transferable college credits is unnecessary. Unless your high school is academically very poor, or you are totally unable to interact socially, and GSU is convenient to attend, I’d recommend staying put and taking the most advanced courses your school offers.

comment,"I was in your exact position second semester of my freshman year. I switched from BME to ME and have absolutely no regrets about it. I still wanted to do something medical related but felt BME wouldn’t give me sufficient mechanical design knowledge to do what I want to do. The next year when I went to the biotech career fair, a lot of companies were more interested in me because I was ME. A couple companies (Eli Lily I think was one?) said they had only recently started accepting job apps from BMEs but were still very hesitant to hire BMEs. I ended up getting a really great co-op where I got a huge amount of design experience. It wasn’t a medical related job, but I learned a ton while there. I started working as an undergrad researcher in a really cool biomechanics lab this semester, and my co-op experience was a big reason I was hired. I would not be able to do the research I’m doing now had I not switched to ME and taken that co-op. All that said, I know plenty of BMEs that got internships and jobs, but a lot of those jobs also sound pretty uninteresting to me. Minoring in CS would be really beneficial whether you switch majors or not. As for BMED 2210, I could rant for hours about that stupid class. ","Positive

If I'm up to it, I may do a couple of things during downtime during the day, but that's about it. This strategy is ideal imo because it allows you to break down assignments and get ahead on things. Like I will read a couple of sections of the current chapter for psych, do a problem or two for math, a problem or two for algorithms, and crank out a couple of steps for my infosec project. At that rate I'm on my way to finishing things on time and not stressing about them. So yeah, those are my two cents.",Positive,"motivation, time management, productivity",2,2019-01-31
