comment,"If your concerns are as serious as you describe, then you should seek a mental health provider outside of the university. Be slightly forewarned, it's not that easy to get an appointment right away in most places. It does takes some back and forth. I would prioritize it and go make it happen as soon as you can. Working on yourself takes time and the quicker you can begin the quicker you are on the path. Even still, it's a process that could take awhile (and then a life long process after that to maintain), but it's worth it. The school is trying to provide a resource, but I'd say you need a more comprehensive solution and not just a resource.  Tech has started the CARE office renovation to do more and provide an easy first step for student drop in (not yet completed), but additionally, the state pay ranges for therapist roles are far below the market rate for those roles in the private sector.  This makes it hard to attract qualified people to the role when they are worth more outside of a state agency.

I would recommend you make an appointment outside of the university. You'll thank yourself for it later. It'll costs some money, but you can't afford not to (and writing from personal experience).

I guess it's easy to feel jaded about the admissions process when you, along with your friends, work so hard in highschool only to see that nothing you do is a guarantee for which colleges accept or reject you. But I think it's important to remember that the college itself is only about 50% (maybe less) of the experience while the other 50% comes from what you make of the four years.

Later in the meeting the body moved to appeal his decision twice: first to direct him to stop not yielding time to the Pres &amp; VP (this passed), second to readmit them to the meeting (Terry complied immediately so I withdrew the motion and then brought them back in).   


As for the voting records, I've been asking for them to be public since December. The bylaws stipulate they should be posted online weekly with the meeting minutes, but this hasn't been followed the past two years. Last year they were available upon request but this year they have not been available at all. I will be working w/ our tech team to make them consistently available going forward.

Second, you earn a 40% bonus for completing homework questions at least 48 hours before the due date. Assuming you earn the full 10 bucket points before that, that's an extra 2 points on your course grade.

Third, in cases of a particularly difficult final, they have curved just the final in the end. No guarantee, but they won't fuck you over on the final.

Here's the secret: Tech admissions are holistic, and they tend to like students who show a sense of direction. I think your stats look like they are on track, and you should be in good shape as long as you keep improving. If you want to be safe, you could try to push your ACT composite up 3-5 points.

What you should try to do now is write your story. Are you a band kid? STEM geek? Debate junkie? Something new and different? You should choose extracurricular activities that make you happy and do your very best at them. As for AP classes, pick those which run with your narrative. I, for example, was a SciOly nerd and filled my electives with STEM APs.

Anyway, I wouldn't drop it just because it looks like a B is likely. Yeah, it sucks if you've made As in prior classes, but it's not the end of the world and you can't possibly expect to go all the way through Tech with all As (it certainly happens, but going in with that expectation is foolish).

If it's any consolation, I know tons of people who were happy just to have passed 2211/2, let alone shoot for an A or even a B. I know, that may not make it sting less if you really expected an A, but sometimes it's healthy to take a step back for some additional perspective.","Neutral

1. has a zero element

2. adds together to get you another thing that exists in that same chunk of things

3. can be multiplied by a scalar and give you back something that's also in the chunk of things

you can call that a vector. in that sense, the space of functions (technically not *all* functions, but L^2 normalizable functions) is a vector space. f(x) = 0 is a function, f1(x) + f2(x) just gives me another function, and c\*f(x) gives me another function. 

so when we talk about fourier series, what we're really saying is that your input function‚Äîhere, sin^2 3x‚Äîis a ""vector"" in that sense. a fourier series is merely a change of basis; another way of writing the function. in the complex exponential case, you're just writing a function like this:

c1 e^ix + c2 e^2ix + c3 e^3ix + ...

this is just like writing the vector: 

&lt;a,b,c&gt; = a x-hat + b y-hat + c z-hat.

there, your basis is &lt;xhat,yhat,zhat&gt;, so any vector in R^3 can be written &lt;a,b,c&gt; with the understanding that those *coordinates* are just *coefficients* of the basis vectors.  

similarly, a discrete fourier transform using the complex exponential basis is just saying:

&lt;c1,c2,c3,...&gt; = c1 e^ix + c2 e^2ix + c3 e^3ix + ...

it's the same thing (except it's infinite-dimensional, but who cares?). (and i guess in this case they're summing from -infinity to infinity rather than 0 or 1 to infinity, that doesn't really matter either.)

so when the problem asks you to solve for ""g5"", what they're asking you to do is to find the coeffecients &lt;c_-5, c_-4,...,...c_4,c_5&gt;. adding those up and multiplying them by their corresponding basis vectors gives you an approximation of the input function, f.

this is just like a taylor series, in a way, which is another change of basis. when you add more terms, you get closer to the original function, like [here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/FourierSeriesExamples_1200.gif). 

of course, because functions are continuous, analytic things (at least the ones in L^2 typically are), unless you happen to be writing something already in the natural fourier basis (like sin, cos, or a complex exponential), it takes infinite coordinates to write them down exactly‚Äîjust like it does for a taylor series for everything but a polynomial.

comment,"no problem; sorry i can't be of more help. the last thing is that i *think* that this should only be non-zero for three terms: j = -6, 0, and 6. so i kind of expect your coefficient list to be {0,...,1/2,...,0} if you only take up to 5th order. Because if you go to sixth order, 

{-(1/4), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1/2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -(1/4)}

is what i get, and dotting that with the basis vectors to express it in functional form gives us 

-1/4 e^-6ix + 1/2 + -1/4 e^6ix

= 1/2 - 1/4 (e^-6ix +e^6ix)

= 1/2 - 1/4 (2 Cos 6x)

= 1/2 - 1/2 Cos 6x

= 1/2 (1 - Cos 6x)

But (1 - Cos a)/2 is Sin(a/2)^2 , by a half-angle formula, so:

(1 - Cos 6x)/2 = Sin(6x/2)^2 

= Sin(3x)^2 ,

If all application requirements (including final grades on transcript for all required courses) are met and received by May 1, then the student is likely to receive their decision on May 15. This will come with the caveat that admission can be rescinded at the discretion of admissions (usually only if you fail a bunch of courses your last semester).

If spring semester classes are part of your requirements, submit your transcript as soon as available. The working assumption is that not everyone will wait until June 1 to submit, because you're right, they'd only have 2 weeks to review before decisions are due...that being said, any part of your application that is submitted earlier will have already been reviewed, so it's only the transcript that would change.","Neutral

comment,"1. What you‚Äôre feeling is normal.

2. With the caveat that I finished undergrad eleven years ago (groan), I would say in general that it‚Äôs a good time to think about things outside of school that bring you fulfillment. You‚Äôll get the spark back for your major, etc. eventually. But take it from somebody who‚Äôs been in the grind for a while: you‚Äôll need things outside of school or work to get you through the tough times. If you think being down on your major is bad, just wait until you‚Äôre forced to work alongside someone you can‚Äôt stand. Your faith in your chosen career can evaporate *real* quick in that situation. What gets you through might look like a GT club, athletic activity, romance, religious affiliation, LARPing group...who knows. It could be literally anything.

comment,"I think you have two broad choices:

1. If you can decide your major will translate (even loosely) into a career path (e.g., an engineering background to go into sales if need be), then adjust your attitude about school; stop looking at it as being ""fun"" or ""rewarding"", view it as a task to be accomplished and push through it (like you are trying to finish a marathon). The co-oping might help, it may an opportunity to figure what kind of career path you want to take; but don't approach it trying to see what you'll get out of the job but instead figure out how much of yourself your can put into it, what you can learn to do the job better, etc. Even if you do end up hating that job you've learned something about future choices. FYI, co-oping really helped me in that it gave just enough vision of how the stuff I was learning could be used in the real world to be willing to push through classes without constantly thinking, ""why do I need to learn this?"" And it gave me breathing room in that I didn't have to take classes 2 semesters in a row.
2. If you decide your major is completely out of sync with the type of career you want, or you don't even know what you want to do, then maybe you need to quit school and get a job; that path will either help you figure out what career you want and/or motivate you to go back to school (Tech or elsewhere) when you realize your prospects without a degree are not as attractive (which may or may not be true). In this scenario be sure you understand the ramification of leaving school in terms of what is required to return should you want to do so. I was really fortunate in that I had my crisis of motivation prior to my sophomore year and spent the summer working for my dad (non-technical grunt work); he successfully motivated me (I never worked so hard, nor got worse tasks foisted on my in previous summers) to go back and earn that Tech diploma and get a ""real"" job. :-)

The bottom line is that you aren't going to get your motivation back absent some sort of vision or goal. And a Georgia Tech degree is more of a means to a goal rather than the goal itself (but it **is** an accomplishment!).

I obviously don't know you (or even your major) so this really can't be taken as valuable advice for **what to do** but maybe it's helpful on **how to frame the decision process**.",Neutral,"career, school, motivation, co-oping, degree, advice, decision, vision, goal, accomplishment, major, tech.",8,2019-03-04

It's silly that our culture pretends people should have their entire future figured out when they're barely an adult.

Assuming all of those 540 peds were killed by cyclists, that is a tiny, tiny percentage of people killed by cyclists. I've never seen the actual stats as to how many people or killed or injured by cyclists, but it's small. There have been two peds killed in the past 5-6 years in NYC to my knowledge.

All of this means that cyclists are NOT a real problem on our streets. The massive deadly bull in the china shop that is America is the motor vehicle. GTPD, you should be focusing on driver education and enforcement, not putting resources into blaming cyclists for crashes.

If your parents are well off, you got good financial aid, or have a good scholarship, I don't see the harm in it either.

If you're just trying to have a successful career, or go to a good graduate school, go elsewhere. That 100k-200k of debt is a legitimate shackle around your neck. I was in state and don't know a whole lot about the loan system, but using [this calculator](https://www.salliemae.com/college-planning/tools/student-loan-repayment-calculator/), 100k, 10 years and 5.05% from [this table](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/interest-rates) that 100k turns into $1,063/month.

The video ties the dangers of biking to not signaling. For starters, the biker (actor) in this video would have been hit if he signaled. The oncoming car obviously had the right of way, and signaling doesn't let you turn across someone else's lane.   


This is gtpd's response to the lack of safety for bikers (as well as feeling unsafe as a biker, which is also important). Instead of addressing issues as is their responsibility, they blame bikers. In my experience biking in and around the GT campus, most of the problems arise from cars entering or blocking the bike lane. Buses, too, swerve into and block the bike lane (not just at bus stops). Rubbish in the bike lanes. Lack of appropriate marking that the bike lane ends or is closed. No bike lane and being edged by passing cars toward the sidewalk/gutter. Cars turning right across the bike lane without looking. Cars running red lights and stop signs. Cars not yielding when it's not their turn. Scooters and pedestrians violating traffic laws.   


Due to the significant presence of GTPD on campus, they see these dangers all the time. They've seen me bail onto the sidewalk as a car swerves into the bike lane in tech square. They have seen cars turn left across my path (and narrowly miss me as I respond) as I climb the Ferst hill and pass Fowler and Techwood. They have never done anything. I've approached them to ask why. Nothing. I blame the vehicles that disregard my safety, and I blame GTPD for not acting to protect my safety.   


Do bikes sometimes fail to signal or roll a stop sign? Sure. I invite you to respond appropriately to those issues. This video was not made in good faith. ",Negative,"bike safety, gtpd, blaming, disregard for biker safety.",-3,2019-03-06

I was on our CORE unit for a while and we spent the majority of our day enforcing and educating cyclists and pedestrians.  We have a traffic enforcement team who make traffic stops and issue citations / warnings to vehicles in high accident areas.

comment,"There are straightforward solutions, they're not groundbreaking. Hire more therapists. There's an initial consultation before care begins, and it takes two weeks before you can be seen for one. After that, it's often another two weeks to begin therapy. That turnaround from coming in to try and talk to someone to actually receiving care shouldn't take ¬º of the semester. By then, it may be academically too late to start working with that student on short term strategies to manage mental health.

Alternately, mandate that departments develop manageable curriculum which doesn't require placing the class scores on a curve. It makes students anxious to spend all semester wondering if their grade is good. People have financial aid and future graduate education dependent on their grades.

comment,"Hey, I'm not really sure what to say, after all I'm just a fellow student like you. But I guess what I wanted to say is that I understand you, I see you, I know I've been here before. Heck I end up in this place alot, often when things aren't even going particularly badly. But hey, emotions aren't always so rational. But the thing is, knowing most everyone has dealt with this same kind of feeling at least a little, doesn't actually tend to make me feel much better in the moment. 

As a stranger I can't really look at your life and say ""here's the problem"", but I can say that when you hear  that it gets better that's so rarely true on its own. You actually have to do something to make it better. And maybe that means re-evaluating things. Maybe your taking too many classes. Maybe Tech actually just isn't the best place for you. And I know accepting something like that might seem like accepting failure, but it's so completely not. And maybe it's just what your studying in particular. Maybe your looking at a field of work that doesn't really bring you joy. Maybe try applying for internships outside of the field you would normally. As for making friends, truth is its really freaking easy and really freaking hard at the same time. As someone with pretty extreme social anxiety I know I am often petrified at the thought of going up to another person. Classes and clubs can often help with this, work as somewhat of an ice breaker. But honestly you kinda just have to suck it up and reach out. And remember that nobody else will ever think you're as awkward and weird as you think you are yourself. And hey, youre on Reddit. If your looking for people to see a movie with or grab dinner with, or play board games with, or even just study with, here's a great place to do that without having to approach it in person.

But above all else if you do actually recognize that you are depressed or suicidal and that you need help there is absolutely nothing wrong with reaching out. Nobody will think less of you for it. I know gt counseling gets a bad rap but they're a good starting point at least. And there are plenty of other mental health resources or even just regular students to reach out to.

And with that in mind if you ever need someone to just like rant at or talk to or whatever feel free to PM me, and I'm sure there are plenty of others on here who would say the same.

comment,"It's exactly what you make of it. No more, no less. The answer also depends on if you mean the party scene or the general social scene.

**Party Scene:** One of the most accurate statements I've heard is ""The keg won't just fall into your lap"". At lots of large universities its almost difficult not to get into the party scene, it's just what everyone does on the weekend. It IS the culture so you do it too. That's not so at GT. If you want to, you can absolutely find people to go out with; and If you don't want to, well, there's plenty who will be staying in because they gotta finish that CS1371 HW by midnight. and to be completely frank, a lot of us would rather spend the night screwing around with microcontrollers or 3D printing things than at a bar. On one hand, that sounds lame. On the other, it's awesome that you can be programming ardiunos on a Friday night or go on 6-hr bar hop and they're both equally valid answers to people here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Social Scene:** This one really is up to you. Its college, go explore. GT has an incredible selection of clubs, many of which are very very well run and quite large/ successful. I'd strongly encourage everyone to go check out a couple. There is a club or group for nearly anything you can imagine; It's a great way to informally meet people who you share an interest with.

I have been through a lot of situations where a lot of friction is added to the learning process for no good reason. I have encountered directions for assignments that  are sloppy written or made from old assignments where parts are removed or replaced and reading the assignment doesn‚Äôt always make sense; you need to go back and forth with your prof TA ask for clarification because how poor the documentation is. Some classes don‚Äôt use a textbook and all the information comes from what your prof is able to teach in 50 minutes imagine the errors or his turn of phrase when he said one thing but meant something else. I can give a bunch of examples and every semester I have an example like this. I don‚Äôt think this is how learning works; It just adds unnecessary pain to the process. Sometimes I go to MIT Courseware to look up a concept because they have materials from multiple classes with notes lecture slides videos from different  profs if I don‚Äôt understand one I‚Äôll go look up lectures from another. What do we have? to resume the idea,  at times we/I sacrifice understanding of the material just to finish an assignment submit as get the grade with no lesson learned at the end of it...it‚Äôs like you‚Äôve  been pushed into a lake and somehow you‚Äôve managed to make it to the shore  yet you haven‚Äôt really learned to swim ",Negative,"learning, friction, documentation, errors, understanding, assignments, teaching, examples, mit courseware, sacrifice.",2,2019-03-06

ML is more about the algorithms (supervised learning, unsupervised, randomized optimization, and reinforcement learning) where you learn more about why and how they work.

ML4T is like 8ish homework‚Äôs that are not too difficult and are relatively short, 2 exams that were like 30 multiple choice questions and piazza participation.

ML is 4 assignments in which you take datasets and apply the algorithms to them and then analyze results. 2 exams as well I think.

Overall, ML4T is probably less work but more often whereas ML is more work at one time but less often. In terms of grading ML4T is fairly straightforward and relatively simple (autograders for homework that are pretty representative of your grade) whereas in ML you could be failing all the way through but the curve brings you to a B or A.

I disagree with the ‚Äúgun violence‚Äù statistics because it includes suicides and accidents. There are approximately 30k gun deaths per year, roughly 1/3rd are suicides 1k is accidental. A large portion of gun deaths are related to gangs and drugs. To put that into perspective 33k people die in car accidents each year, 112k-365k die from obesity related health issues and 250k-440k people die from medical errors in hospital. Deaths from guns is an important issue, no one would disagree with that.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, great job to APD and GTPD for their work on this.  Especially GTPD, because GTPD is chill.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me just drop some of the smug statements from a few posters in here (wink wink they're the posts with all the downvotes who probably won't read this anyway, because they are too busy mashing their fingers in their ears and closing their eyes in pursuit of their safe spaces).  Meming is fun, but it does seem as though some people actually believe anti-gun scare tactics for some reason.  If you want to have a debate, fine, but judging by the ad hominems and lack of any critical thought exhibited by some of these posts (hope you're not engineering majors), it pains me to think that some of you actually believe the diarrhea that spews forth from your fingertips.

&amp;#x200B;

As one user suggested:  &gt;Try to learn the facts before spewing bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure!  Let's take a look.  Per the article:  ""Police say Davis has a number of prior convictions including armed robbery, burglary, and auto thefts.""  This means he's a felon, and, unless he had his rights restored/was re-enfranchised (doubtful), in the state of Georgia he generally would be not legally allowed to possess firearms.  Which brings us to the next point:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;straw purchases

&amp;#x200B;

Straw purchases outside of gifts, let alone straw purchases aimed at skirting firearm control legislation, are federally illegal when purchasing from FFLs.  Georgia has its own regulations on top of these, including for private sales.  cf. O.C.G.A. ¬ß 16-11-113 (you can look up the section on LexisNexis)

&amp;#x200B;

Some more links:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Most of the guns criminals have were purchased legally at stores

&amp;#x200B;

Depending on the source (FBI statistics, city-specific crime statistics), anywhere from approximately 40-85% of guns used in crimes in the USA are obtained illegally.  This hardly qualifies as ""most,"" except for a slim majority in the most conservative estimates.

&amp;#x200B;

Some citations:  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/27/new-evidence-confirms-what-gun-rights-advocates-have-been-saying-for-a-long-time-about-crime](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/27/new-evidence-confirms-what-gun-rights-advocates-have-been-saying-for-a-long-time-about-crime) , [https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

What \*is\* a statistic is that owners of concealed carry permits comprise the most law-abiding demographic in the USA, committing even less crimes than uniformed police officers.  [https://www.dailywire.com/news/8255/report-concealed-carry-permit-holders-are-most-law-aaron-bandler](https://www.dailywire.com/news/8255/report-concealed-carry-permit-holders-are-most-law-aaron-bandler)  Now, whether or not gun owners should all be subject to some sort of credentialing, is a separate topic of discussion.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;It‚Äôs the 21st century and gun crime is still a thing in America? Smh

\&gt;\[the USA is\] the only country where this is a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Sort by homicide:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_firearm-related\_death\_rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate)  NB:  This does not even take into account overall homicide rates or availability of firearms, which would weaken your point even further.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone alluded to earlier, we should just make armed robbery, kidnapping, brandishing, murder, etc. all illegal and then it will cease to exist.  hmm...

&amp;#x200B;

There are more than enough gun control laws already in place.  Furthermore, it is clear that this case was not some momentary lapse of judgement or crime of passion.  Davis has a long rap sheet for violent crimes against innocent citizens, and, if I may personally interject, is incapable of reform.  People like this will continue to violate laws, whether they are in place or not.  Adding more regulations to further limit the self-defense capabilities of upstanding citizens is an exercise in ludicrous folly.  Well, our taxes will now be paying for his free room and board for quite a long time, through no fault of our own... the burden placed by individuals such as this forever mark society until their death.",Negative,"gun control, gun violence, law enforcement, crime statistics, felonies.",5,2019-03-08

It's not that I did so bad in the ECE classes. It's the ECE Department and the curriculum that made me switch to CS. I was considering CompE as well because I didn't want to lose all ECE course credits. But I decided to give it up.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of the ECE classes are poorly taught, in my opinion. I took ECE2036 (Engineering Software Design) and was really disappointed. All I learnt from that class was C++ syntax and easy programming projects (on a microcontroller). ""Engineering Software Design"", really? This is nothing compared to CS1331 or even CS1301.

&amp;#x200B;

The lectures were boring. Every time I asked questions, he struggled to answer any of the questions. Respectfully, I think the professor didn't know much about programming.  I expected to learn a good amount of programing in the class but then came out of the class with an A and learnt **nothing**.

&amp;#x200B;

CS classes are a lot better than ECE classes. CoC career services are better than ECE's as well. I might be biased, but I don't think I'm heavily biased at all.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're interested in computer architecture, CS has a thread for that. System Arch is what you're looking for. Also look into Device thread. ECE classes is just too much theory-based and don't embed a lot of programming elements at all - or at least at the level I expected.

My advice, and my future plan? Don't EVER take your hands/eyes off your phone/wallet/purse/whatever valuables you might have with you in Atlanta.

comment,"There is a whole black market of guns currently. But this doesn‚Äôt answer my question. So if guns are made illegal and there isn‚Äôt a second civil war, what does that accomplish? Less gun crime doesn‚Äôt mean less crime. Criminals would just find something else to use. For example, if criminals start using knives to commit crimes like they are in the UK do we then fight for knife control? If someone doesn‚Äôt have access to guns will they no longer want to be a criminal? I think we can look at the UK again for the answer. Islamic terrorists in the UK don‚Äôt have access to guns so do you know what they do? The get vans and run people over.

I think we can both agree we want less crime, and we should focus on ways to reduce crime. I disagree that gun control is a good method to prevent crime and that‚Äôs alright we disagree on that issue.

I was able to get into classes that would've otherwise been more difficult to get in during the fall. Plus, once fall semester rolls around, you'll have priority above all of the incoming freshman when it comes to registration time tickets. So, for classes that normally fill up with freshman very quickly, you're more likely to get them.",Positive,"college/university.

comment,"For those who were REJECTED - ME TOO back when I applied as a freshman in 2010, but I went to an easier school, had a great first few years, and did all my core classes / math.  I applied and was rejected for transfer to GT two more times and the third consecutive semester I applied, I finally got in.  Got my undergrad degree here with Highest Honors and now I'm back here finishing up my PhD.

Don't be discouraged if you got rejected!  it is probably in your best interest anyway to choose a university where you're confident you'll be able to maintain a GPA &gt; 3.5, (if you're not ready for it, the first few years at GT can wreck your GPA in ways you don't even know) then transfer to GT or another choice school when the time is right :)  Ultimately future employers only really care about the university that grants your degree, and I would guess you'll have more fun in your first couple of years if you don't have to go through the famously difficult GT engineering math track. 

PRO TIP:  Make sure to try to only take classes that will transfer 100% credit to GT, that way you avoid wasting time and ensure you'll graduate faster than I did.

TLDR: If you got rejected just do your first couple of years in demo mode at some chump school, then start with a clean slate GPA after you transfer to GT and just don't fuck up your last couple of of undergrad. ",Neutral,"college, rejection, transfer, academics, advice",30,2019-03-09

I can speak from experience when I attended a primarily black institution (63% black but not HBCU). Having diversity is better.

I agree with the others that the MSE courses are not terribly math-intensive, with notable exceptions being thermodynamics, statics (basically structural mechanics), and deformable bodies (basically structural mechanics that's more complicated). Intro to circuits has some math, but it's not central to the grade. If you can take some time this year and this summer to brush up on your algebra and trigonometry chops, you should be good to go. I didn't take the Tech Calculus or physics courses (transfer student), but for college level math courses you definitely need to be sharp on your algebra and trig.

I'm glad you're interested in research! Dr. Losego is an excellent professor and mentor, see if you can get in with him if you're interested in his work (atomic layer deposition and thermal materials, mostly). There are tons of research opportunities with other professors, though, and it's even ok to work with professors outside of MSE if you want some broader experience. Your first summer after freshman year is a great time to get started with research (the first year is going to be crazy with classwork anyway, you should focus on that). I'd council to not take more than 15 hours in any given semester; it's better to have a happy life than to cross some arbitrary finish line in the designated 4 years. Then again, talk with your advisors and make sure you aren't missing certain key classes- a lot of major-specific classes (i.e., MSE courses) are only offered once a year, either in the Fall or the Spring, so you want to plan ahead to get those scheduled at the right time.",Positive,"graduation, program, courses, math, research, professor, mentor, summer, freshman year, classwork, advisors, key classes.",3,2019-03-10

comment,"I would advise to wait on taking CS 1301 until fall/spring semester and try to get into the online section (which is extremely easier than the in-class one). Also, if you don't manage to get into the online one and want to move on soon to CS 2316, I recommend taking the in-class one in the spring, as I heard fall 1301 is harder in the fall, as it's geared more towards CS majors (not sure if this is actually true). I'm also a first-year IE who took 1301 last fall with McDaniel and although it wasn't overly difficult, I definitely had to work a lot (ended up with a high B, as paper exams for coding are hell for me but managed to pull a 104 for my homework grade). The class seemed high paced but it was probably due to it being my first time coding, but when talking to my other IE friends who took the online CS I realized I had a way better understanding of coding than they did, so that's something I would keep in mind. 

I am planning on taking physics over summer as well, but not at Tech. My opinion is to take physics later at a community college if you can and focus on getting your major class knocked out (ISYE 2027). I haven't taken discrete yet so I'm not sure if that's viable alongside 2027 during the summer, but I'm sure other people in this subreddit could help you out. Good luck!

(Keep in mind that I'm just a first year, so I may not have enough knowledge as everyone else, but these are what I experienced) ",Neutral,"course scheduling, class difficulty, coding, physics, community college, major classes, discrete mathematics, summer courses, first-hand experience",3,2019-03-10

comment,"Which program?  Focus of questions might vary slightly for full time/evening/executive but are generally similar.

They're basically not going to throw curveballs unless you bring up something weird.  It's a structured interview (and usually only a single interview) meant to sort candidates, so throwing strange curveball questions only kinda skews things.  It's less like a job interview where they might throw something to see how you react.  Most of the variance in questions just comes up if they see something in your background/resume that needs explanation.

I don't remember too many specifics which is just as well since if I did it would probably be improper to reveal them.  But you can pretty much count on in any MBA interview anywhere: 

1. Tell me/us about yourself (i.e., throw your 30-sec elevator pitch -- have this thought out and rehearsed)
2. Walk me/us through your resume (work history)
3. So why do you want an MBA? (Basically only two right answers here: 1) to accelerate advancement at my current company/industry, or 2) to give framework of skills to help pivot from another field/role/industry.  Think really hard before saying something else and don't say because you want more money, hate your job, got fired, just seems like a thing to do etc.)
4. So why Scheller/Ga Tech? (say almost anything but rankings; challenges of a rigorous curriculum, talented faculty, center of ATL industry etc., analytical emphasis, intersection of technology and business etc.  Goal here is to show you've done your research and actually want to go there for specific and concrete reasons and aren't just applying for the hell of it and you really want Emory)
5.  Do you have any questions about our program/curriculum?  (More of the same -- show you've been thinking seriously about this.  Be prepared with at least one or two solid questions)

Wearing a suit or equivalent professional attire should be a no-brainer too, and for the love of George P. Burdell **BE ON TIME**.  In general they're trying to assess how serious you are about this, how well you'll do with teammates and how well you'll do in interviews on graduation so you don't pull down their numbers.

This was mentioned in a podcast I listened to -- Savvy Psychologist I think.  Repetition builds strong friendships more than anything, but a shared hobby is good too. Sometimes it also just takes being the one to invite people out to do stuff. While printing out flyers for friends and posting nearby seems strange (even though it's not all that different from this), it may work out well. Bonus if you find someone in your major too. Whatever organization your major has can be a good start too.

comment,"I know this is exactly what you're looking for but I figured I would comment since you haven't gotten anything else yet. 

I live in the echo alternate plan, but I toured the 2 bedroom version of the Pelham (called the Turner Alternate) when I was looking for a place. They're obviously not identical, but the shape and layout of the unit is similar minus the extra bedroom. 

The layout of the renderings on their site are pretty accurate to the actual units. The entryway is a short hallway with a utility area and laundry closet on the side, which opens up to a joined living room kitchen area that has floor to ceiling glass windows on the back wall.
Bedroom is pretty standard and the closet is massive compared to a normal dorm closet. All the floors and ceilings are concrete and the walls are painted white or an off-white color. Countertops are granite and the bathroom is tiled floor. 

One thing to note that isn't obvious from the renderings online is that, unless the bedroom has a door (which the Pelham doesn't) the wall that separates the bedroom and the living room only goes about 3/4 of the way up to the ceiling. Usually a non-issue if you live alone, but it does let light get into the bedroom easily from the massive windows. I ended up taking down the blinds that they have installed and putting curtains up, but there are other, probably simpler things you could do to solve that problem. 

I tried to find some pictures that I took when touring but I think I deleted them :( If you have any other questions about that room I'm happy to try and remember it as best I can.

comment,"Insourcing dining - Sodexo and Aramark are business models by design. Many peer institutions run their own dining. We already have the money, we're just giving it to Sodexo to run the dining halls rather than using it ourselves (it's a $24.5 million contract). There may be larger capital expenses to build the infrastructure necessary (hiring new managerial staff, building food supply networks) so the transition may be costly, but Sodexo and Aramark would also run at a loss at the beginning of a contract and make up the money later.

The first step is making a joint committee with Campus Services and bring in some experts form other campuses‚Äô dining services to investigate a pubic dining option and figure out the exact cost at Georgia Tech. That‚Äôs exactly what the recently passed dining resolution was passed to do, but so far Campus Services has been very reluctant to allow students into the process and are instead deferring to Sodexo and Aramark, in our opinion out of path dependency.

If SGA‚Äôs executive cabinet prioritizes this issue for campus services and work with President Peterson‚Äôs successor and their admin, I believe this is a very real and implementable solution to a widespread issue on campus. We are already interviewing for the new AVP of Campus Services (after the last guy left from the ethics scandal) and potential candidates we‚Äôre looking at are from schools with public dining. We plan to appoint a VP of Campus Services who will prioritize this as their #1 issue and we will ensure students are involved in this process so that we can actually see the full cost-estimate of insourced dining and have students decide, rather than let this die in committee.

Right now, GT's freshman meal plan is the most expensive of any public university in Georgia. [https://www.usg.edu/assets/fiscal\_affairs/documents/tuition\_and\_fees/FY2019\_Food\_Services.pdf](https://www.usg.edu/assets/fiscal_affairs/documents/tuition_and_fees/FY2019_Food_Services.pdf) We're paying more than any other USG school but are getting very poor service. We believe we can get better quality food for a lower price by insourcing our operations.

Counseling - Through conversations with Dean Stein (Dean of Student, VP of Student Life) we have found that they have the money to spend, but it's just a matter of putting at the top of our priority list. They just don't do enough to keep salaries competitive  (our Psychiatrists get paid $160k compared to the market rate in ATL at $220k). SGA's legislature creates petitions and gets thousands of signatures in support of saving Under The Couch and exploring a public dining option, yet it really falls to the SGA Executive cabinet (cabinet members are paid, representatives aren't) after that to really push for these changes and work with the administration. If elected, John and I, along with our cabinet, will make it at the top of SGA's priorities to make this happen and will demand it from the President Peterson's successor. -V",Neutral,"business models, campus services, dining, cost, administration, priority, salaries, sga.",13,2019-03-11

comment,"Over the past year, there's been multiple attempts coming from the legislature (UHR) to make these changes on campus regarding Under The Couch and Public Dining. They've gotten overwhelming support and passed the resolutions easily, but when it comes to actually advocating for these issues and working with the administration, the current SGA exec has been very resistant to advocate for students, instead yielding to administrators whenever they indicate something would be an inconvenience.

For example, when UHR passed a resolution supporting Under The Couch, we were told by the Student Center that they'd already decided on square footage per organization a week prior and that it was ""impossible"" to give UTC space. That's simply not true: construction was still a year away at the point and the plans could have been changed if there was the will to do it. Additionally, the only student involvement in the plan was headed by the SCEC, an unelected student committee appointed by administrators without SGA members on it (it took a **lot** of effort for UHR members to even see the student center plans). The correct move would have been to challenge the validity of that committee and push for SGA oversight over the plans, instead the SGA exec backed down and even threatened to UHR to veto the UTC resolution.

The fact is, SGA exec's job is to directly interface with administrators. Cabinet members are paid to do this job, while representatives are just volunteers. We're running our campaign, and the UHR members who motivated the UTC and Dining resolutions have joined our campaign, precisely because we think it's critical that we have a SGA exec that's willing to stand up for students and advocate for these changes rather than apologize for administrators' mistakes.",Negative,"sga, campus changes, student advocacy, student involvement, student center plans, utc, public dining, administration.",16,2019-03-11

I felt that you haven't talked about specific steps in your marketing and addressed feasibility, but answering questions here really helps!

I have two questions.
1) One of the key points to your campaign is in-sourcing our dining halls which you argue benefits the student population, but is that really the optimal solution? Like sure we hear rumors that in-sourced dining halls are better, but is there empirical evidence and qualitative data telling us that they are? Or are we tunneling visioning on ""getting rid of Sodexo"" as the only solution? Would not renegotiating the contract to give more protections to customers (students) be a better and more feasible solution?

2) I'm actually on the other end of the Under the Couch debate, I don't really see the necessity of the space. From my view (I've worked with student center heavily in programming), The only group really using Under the Couch is the Musician's Network and no one else (like majority of usage not all). So why should we invest into a space that's really only utilized by one student organization rather than investing in another ballroom or more study space for students that would be more widely used?","Positive

comment,"Great Question! SGA is entrusted with allocating the Mandatory Student Activity Fee of $80/year that you and our fellow students pay. You can receive funding in two ways, budgets and bills. I think what you are referring to is a budget. Budgets are for annual recurring expenses that a student organization can foresee the need for a year out. The Undergraduate House and Graduate Senate vote to approve budgets at the end of the spring semester for the following fiscal year which is from July 1st to June 31st of the following year. Bills are more of a call to action, with a much shorter turnaround. Student organizations can submit bills even today to receive funding just 2 weeks later. As Vice-President of Finance, I whipped voted in the House and Senate to get a resolution passed to reduce the dues requirement to be eligible to receive a budget from $20/semester to $10/semester, which led to many student orgs, especially the cultural organizations which charge less in dues but have hundreds of members, to receive a budget for the first time. I personally view it as one of my greatest accomplishments in SGA and I was so happy to hear from the treasurer of Pride Alliance, that they had lowered their dues to $10/semester just because of this, and had a hike in their membership as a result. -V",Positive,"student government, student activity fees, budgets, bills, accomplishments, cultural organizations.",5,2019-03-11

comment,"Thanks for your questions! To answer them:

1. Both mental health and dining have been at the forefront for some time now. Though we have had some advances in terms of mental health resources (Counseling Center is putting out job offers for more counsellors and Psychiatry is expanding free sessions from 2 to 6), there‚Äôs still a lot more that can be done. We think it's clear the administration has been for the most part reactive, only responding to bad PR and media coverage of various scandals, rather than proactively addressing these issues.  And unfortunately, much of the advocacy around these issues has originated from outside SGA's exec, and SGA exec has been in a similar spot of reacting to and resisting student outrage &amp; discontent. SGA is definitely disconnected from the student body and very conflict averse, and because of this SGA members have felt at times like they have ownership over the administration's decisions and need to apologize or excuse them rather than challenge them.  

SGA needs to stop being reactive and instead embrace the student body. SGA should channel student concerns and discontent into an organized political vision. SGA has a lot of power on campus that is really underutilized at the moment. Through this campaign, we hope to raise students' political consciousness and derive a truly democratic mandate from the students to carry out these changes and reforms. Furthermore, while in office we hope to have an SGA that is truly participatory and inclusive of the student body so that when we hit roadblocks, we can solicit more support and assistance from the greater student body through student referenda and the bully pulpit, rather than giving up.

2. Many platforms in the past have been incomplete because candidates lose interest in actually enacting them once they win. We are very invested in actually carrying out our platform and we see this election as a means to carry out these reforms, not the other way around. Our top priority would be committing GT to insourcing our dining halls.   

We can immediately set up a committee with Campus Services to flesh out the full cost-estimate and timeline. We're pretty confident that once the cost-estimate comes back, it will indeed be the best option. Worst case scenario we have an uncomfortably long transition period of multiple years to get off Sodexo.",Neutral,"mental health, dining, administration, student government association, student body, political vision, reforms, student referenda, election, dining halls, insourcing, cost-estimate, timeline, campus services, sodexo.",6,2019-03-11

comment,"Thanks for your support! We would love to dive into your questions:  

1. UGA is ranked No. 10 in the country for dining, and it's cheaper. They have in-sourced dining. It's normal at peer institutions. The common argument for privatization is that a private company can give better service at a lower cost, but we're clearly exceptionally bad and very expensive. We should revert to the default of insourced dining. The Campus Services committee in SGA recently visited GSU which has insourced dining and they thought it was very impressive. Part of the process of creating a committee to investigate this (which is what the dining resolution [19J249](http://jacketpages.gatech.edu/bills/view/3184) called for) will be thoroughly collecting any relevant data and statistics before making the decision.


2. Under the Couch is an important asset to campus for a number of reasons. Like the Invention Studio or any of the other maker spaces around campus, it acts as a utility. At Under the Couch there are all of the tools necessary to create a band, hone your music, record it, create merchandise, find connections, take free lessons, etc. Additionally, it has all of the resources necessary to put on a variety of shows, and many different organizations use this function‚Äîwhether renting out supplies or hosting events in the space itself. As for those events in Under the Couch, it is actually a minority that are created by Musician's Network. Most of the events there are held by other student organizations (particularly cultural orgs) with assistance from Musician's Network members.  Now as for the Musician's Network programming, it acts as a public service similar to Dramatech... except it's completely free. All of MN's shows, weekly open mics, showcases, and other activities are entirely open to all students to participate in with no charge.  Also, a **lot** of people just enjoy hanging out there during the lounge hours in the day.

Depression *can* count as a disability under ADA, but like any other condition it must somehow impair ""major life activities"" to count; if you situation is as debilitating as you say, it should qualify. An ADHD diagnosis could also potentially help you get extra time on tests and such if that's an issue you've been having. The letter you get should ideally also give recommendations from your doctor as to what kind of accommodations would help you.

You then have an intake appointment where you discuss with an ODS staff member how best to implement accommodations to help you.

The fact that you are registered with ODS and any information you give them is confidential and will never be disclosed to potential employers.

I will say that Atlanta Metro thought me how to study. Instead of trying to study longer I took it upon myself to search for the best ways to study based on research. It in turn helped understand things that seemed too much for my comprehension.  

&amp;#x200B;

However, it took about a year and a half for my professor to say that if you knew the information that you should be able to explain it off head. I thought that since I got that ""A"" it meant that I knew what the hell I was doing.

&amp;#x200B;

With the Smaller class at Atlanta Metro professors had the time to give us advice on how to study and which way worked best depending on the subject.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I had to learn to use blank pieces of paper to write down pathways and see that everything made sense. I did this like 3-4 times until I had it down packed. Also, I had to write my own lectures that were about 80-150 slides in broad terms. This was so that I could try to record my self going through chapters whilst exploring the reasons and mechanisms behind the things I was seeing. Lastly, knowing the etymology of the words helped me realize that the words I looked at when I was 16, was not random, confusing, and sophisticated as I thought.

In response to the feasibility of Freshman Forgiveness:

&amp;#x200B;

This initiative is extremely feasible! As SGA's VP of Academic Affairs, I've had a pretty unique opportunity to sit on different faculty exec committees including the Student Regulation Committee‚Äî this committee creates and amends Institute policies pertaining to the undergraduate and graduate student body. Last Friday we met and actually spent 70% of our meeting discussing the extension of FF. Overall there was a neutral to positive view on FF, however, the committee members wanted more research and data (they love factual information) to make sure that if this policy was implemented it would actually be a net benefit for students. There has been no reports as of yet (coming soon) supporting FF. We'll be circling back around to this topic in April once Institute Research &amp; Planning gets back to us. Would love to hear any input/anecdotes you may have on FF and how it (if you've used it before) has helped you! -Haigh

1. As current SGA exec, I'm sure you guys know how important having a good cabinet is. How would you guys go about selecting cabinet members? There's a long history of nepotism blocking the way of good appointments. How can we be confident you won't do that?

2. Can you give concrete examples of things you two have accomplished as VP of IA and VP of Academic Affairs? 

3. To be honest, I've felt that SGA exec has done a poor job advocating for students this past year, an opinion echoed by many of my friends. SGA exists to advocate for students, not just play nicely with the administration. It seems like SGA exec this year has done a poor job of translating student opinion into actual action, a position shared by one of your fellow campaigns. What will you guys do differently next year to actually advocate for students?

4. For a more platform oriented question - you plan to ""Work to foster a safe and healthy Greek community by supporting robust and frequent communication between SGA leadership and Greek students"".

comment,"That's a great question!

 I think the biggest aspect of our platform is that we wanted to ideate diverse student experiences into creating promises that we can keep. Each idea on our platform is tangible and has been vetted to ensure that it is something that we can see results in a one year time. We believe that what really sets our platform apart from others is that the things we're proposing are new ideas but also ones that we are confident in our ability to make happen. We considered including some things such as switching to self-operated dining services on our platform, but after speaking to the person on our campaign who's been working closely with administrators on that, we also realize that there is a very real chance that we simply cannot do that because of laws dictating when contracts must be signed. We're happy to go into more detail on that if you'd like! The ability to actually implement our ideas was something we wanted to make sure was apparent in our campaign, as we don't want to be making empty promises. In recognizing that public dining halls are favored by many students, we will be diligent in advocating that our dining provider truly provide for all students regardless of dietary restrictions. This approach is intentional, and realistically will allow for us to collaborate with Campus Services and the dining provider on adapting the needs on campus. 

On the other hand, we also believe our platform draws strength from the fact that it introduces fresh ideas. As VP of Academic Affairs, mini-mesters are something Haigh has been working extremely closely on for the past year and they are at the point now where they've actually already come up with some mini-mester classes to offer fall semester. Reusable boxes in the dining halls are another example of something that's already been approved but hasn't been implemented yet. We recognized that we had the opportunity to put these things on our platform, but didn't want to in order to avoid confusion or misguiding people with regard to what SGA has already done this year. Instead of citing things that our current cabinet members, committee chairs, and President/VP team have been working on this year, we decided it would be in students' best interests for us to find out what we *haven't* been doing that students wanted. 

The group that gets elected is able to have a pretty large impact as long as they have the drive to push for it. The impact the elected leaders make has the ability to have a large impact if they remain committed and surround themselves with an uplifiting attitude.

For assignments, I acknowledge that I have a ton to do and then I just choose something and start. Even if it's the smallest, easiest assignment, once I finish one thing I can get some momentum going. Choose something, if you have it, that won't be discouraging to work on (i.e not in your worst class/something you can do relatively quickly) and do it to completion. Once you've done that, have a snack, go to the bathroom, and start on the next thing, building momentum by finishing things.

We spoke with her and she was very clear in that *if*  that's something we'll be able to do, it's going to be something that's decided in the next few weeks. The big issue on that front is that the contracting process has already begun and can't just be stopped in order to explore going self-op. Additionally, the lawsuit from Sodexo causes major complications and has led to administrators not being able to speak freely with students due to NDAs associated with the RFP process. While we do support the initiative and will do anything possible to bring it to fruition, we also recognized that it was unfair to promise that 1. this was something within SGA's power that we felt confident in our ability to get done and 2. that if this were to happen that it would something that wouldn't be decided in the next couple of weeks. There is actually a meeting happening this Thursday during which we expect to get more information on that front.

comment,"Thanks for the question! We're working on answering your other one right now as well, so bear with us. 

We‚Äôre certainly very enthusiastic about all of the points on our platform, and we‚Äôre confident we can achieve many, if not all, of them. To answer your question though:

**Open SGA‚Äôs Lines of Communication:**

We believe in the efficacy and ability of student leaders on campus to create inclusive and enriching communities, and want to empower everyone on campus to do what they love. If we had to eliminate all but a couple of our platform points, we believe that our goal of ensuring that SGA creates tangible communication structures and supports collaboration supports students most directly. We plan on making SGA‚Äôs resources easily accessible and useful while also incorporating robust feedback mechanisms to respond to the specific needs of the student body as we hear them. We want *all* students‚Äô voices to be heard so that we can serve the student body to the best of our abilities.

**Engaging the New President:** 

As we have learned in the past few months, GT‚Äôs leadership has a profound impact on students lives, both professionally and personally. As the new Presidential administrative team transitions onto campus, we believe it imperative that we engage them right from the early stages of their term on campus. We want to make sure that SGA is set up for relationships with the new administration, not only for this coming year but for many years to come. We want to hold the new President to a high standard of accessibility, relatability, and a true understanding of our student experience in the hopes that they will, in turn, expect their leadership teams to prioritize students.

It makes sense, seeing as LAPACK is one of the most efficient linear algebra libraries ever produced, and is where Matlab gets its atypical (for computer languages) 1-indexing on arrays, as Fortran also uses 1-indexed arrays.

It didn't start using LAPACK [until 2000](https://www.mathworks.com/company/newsletters/articles/matlab-incorporates-lapack.html), but even before that was built on top of other Fortran modules.  In fact, it was originally designed by UNM professor Cleve Moler:

comment,"Thanks for the response. I especially liked your bit about ensuring our new President is accessible from day 1. 

That said, not gonna lie, this response worries me some though for a couple reasons:

1) Prioritizing ""listening"" and ""establishing relationships with administration"" doesn't sound too different from current SGA, and current SGA has utterly failed at translating these things they listen about to actual results. Obviously those two priorities are both crucial components of getting things done, but they seem like the parts SGA is already competent at. Listening and building relationships doesn't do anything unless you actually capitalize on those relationships forcefully, and this response makes me worry that making friends with the new administration will be important than actually fighting for students. 

2) It doesn't have any concrete benefits to students immediately - its vague, and doesn't have specific action items. I agree that creating better channels with students and the administration will result in long-term benefits, but it seems like this is too vague in the short term to result in benefits I'll see before I graduate, which is somewhat counter to the supposed philosophy of your campaign's priority on short-term actions.",Negative,"sga, student government association, president, administration, relationships, results, students, benefits, campaign.",6,2019-03-12

comment,"That's a fair view, and we'd like to think that as well. At the same time, however, we don't think it's fair to make those promises when we can't say that for a fact and that will be decided long before the end of the year. 

The problem we're running into right now is that despite only a Notice of Intent to Award being sent out, we have no clue what the timeline is on the actual signing of the contract. Under Georgia State Procurement Law, any protests or lawsuits related to RFPs must be resolved ""as quickly as possible."" This means that a contract could be signed in 2 hours or in 2 months. Either way, a contract *will* be signed prior to July 1 of this year, as that's when the current contract expires. We've spoken to administrators at GSU, as they switched from contracting their retail out through Sodexo to self-op and will be speaking with UC Davis on Thursday (they did the same, but with all of their dining halls and retail). No matter what happens, we will need a buffer of approximately 1 year in order to hire labor, change the branding of Sodexo-owned locations, and get everything in place to switch to self-operated dining halls. This has been consistent at every school we've found that has switched from contracting out dining to going self-op. 

We know that's not going to gain us popularity points, but we also stand by our belief that SGA needs to continue being transparent and we believe making promises on things that will be out of our control goes directly against that. If you have any particular questions that you would like to be asked in the meeting with administrators on Thursday, we can let you know what they say.

comment,"1. As current SGA exec, we both can directly see the impact cabinet choices can have on our community. It is **imperative** that cabinet members are chosen based upon merit and not upon any nepotic tendencies. We hold ourselves to a high standard and are fully aware that when appointments are chosen on a merit basis, Cabinet is most effective and, therefore, is the most beneficial to the student body. In order to accomplish this we will prioritize marketing of all cabinet positions to all students, not just current SGA members. The application should be easily accessible and known to students across campus. We will encourage non-SGA members to apply because we know that the executive branch will be stronger with the addition of new and dynamic ideas. Directly answering your question about nepotism: we have not and will not make any promises to students that they will receive an appointed position within SGA next year. All decisions will be made only after a thorough and honest review and interview process for all applicants.
2. Pooja and Haigh's Initiatives and Accomplishments  

   1. Pooja: As VP of IA, my biggest goal has been to create an SGA that members feel comfortable and empowered in. My time in SGA has been impacted by friends and mentors and I wanted to ensure that environment was created for all members, new or young, old or experienced, to the organization. During my time, I have worked to creatively uplift all members of the organization and host events that allow members of each branch of the government to meet. Keeping morale high and prioritizing organizational health enables our output to be strong! Below is a list of some of my accomplishments:  

      1. SGA Retreat: Tripled membership attendance from previous year
      2. All-Branch Meetings: Ideated and executed two of the first ever All-Branch meetings to ensure all members of SGA were aware of the current projects and initiatives in the SGA pipeline
      3. Internal Newsletter: Created a unique internal newsletter to disseminate to all branches of SGA to keep members informed of upcoming dates and highlighting committee projects, such as CDAC‚Äôs Brown Bag series
      4. Committee Chair roundtable: Hosted the first ever committee chair roundtable, to foster a collaborative space among all executive committee chairs, and converse about membership retention and involvement
      5. Safe Space Training: Ensured that all Executive Cabinet members received Safe Space training
      6. ACC Advocacy: Advocated on behalf of Georgia Tech at the ACC Conference in Washington D.C alongside the current undergraduate and graduate SGA President and Executive Vice-President
      7. \*\*These are just several examples and don‚Äôt represent everything my Internal Affairs team has done!\*\*
   2. Haigh: As VP of Academic Affairs my main priority has been to decrease avoidable stressors in the lives of our students‚Äî whether through increased resources accessibility, additional curriculum flexibility, or developing faculty and student relationships. Below I bulleted a list of some of the initiatives I am working on:  

      1. Mini-mesters: a one credit hour 5 week long course meant to give students the opportunity to take breadth courses outside of their major (ex: personal finance, engineering our climate change, invention studio, etc) -- in progress, pilot coming in the fall
      2. Help.gatech.edu: a central resource site for students to access ‚Äòmost frequently asked for‚Äô resources like mental health, campus services, and financial aid -- in progress, beta site being developed
      3. Updating Syllabi Policy: passed policy measures to require professors to post syllabi by the first day of class and post their syllabi on a publically accessible site (ultimate goal is to push for a centralized syllabi depository for archival purposes) -- working on passing additional policy measures that require professors to include a mental health statement and basic information
      4. Revolutionaries: a speaker series that‚Äôs intended to inspire Georgia Tech students with the most accomplished and distinguished members of our faculty and to learn about the path they have taken to become pioneers in their respective fields. As the leaders of tomorrow, it is important for us to see how revolutionaries who are successful in their endeavors got started and how we can replicate that process to someday make our own world-changing contributions -- completed
      5. Build Out GT1000 &amp; APPH Mental Health Curricula: I‚Äôve been working on implementing mental health and wellbeing learning objectives into GT1000 &amp; APPH for new students to learn about mental health resources. -- in progress, currently setting up a roundtable discussion with the Director of GT1000 and the Counseling Center/Psychiatry
      6. \*\*These are just several examples and don't represent everything my Academic Affairs Board and I have done!\*\*
3. Throughout this past year, I do believe that as a cabinet we could have done a better job connecting with students, representing your opinions, and further turning those opinions into actionable items. We **need** more student input to make sure that we are truly representing the study body in our fullest capacity and we would do so through revamping SGA‚Äôs feedback mechanisms. Progress in SGA‚Äôs accountability is paramount when trying to cultivate an active presence on campus, where we would do so by expanding our social media presence, regularly giving updates and conducting AMA‚Äôs on Reddit, implementing bi-weekly tabling for students to visit and give in person feedback, and creating traveling office hours for members of UHR to engage more with our community. We fully recognize that these measures aren‚Äôt enough and are always open to hearing your feedback on how we can better connect and represent the Georgia Tech student body. So how do we turn these opinions into actionable items? With a firm hand and a loud voice ‚Äî Georgia Tech is more receptive to the student voice than most students believe if we are persistent enough. In this past year I‚Äôve been able to accomplish more than I had originally thought because of my firm and diplomatic presence with administrators that has given me credibility. **Persistence is key**.
4. That is a good question! For sake of transparency, we are both Greek and the rhetoric that circulates that SGA is primarily Greek is not false. With that being said, engagement with SGA is low in multiple pockets on campus, and even with some of our closest friends within the Greek sector, we see there is still a disconnect about the inner workings of SGA and what exactly SGA is working on. We plan to close this gap, and not just limit it to the Greek sector, but all of campus. Greek students more often hear about communication from SGA when it is attached to a certain initiative, such as Greek Sustainability, but don‚Äôt hear from us in a consistent and informational manner. In recognizing this pattern in our direct friend circles, we intentionally placed it on our platform - to tangibly assess the means of current communication and to work toward a prioritization of engaging with our constituency.

It‚Äôs no secret at this point that the student body is frustrated with the dining experience on campus, and for good reason. The new dining program, whoever our dining provider ends up being, needs to be a better value-added experience for our students and we want to ensure that we don‚Äôt have a repeat of this year. Here is our platform point that specifically pertains to dining, for reference:

‚Äú**Empower Better Dining Practices:** Prioritize student well-being by advocating for a high-quality, affordable dining program which values nutrition, taste and variety.

* Advocate for inclusive dining options such as vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, allergen-free, low-carb.
* Make progress towards adding more meal plan options in Tech Square.
* Standardize accessible nutritional facts and information provided in dining halls and other campus food vendors.‚Äù

We feel that other campaigns have been unrealistically setting student expectations for a GT Dining initiative. Whether this is because they don't have the people on their campaigns who are directly involved in the discussions with administrators or because they know that these initiatives are popular and likely to garner easy votes, we don't know. Instead of being inflexible about a single (public) solution which may be infeasible due to contract laws (we expand more on that in a previous answer), we will evaluate all the options for how they actually affect students, including their money, time, and health.

2) My third question focused moreso on translating student opinion into actual results, whereas your response focused heavily on student opinion.

We will utilize a communication channel, GECH (as mentioned above) to thoroughly understand the student opinion. GECH is an initial start to an open and accessible SGA. On the other hand, we will educate ourselves with what administrative perspective is to articulate not just what the students feel, but also why we feel the way we do and provide data and improvement ideas to truly convey a productive tone. We believe that with new administration, a new student tone must be fostered in order to enact the most productive change.  
2. As student leaders, we want to ensure that each component of our platform is not only actionable, but also has means to be tangibly tracked. Short term action items will lead to the long-term benefits that as you stated may not be realized in one-years time.

comment,"1. Mini-mesters arose out of the Creating the Next in Education (CNE) and was not originally an SGA initiative. My predecessor for VPAA laid the groundwork on receiving funding and establishing a relationship with the administration on this initiative; however, there had been little work done on the policies surrounding the development of the program and the actual courses themselves. Even though this was an initiative started before my time in cabinet, there was a lot more groundwork to cover. First of all, we all know that the administration at times ‚Äòdrops the ball‚Äô on initiatives and can ‚Äòget too busy‚Äô because they have so many different commitments. Last fall I began a series of listening sessions with almost every single school on campus to create buy-in to the pilot program and to solicit ideas for MMs. Unknown to most students, there was actually pushback from certain schools due to a lack of funding for faculty stipends. I had to push hard and advocate for the benefits of this program for students (because there are so many!) and get schools to sign onto this initiative. Through that process my Academic Affairs Board and I were able to facilitate up to 9 (a couple still in flux) MMs being created for this Fall. We‚Äôve poured countless hours into this project and quite a lot of work went into advocating and working with the administration (who were unresponsive at times). This semester we also were able to work with the Registrar's office to develop a MM academic calendar, MM approval sub-committee within IUCC, and establish guidelines for participating schools. Excited to see this come to fruition this fall!
2. If you know Pooja and I you know that we mean what we say and speak with total honesty. We decided to run relatively last minute, and the reason why is because our peers within SGA had faith in us, as we are both very action-oriented.

comment,"Responding to this- I'm the person who's been speaking with administrators that's been cited.

Nate, while I understand where you're coming from, just being the person who wrote the resolution doesn't mean you've continued to stay in the loop, especially since you told me you didn't have the time to continue with it.

I'm going to approach this from a completely neutral angle. Disclaimer: while I am on Pooja and Haigh's campaign team I in no way intend to express support or go against *any* campaign in stating the following. All I want is for students to get what's best, and personally I actually think self-op would be what's best for students. I also would like to stop the spread of misinformation going around, as it complicates things a lot when it comes time to talk with administrators.

Now, the problem is that if this resolution had been passed in, say, August, then it likely would've made huge progress with the administration. Now, due to the way Georgia procurement laws work (if anyone's curious about which specific ones, I'm happy to send links!), we're having to work around NDAs, people who work for the state of Georgia rather than GT, and the lawsuit. On top of this, we have no idea when the contract's actually going to be signed. I'll be meeting with administrators on Thursday, at which point they plan on releasing an official statement in response to the resolution. I've also been told that there's a good chance they'll be telling us why they can't switch to self-op. Another concern I have is that I'm already seeing Aramark things around campus- for example, at the science teachers fair there were Aramark boxes present. I'm not sure if that was coincidental or because something has happened and administrators haven't told me yet. For reference, I've called the procurement office 4 times, emailed them 4 times, and shown up to their office and they haven't talked to me once since January. It's an absolute pain trying to even get in touch with some of these people. It also took three weeks to get a meeting with our VP of Campus Services, which is why the Thursday meeting didn't happen earlier.

Of course, being told we can't switch isn't going to be what's ideal but I plan on preparing for the worst case scenario. In the instance that they tell us they can't do self-op, I will happily sit there and refuse to leave until they give a clear, reasonable, and thorough response for why it's not a possibility. We have evidence from a multitude of other schools that switching to self-op is possible, the only thing that's getting in our way is the timing. 

I'll be sending out a post on Reddit asking for specific questions or points students would like to be brought up during those meetings. Feel free to spam that with anything from bug photos to rotten apples to high prices. I am under no obligation to make the administrators like me during that meeting, and will not hesitate to bombard them with reasons for why we should make the change.

comment,"If research is what you want to do, then go for it. The MSE department only really cares about research, so if you are considering industry at any point, prepare to be screwed. If you do want to go into industry, it is probably better to do chemical engineering or mechanical engineering since most jobs involving MSE will ask for those degrees anyways. The job that I got has me listed as a chemical engineer. As an MSE, you are going to be very surface level for a lot of the tools you will need in industry. Even if research is what you want to do, I would still do chemical or mechanical engineering and work with an MSE professor for research. The MSE department is incredibly incompetent, and the structure of the curriculum puts most of the MSE on the back end, so by the time you figure out you hate MSE, it is too late to switch.


Firstly, registering is always a pain. You cannot register on your own. You have to go through advising or group advising first since they can't structure a proper schedule to give freedom of choice. You are pretty much stuck taking a few classes at a few times since some classes which end up being required for graduation are only offered in either the spring or the fall, despite there being plenty of students willing to take it in other semesters. The department always asks for feedback and everyone who I have ever known has suggested this, yet Dr. Realff and Dr. Thadhani (the undergraduate chairs) refuse to listen. For most of your classes, there is only going to be one section and one professor, so if you don't like the time or the professor, you are screwed. For thermo, there is only Speyer, and most people thought it was a shitty class (I liked it, but everyone learns differently, and it's nice to have options). For MSE 2021, it is only Garmestani and Alamgir who are awful professors who clearly could not care less about teaching a class. It is lazily taught through half-assed powerpoints and clicker questions, and the lab for that course is passed on to maybe one competent GTA and a bunch of other incompetent UTA's who will never help. Other classes generally interfere with each other, so if you don't take certain classes by a certain time, you are screwed for graduation (I have a friend who has been here for 6 years, no fault of his own, just very difficult to schedule co-op and classes). The department didn't care and did not even offer the ability to do independent study. Shirley and the other advisors suck too, you won't get anything useful from talking to them. From Dr. Realff's own words, I overheard her say that, ""Shirley never does anything right."" Renita Washington is chill though; she is the only competent member of that clusterfuck. You have a lack of options as an MSE, and that has been arguably my most frustrating aspect of being an MSE. 


Secondly, labs in MSE. They suck. Plain and simple. They are trying to revamp the labs, and while it is easier to make an A, and they are finally more clear in what they expect, but the lab instruction is still sub-par. You would not be able to enter industry involving those lab skills with the education you receive. You are better off learning the skills on your own in research. I did not do undergraduate research, so I made a fool out of myself at several job interviews when asked about labs and characterization. The technical writing aspect is also weak. Dr. Gable will tell you a bunch of rules for your report that you cannot violate and always claims that you will never see a journal article that does not follow the instructions she lays out. Spoiler alert: you will never find a journal that complies to Dr. Gable's rules as each journal has their own rules of submission. Dr. Gable is out of touch, like many MSE professors.



Thirdly, there is no industry focus. You are going to have a harder time finding a job without a stellar GPA than a chemical or mechanical engineer. Period. At the MSE career fair, half of the companies are looking for graduate students, so you have to be a strong competitor relative to your peers. As I also mentioned, at the general career fair, most jobs involving MSE already want a chemical or mechanical engineer, since they have more focused and directed skillsets. Being an MSE and trying to find a job is like shooting yourself in the foot. Oh, and to anyone saying that MSE has a high job placement rate, keep in mind that statistic does not include those who sought jobs and then went into graduate school. How many people do you know decided to do grad school because they couldn't find a decent job? Too many.



Fourthly, senior design is the worst. The first senior design is the most bullshit marketing class possible. I wanted to drop that class so bad since I just never wanted to hear the professor, Jayaraman, mention his stupid smart shirt ever again. Have you ever heard of a smart shirt? Is it ever used in industry? No, so be prepared to hear about how the smart shirt is the greatest fucking design and how it's going to fucking change the world. This class is Jayaraman victory lap for keeping his job for 30 years. You will not learn anything other than to be frustrated with administrative bullshit. Does a design need at least 60 user needs? No, but you you're going to have to come up with it anyways. Do you need to focus on ITY's for everything? No, because there is more to design than just the terms Jayarman coined and what's in the bullshit textbook anyways. The class is also backloaded, so you are going to do nothing until thanksgiving break and then prepare to write 80 pages of bullshit last minute while you are stressed with midterms and everything else. It could have been more spread out, but Jayarman does not know how to schedule. Attendance is required because Jayarman wants you to hear his bullshit every MWF and during a 3 hour lab period on Friday. Get ready for bullshit if you make it to senior as an MSE.


The senior design 2 is not much better. Again, why do we need 2 senior designs? I learned nothing in the first senior design that is not covered in the second. I opted to take interdisciplinary senior design this semester (thank god), and I have never experience such low stress. My advisor is understanding and recognizes that each problem is unique, and you cannot design everything the same way. MSE however, is bullshit. They ask you to form teams and bid on projects during the middle of stressful midterm week after thanksgiving break. They ask you to fill out Strengthsfinder, which is a bullshit survey poll that tells you things about yourself like whether you're a visionary or futuristic, or woo, or whatever bullshit they peddle. This is now the cornerstone of your peer reviews. You're gonna talk about this bullshit a lot, and attendance is required even when you don't do anything. Thank god I avoided that this semester since I have a really chill senior design in which I am learning new skills and not frustrated with pointless crap. 


Lastly, MSE 2001 and MSE 1111 are going to give you a weird idea of what MSE is and what to do with it. They are classes that need strong curriculum changes since you will learn everything in MSE 2001 in higher detail later, so it's just going to be a bullshit class you will probably hate and have a hard time making an A in. MSE is a lot easier to do as a ChemE or MechE, so I hope you don't drink the kool-aid like I did and honestly consider MSE. They try to sell MSE at a lot of recruitment events because it is a small major, but you will find it is not all sunshine in this major.


The main reason it is higher ranked is because it is the largest school of MSE in the nation. This, however, does not mean it is the best since that comes with many drawbacks. It used to be metallurgy, ceramics, and polymer and textiles. A lot of the jobs I applied to had said that since I am an MSE, I am too general, and they would have preferred me to be specifically metallurgy, or specifically ceramics. Most of the polymer places I applied to said they wanted a chemical engineer. There is one alloys class, most metallurgy programs have at least 3. There is one ceramics class, most ceramics programs will have at least 3 classes. There are plenty of polymer and textile electives, since PTFE was the largest school to merge into MSE.


Try to avoid MSE if you can. It is much easier to switch as an entering freshman. You can still do everything an MSE does as a MechE or ChemE. Just trying to save you some hassle and bullshit. I love Materials Science as a topic, but in hindsight, I now realize I could have done everything I wanted and more with less bullshit and more opportunities as a ChemE or MechE.",Negative,"mse, curriculum, research, industry, registration, labs, job placement, senior design, recruitment.",3,2019-03-12

Mini-Mesters are definitely happening!

To answer your question of what type of classes MMs will be: Our long term vision for MMs is that they will include brand new curriculum topics and also supplement current courses within degree programs across campus. Mini-Mesters are designed to have no pre-reqs and open to students across campus to allow for interdisciplinary education. For the pilot program this Fall all of the classes we will be offering will be brand new topics! Examples of some of the titles of these courses will include ‚ÄúThe Deep Ocean,‚Äù ‚ÄúEngineering our Climate Future,‚Äù ‚ÄúPersonal Finance,‚Äù ‚ÄúApplications of Fluid Dynamics,‚Äù and ‚ÄúOverview of Programming Languages.‚Äù In the future we hope to see MM courses that include certifications and trainings (think excel, salesforce, solidworks) that will prepare students for real world work experiences. Additionally, I have already had conversations with school chairs exploring the idea of supplementing current traditional 15 week long courses with a MM (for 1 or 2 credit hour courses) or a series of MMs (allowing for schedule flexibility and personalization).

I am so excited to hear that you are interested in MMs! Make sure to be on the lookout in the next few weeks from SGA for information on how to register for these courses!

Seems like that's a solvable problem? I commuted my last two years from Marietta. I built in an hour of extra time to account for traffic. Wasn't much fun, but I was rarely late. Can you work on this part of the problem? If you go in there with not only an explanation but a start of a solution, that talk will go much better. 

In general, professors can't/don't offer extra credit on a case by case basis, it should be at the class level - this is something relatively closely policed by the university to ensure fairness standards. What I suspect is that she's flagged you since your performance to date isn't up to par and she wants to make sure you know what resources are available to you - whether that's tutoring, study groups, office hours, or if you need to be connected to institutional resources such as dean of students or disability services. 

Firstly, address your attendance problem. Secondly, figure out what isn't making sense to you in the course and determine how to learn it better or differently.

He initially didnt have an open position but after a hour or 3 of talking about his work and my obviously uninformed position on the topic, he told me to come back next week and he'll see what he could dig up. That's how I got my current research gig trying to chart optimal times for starting long term modeling simulations on Georgia Tech's own shared parallel processor PACE.

It was weird came across like your not fucked, but there won't be any leniency. I asked for extra work which was a no go. I went over the test with him and there was nothing I could get extra points on.

Telling you not to drop is basically a way of telling you he's going to curve without explicitly admitting as much so the students don't hear about it and stop trying.  Under a strict interpretation of what he said, he could curve the midterm just not the final grades too.  Extra work is pretty much a no-fly in grad school in my experience, but I suppose it might depend on the prof/situation.  

Assuming normal distribution, if the mean was 72 and std dev was 20, this means ~68% of the class scored between 52-92, so then of the remainder about 16% each were above and below those limits.  So roughly speaking you're in pretty good shape.  If you were below 52 you'd need to be more worried.

Just keep putting in an honest effort and you'll be fine.  Unless it's a critical capstone course or such for your program they're not going to keep you from graduating for one ""bad"" midterm grade that wasn't really all that bad.

comment,"At high angle of attack, high G-loads and low-airspeed( think 60deg bank turn as ur turning base to final approach), the mcas system kicks in which has been blamed for these recent events. The 737Max exhibits a slight nose up moment in certain rare configurations making it statically unstable to longitudinal perturbations. Not sure how bad it is but I'm sure it's small . To fix that issue, they coded the flight controls to trim the nose down in such configurations to prevent a stall and spin out from excessive manhandling of the controls. The pilot can override the system by manual trim. Now, that's the system and situation. Everything after this is speculative. People are speculating that in these situations, pilots aren't aware of the fact that they have a natural pitch up motion rather than a more stable pitch down which would inherently dampen the motion. If they trim manually, the system disengages the mcas feature without informing them what's going on. Considering all accidents were after takeoff at ""low"" airspeed( remember this is all speculation) and a low energy state, people believe the mcas system takes over and either malfunctions or stops working once the pilots starts manual trimming the aircraft. People are complaining pilots weren't told about this feature in the flight manuals. Boeing argues mcas is designed for situations that shouldn't really be within a part 121 flight operation anyways and didn't think all that info was necessary. A lot of this is speculation, ntsb has not even put out a prelim yet. So, chill and go fly. Accidents happened in countries with airlines with not necessary the best training and pilots onboard. Getting into this situation is  highly unlikely if you are flying in the conus.",Negative,"aviation, mcas",1,2019-03-13
comment,"TL;DR: boeing changed locations of the max's engines, landing gear, etc. this could cause the plane to tilt too far upward during flight. installed a system to combat that issue, but didn't properly inform pilots about the system &amp; system has known sensor errors. sensor errors cause system to ""stabilize"" plane but actually bring plane nose down too far causing a nose dive.

\-

not an AE (i'm ME) but basically the 737 max is designed to be super fuel efficient. therefore, the engines on the max are larger and a lot more fuel efficient, but to make sure they could fit this on the plane, they moved the engines forward &amp; higher up, which also slightly changed the location of the landing gear.

this little change affected how the max acts in flight sometimes. the new locations of engines and gear &amp; new nacelle shape caused the plane's nose to sometimes go too far skyward/upward.

controversy arose after Boeing added a system to address this called the MCAS or maneuvering characteristics augmentation system. the goal of the system was to help pilots get the nose back down if the plane's angle of attack ever got too high when the jet was flying manually (since this could cause the plane to stall). the issue is, Boeing didn't really include info about this system in any manuals before the Lion Air disaster in October, and lots of pilots say they weren't adequately trained in it, didn't know about it, etc.

now, in theory this system is fine and shouldn't cause any huge problems. the MCAS is only supposed to turn on when the sensors in the system detect that the angle of attack is too high ""based on the airspeed and altitude"" of the plane. then when it's activated, it should stabilize the plane based on some AE stuff that I don't know about.

however, the whole issue is that apparently, the max's are having some sensor issues. therefore, the plane could be at a perfectly normal angle of attack, but if the sensors are reading that it's too high, the MCAS kicks in (in the Lion Air case, the pilot may not have even known what was happening since people were inadequately warned about this new system) and starts pushing the nose of the plane down. depending on the error of the sensor, this can cause the system to push the jet's nose WAY too far down, basically sending the plane nose dive &amp; causing the catastrophe with Lion Air, and possible this Ethiopian crash as well (the two crashes are extremely similar, so I wouldn't be surprised).

again i'm not an AE so sorry if any of this is incorrect, this is just what I've found searching around on the internet",Negative,"boeing, 737 max, mcas, sensor errors, controversy, safety.",30,2019-03-13

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, GT freshman dorms are set up in a traditional style, meaning that you live in a room with at least one or three people(2 to 4 people per room) and then have a communal bathroom.

&amp;#x200B;

More on specific dorms/East versus West:

One thing you have to considered when choosing dorms is East Campus versus West Campus.

Benefits of East Campus:

\-Closer to most Freshman classes(Skiles, Clough, Architecture)

\-Closer to more dining options on Freshman meal plan(North Ave and Brittain)

\-More lively side of campus(close to football stadium/frat and sorority houses)

\-More freshman live on East Campus because there is more freshman housing 

Benefits of West Campus:

\-Quieter

\-Slightly larger rooms

\-West Village(this is in the middle; newest dining hall, but its really a mixed experience)

&amp;#x200B;

 On specific dorms:

Try to get into newer/newly renovated dorms. The most commonly desired dorms are Glenn or Towers because they are the most recently renovated; I haven't lived in either dorm, but had a friend in Towers, and it seemed nice. Avoid Smith at all costs(these three dorms are on East). Montag, Fitten and Freeman are all pretty nice on West Campus.

&amp;#x200B;

Living with people who are the same major as you:

I personally don't know where the majority of IDs live and most times Freshman dorms are a grab bag of majors unless you live in a specific living learning community(if I remember correctly though, the only LLC that was major specific was for science majors). You might be able to find someone on a Facebook page(idk if one exists, but usually there is one) and possible message them to be your roommate, but I feel that a lot of freshman just go potluck and hope for the best.

comment,"&gt; these are normal reactions and what make us human

The amount of stress and worry felt by the average Tech student is far, far in excess of what's 'normal'. I've worked hard to greatly reduce my level of academic stress, and I can say that at least 95% of academic stress felt by the average student is unnecessary and unhealthy. 

The main problem, in my experience, is a highly inaccurate judgement of the consequences of failing a test. You're activating a system in your brain that's meant to keep you alive in a saber-tooth tiger attack. In that scenario, yes, it would be normal and healthy to experience stress.

But the modern world gives us many ersatz stressors that activate this fight-or-flight system. Learning to ascertain correctly what's a genuine hazard and what isn't greatly reduces stress. Most things that set off the stress mechanism in the average student don't need to.

Another thing to consider is that the feeling of stress and worry actually makes your academic performance *worse*. You're wasting mental energy on stress and worry that you could be devoting to the task at hand.

comment,"College the way we know it will be gone, as soon as the credential mechanism starts to shift towards different institutions where people focus on learning rather than just competing for spots in institutions who pride them self in how exclusive they are.  We already see a downward slope in number of applicants  applying to traditional colleges.  This is currently  happening, traditional universities are already trying different models because they don‚Äôt want to be left behind when this shift occur.

comment,"&gt; We already see a downward slope in number of applicants applying to traditional colleges.

What are you talking about? Take a look at the numbers published by GT: https://irp.gatech.edu/archival-fact-book. The number of applicates are rising every year. Acceptance rates are falling like a rock. It was +30% only 5 years ago now it's reaching T20 levels of rejection.

&gt; traditional universities are already trying different models because they don‚Äôt want to be left behind when this shift occur

I highly doubt a major shift to online education. Academia is notorious for being extremely conservative in education. When I took a couple classes back in UCSD, professors were still using blackboards and chalk. Yes, the topics may be changing as new inventions and methods are discovered and the college system will become more competitive and cutthroat in admissions. However, college education changes slower then trying to do something new in the nuclear industry. Im pretty sure the latest innovation in college education was the Powerpoint presentation so professors dont have to write everything down on a board.",Negative,college education,4,2019-03-13

Again these are not my ideas but they are discussed at highs levels and different models  of delivering education  are currently tried ...as soon as more employers will start to hire people that haven‚Äôt gone through the traditional route we will see prospect students choosing those alternative versus current ones. Look at what is GT currently is doing to improve the educational quality in undergrad...NOTHING. That is not something they care about they do care about credentials and being whatever spot in college news and rankings;  likewise students care about signaling that they went to whatever college. Truth is that signaling  doesn‚Äôt correlate with actual learning

For sure someone up top is trying to find a way to capitalize on the inflating applicant number and stagnant acceptance numbers and online education looks like the most probable option. Still, the core of the college model has and probably will remain in person lectures. As I said, academia has immense inertia behind it and changing the course of the field will require a breaking distance of an modern oil tanker.","Negative

&gt; The CmpE degree is in the process of working with the College of Computing to increase the availability of CS courses to CmpE students. As a result, ECE3056 (Comp Arch, Concurr, Energy) was modified for Fall 2018 to include more content that would allow CmpE students to use it in place of CS2200 (Intro Comp Sys and Networks) where CS2200 is listed as a prerequisite. The change in content was significant enough require a course number change from ECE3056 to ECE3057 to distinguish students who had taken previous offerings from those taking the revised course.

&gt;A committee of CmpE and CS faculty have worked to assist CmpE students with meeting pre-requisite requirements for more CS courses. One of the primary courses in the pre-requisite chain is CS2200 which is similar to ECE3056 with the exception of a few key pieces of content. The joint CmpE/CS committee arrived at the conclusion that it would make better sense to add certain content to ECE3056 rather than require students to take CS2200 where some material from ECE3056 would be duplicated. Therefore, ECE3057 was created as a new course and requires a degree modification to the degree.",Neutral,"education, curriculum, collaboration.",6,2019-03-14

comment,"Really really depends on what threads you want to go for. Different classes go for different languages, based on what specializations/libraries they need.

Intro classes:

* CS 1301 - Probably a class you're going to skip if you already have an AP CS class, but uses Python/HTML to introduce people to coding
* CS 1331 - The main CS intro course, intro to Object-Oriented using Java
* CS 1332 - Data Structures (in Java)
* CS 1371 - CS course for non-CS engineers, in MATLAB

Now, for threads (if you're not familiar with threads, you basically choose two threads to branch your major into, depending on what you're interested in. Take a look [here](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/bachelors/computer-science/threads) for some basic info):

* Devices - since you're dealing with low-level hardware, you'll probably be coding mostly in different variants of Assembly.
* Info InterNetworks - classes here tend to be pretty spread out in languages, allowing you to use whichever you prefer. Certain classes (CS 2110, CS 2200) will teach you Assembly/C, but other than that, as long as you know either one of C/Java/Python
* Intel - As yhsre points out, Python is a pretty big one here, since a lot of ML is done in Python
* Media - Almost everything with web or graphics is going to be done in some variant of JavaScript (look into variants like TypeScript, Angular, React, Vue)
* ModSim - Typically a mix of C and Python
* People - the least ""coding"" kind of thread, focused more on human psychology. Regardless, you're gonna be looking at graphics, so JavaScript is a plus
* SysArch - C and Assembly, and a whole lot of it
* Theory - again, not much ""coding"" since it's mostly mathematical theory behind algorithms, but having a mix of C and Python helps

**TL;DR** really depends on what you wanna focus on. If you wanna do graphics/front-end/UI stuff, JavaScript is a must-have. ML/AI/Intel, Python is your best bet.

* You should go to office hours to work on your homework instead of spending eight hours on it and not sleeping. Not sleeping has a cumulative effect and makes you stupid. When you are stupid, you work slower and worse. Your professors will occasionally make you feel very dumb for asking stupid questions. It's okay. You *were* dumb. Then they answered, and you stopped being dumb. You aren't supposed to know everything about everything by yourself. That is the whole reason you pay so much money to this institution.

If you are fairly experienced with programming, then you want the ""C++ Primer"". It covers everything. Literally everything. But not everything in complete depth, nor does it cover the best practices. It will get you from programmer of another language to a C++ programmer. It is also not a beginner programming book.

If you are still shaky on the fundamentals, then you probably want something like Deitel and Deitel's ""C++ How to Program"". That's what I got started with as a teen.

Reading a book will not make you into a good c++ programmer, nor will it get you a job. To do both, you must solve a problem with a c++ program that you wrote. Doesn't matter too much what the problem is, or how you solve it; it matters that you write code that works. 

You could also try to contribute to an open source project, but that will likely be beyond your skills for a little while. C++ programmers tend to be even more ""esoteric"" and ""clever"" with their code than other language programmers. As such, you'll come across code that will, quite literally, be black magic. If you accept the challenge and become a C++ developer, please don't be clever. Boring code is good code.

I love working with C++. It is hard, but I enjoy the challenge. And making my critical path code blazing fast with all the optimizations you can do in the language feels so good.

comment,"As far as the material is concerned, you really only need to walk away from these classes with a good sense of how to take derivatives and integrals. Anything else you can just look up when you need it.

But as an aside, that‚Äôs hardly the reason we have to take these classes as engineering students. They are introductory problem solving courses that require you to exercise your analytical and critical thinking skills. Every engineer should be exposed to these ideas early on, and calculus is a good framework for it that does not require domain-specific knowledge particular to each major. The same goes for most of the low-level STEM courses (physics, chemistry, statics/dynamics). 

I apologize if my post has a defensive tone, and I don‚Äôt mean to anticipate the intent of your question, but many freshmen/sophomores tend to be confused by this practice in engineering curricula (e.g. ‚Äúthis is such a waste of time, I‚Äôm never going to use this‚Äù). As a grad student and now practicing engineer, I can‚Äôt recall a time ever using concepts from Intro Physics II since I took that class in 2012 - but it definitely showed me a wide set of techniques for approaching problems of a certain type.

She was at KSU when they transitioned from contracting to self-op, so we're hoping she may have some additional insight.

At this point, our biggest obstacle is the outcome of the protest period/lawsuit currently happening with the dining RFP. I will expand more on this in our future post. 

If anyone thinks it would help to have an open forum, let me know and I'd be happy to do that following spring break.

But like for medical school, GT students *might* be at a mild disadvantage because GPAs tend to be lower, an especially critical factor for law school admissions (GPA and LSAT score are 90+% of what gets you in).  If you're applying to Emory, UGA, GSU etc they will probably know to cut some slack but not all schools will.  This of course becomes moot if you go to Tech and get a high GPA too, but that's no guarantee.

&gt;We also want a class who studies a variety of disciplines, so the major you put on your application and evidence of your interest in this major is an indicator of how you would fit in the upcoming class. These are examples of institutional priorities, and how factors outside of your GPA and test scores will affect your admission decision.

From [another part](http://admission.gatech.edu/first-year/major-selection) of the Admissions site:

&gt;During our holistic review process we consider many factors, including the major listed on  your application.

They're both worded exactly like the transfer admissions site, and they absolutely do look at your major for transfers. We still don't ""admit by major"" for freshman at least, but they do consider it.

There was also one year where they brought in IAC/CoS faculty to help review those applications for those specific majors (I'll try to dig that blog post up later), and they seem to have a vested interest in increasing enrollment in those colleges.

comment,"&gt;find a new apartment in a new city about a 4 hour drive from here

The only advice I can offer here is if you can find any kind of 1-2 month temp housing (even if it's not ideal) then you have time to find an apartment as you are working-- you'll get more familiar with the new location and thus have a better idea of the best place to live, you might be more flexible on move in date and score a better deal, and you'll make some money for the various deposits you'll need.

&gt;I‚Äôll get reimbursed up to $2000 for relocation, but it‚Äôd be damn useful if I could get that up front

It's worth asking, isn't it? I know that some employers have programs to put you up in temp housing and/or pre-pay some of the relocation expenses for people in your exact position.

comment,"I would see if your employer has a moving program that you can set up the move through. Google has a credit program where they will allocate you X amount of credits which can be applied to having your car shipped, apartment packed, etc. I believe that my employer has a deal like that through a moving company minus the whole credit system thing. However, the company my employer uses wanted $4000 for a 90 mile move where instead I was able to get it done for $1700 through another company (I still got reimbursed for the $1500 I was originally allocated).

&amp;#x200B;

If you live close to your employer, then you may not need a car. That can help cut down on your upfront expenses. Just make sure you take the time to research where you are going to live.

&amp;#x200B;

As for everything else, just make sure you are allocating yourself enough time to do these things. If you have any favors left to call in a Tech, now would be a good time to do so.

comment,"As far as housing -- ask your employer for the money up front, as well as any recommendation for neighborhoods to start looking. I'd rent a room in an older person's home as opposed to trying to find something on craigslist or the like. Wait until you're there and can get settled in temporarily until you find something more permanent. Nothing is worse than a terrible roommate.

Learn to cook well on a dirt cheap budget. Work a couple of temporary, low commitment jobs that that will pay you enough money to buffer your bank account. Learn to use coupons religiously and find the cheapest everything.

It's hard, but you'll figure it out. It is good practice for when you start having to pay back those student loans!  


EDIT:  
I wanted to clarify my recommendation on finding a room with an older/elderly person. My experience has been that these rental relationships are mutually beneficial both socially and financially, are often more flexible in their terms (e.g. more flexible on commitment, reasonable on rates, and probably open to exchanging work around the house for discounted room), and generally can be rewarding if you are an altruistic person. Then again, when I was a kid, I used to read to folks in the nursing home, so I don't find this option unusual, especially if you want a quiet place to come home to for a little while in a new city.

First, I would determine a list of what you want out of an apartment. Do you want laundry in unit, hardwood, ceiling fans, etc? Filter apartments by these criteria within your alotted budget (usually under 1/3 of income towards rent if at all possible). Narrow down to a good list of 3-5 apartments that look good to you on paper via googling and research. Then drive to the city and spend a full day going around and looking at the apartments. You may need to rent a car for the weekend to do this, or see if a friend wants to take a road trip.


In regards to buying a car, try and find a cheap used car that would be reliable. Probably a toyota corolla or something similar.


For actual moving, in all of my moves (undergrad to job, job to grad school, and soon to be grad school to new job) I like to move in a week or two before the job starts so I can get used to the new area and settle in.


For expenses, I was fortunate to have my parents help me with covering a truck for the first move. I also had to stay in an extended stay hotel for 2 weeks until I could move into an apartment ($39 a night or something). For the 2nd move, I had money saved from the job.

Most GT students have never worked or have limited co-op experience.  The only way to weed through applicants with no relative experience is to look at GPA.  Once you work a little you won't likely ever be asked your GPA again.

One thing that helped me was to talk with the profs.  Note that this only works if you have been in class, participated, and showed that you are actually trying.

It doesn't make things any easier to get through, but you are definitely no alone.  I still have nightmares about that place.  Wake up thinking I have an exam that I forgot to study for....ugh.

First, I'd check all the transfer requirements, especially classes needed for your desired major at Tech, [https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/application-requirements](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/application-requirements); then check the transfer equivalencies for other classes that would help you, like the right CS classes that would actually transfer from Oglethorpe [https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P\_find\_location](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_location) and also basic English classes and whatever; and then talk to Oglethorpe and see what would be required of you to get those classes on your schedule and just build around that. I would also suggest you attend one of the transfer info sessions that Tech offers to make sure you understand everything. Grades are key, and if you can get a 3.7 you have a good shot.

I'd barely call what you do in 2211/2 programming tbh. Yes, you do write some rudimentary Python code, but it's more akin to converting formulas to Python syntax than ""real"" programming, and many of the 2212 labs don't even involve any code. Imo you won't learn any programming skills by taking physics that you couldn't teach yourself over a week. If you already have experience programming, you won't learn anything new.

&gt;*** DO NOT ASK ABOUT 2340/2110/1332 COMBINATION. Answer to that question: It is doable but hard. I would suggest to take two one semester and one another semester. If you must take them together, do not pair them with a hard course. NOW DO NOT SPAM THE GROUP WITH IT. ***

One top of that, you're adding CS 2050 (which is a decent amount of work due to the weekly problem sets) AND PHYS 2212.

Physics 2 Modern (E&amp;M) is a killer because of the weekly webassigns and the 3 hour lab. You probably know this cuz you're taking Physics 1, but the labs can be anywhere from 1hr to 3hrs depending on your group and lab TA.

1332 is 1.5 hrs of recitation/wk. 2050 is 1.5 hrs of recitation/wk. 2110 is 3 hrs of lab wk. 2212 is 3 hrs of lab/wk.

That's a total of 24 hours of lecture, recitation, and lab per week.

For 2110 and 1332, you should probably budget 15 hours each for studying and projects (this might be a bit generous but the projects and assessments in the latter half of those classes can be quite difficult). For 2050, 2212, and 2340 you can probably budget 5 hrs/wk each (depending on the strength of your 2340 group and how good at math you are). That's 45 hours of out of class time a week.

&gt;CS 1332 (3 credit hours)

A bitchy class. My least favorite class at Tech to date. I hated HB, the exams kinda sucked, and the projects were overly pedantic. In hindsight, start those projects early so you can pass/write test cases. Didn't show up to class, got a C.

Not as bitchy but you have to play by Monica's bullshit rules. I'd suggest 2051 instead personally so you don't have to deal with her. Besides that, you've never done math like this before, I'd recommend reading ""Book of Proof"" (available free online) before taking the class, it'll give you an extra edge going in.

I got to see some of the labs and it definitely seems like something that I wouldn't recommend taking unless you're forced to/ really want to. 

I took EAS 1601 w/ Reinhardt and 2600 with Grantham freshman year. 1601 is fairly interesting if you like space stuff and Reinhardt was an incredible professor (he's the only professor I've ever had that didn't require attendance and had a full lecture hall the whole year). Even if Reinhardt isn't teaching whenever you check, I'd still recommend going with that class because the material is mainly review if you've taken a science class every year in high school and it's interesting. The tests are fairly straightforward and simple, so as long as you take a look before the tests you should pretty much be good. The only thing shitty about the class is the labs. The labs are compete wastes of time and just feel monotonous to get through. Overall though it was by the the best non-core class I took.

2600 on the other hand, is a class that I would definitely recommend not taking. Not only is the class boring as shit (they don't call if rocks for jocks for nothing), but it also has the shittiest professor I've ever had. Ms. Grantham basically babbles at you in monotone for an hour and a half. Also the exams are 80 questions long and you're basically expected to memorize and match different vocab words with rocks and stuff like that. She tells you exactly what to study for the most part, but it's kind of a lot to memorize. The labs are also really similar to 1601 (Ms. Grantham is actually the lab coordinator for both classes), but slightly worse. Instead of studying what makes it possible for life to exist on other planets, you study rocks and rivers and shit.

That being said, I want to offer some advice on the way you approached it. My goal is not to piss you off but to give you a small glimpse into the way you may come across to others. Most of this post comes across as arrogant, impatient, and patronizing. Here's why:

- You start off by saying this post is polarizing. Nope. You should make this sound like *every* EE's dream. 

- 'Elevate the human condition' uh-huh...

- You label Steam and Netflix as exploitation. Have you heard of GameStop and Comcast? Show respect for the work of others, these companies are not the enemy. They were started by and employ people who are wildly successful and should be looked to for inspiration. 
- You over-specify for a candidate that's not greedy. No where on this post does do you indicate that your ideas are close to profitable. Furthermore, you don't even say what your ideas are so anyone interested is taking a leap of faith out of intellectual curiosity and nothing else.

- At the end, you say ""by some miracle I haven't scared you off' lol wtf. The only people this post will attract are stiff, high-minded individuals. A far cry from your desire for someone enjoyable to be around. I bet there was some smart, chill EE reading this post and debating whether or not you would be too /r/iamverysmart  to deal with. 

I see this too often at Tech where very smart people with good ideas are left to their own devices because they can't communicate. You should have tried to get people really excited about what you're doing and then get picky.

Honestly, seeking outside help is the key. If you‚Äôre going to be in a position where money is less of an issue, I‚Äôd say seek talk to both a psychiatrist (people who can write prescriptions) and a talk therapist (talks with you and teaches behavioral techniques). For me, seeing the therapist regularly made the biggest difference, but figure out what works best for you. 


Suicidal ideation is one of my personal red flags, so as someone who‚Äôs been there before, please don‚Äôt take it lightly. Go to gt counseling as soon as you can. They‚Äôre nowhere near perfect, but it‚Äôs a bandaid until you‚Äôre employed and under a good health insurance plan.


Recovery is not a straight road, there‚Äôs plenty of ups and downs. The key is to have people who know what they‚Äôre doing and allow them to show you a better path forward. 


Edit: please be careful going to Europe. That sort of exploration can be incredibly cathartic and healing, but sometimes also very isolating.

comment,"Hey man! I've been in a very similar situation. Waking up every morning happy, actually doing well in classes, socializing, not drinking to excess, working out, etc. 

And yet sometimes those intrusive thoughts pop into your head. Screaming at you that life is pointless, we're all gonna die, and that you'll never get out of tech so might as well just off yourself now right? Nope! 

The important part is to remember that those are *intrusive* thoughts that don't necessarily reflect your state of being. My intrusive thoughts are always about death and they can get pretty scary and dark sometimes, but I know that isn't an accurate depiction of the way my brain works 95% of the time.

Getting past intrusive thoughts can be extremely difficult and vary person to person, but I find that a couple things in general help:

1. Meditation - 
You don't have to sit there and cross your legs and go ohmmmm, but if you can get to a point that you can sit in silence and control your thoughts and emotions for even 10 minutes a day, it can give you a lot of control over youe thoughts at other times!

2. Mindfulness - 
Be aware of everything you're doing and why you're doing it. Don't fall into the trap of being a drone and going through the motions. Mindlessness leads to a wandering and day dreaming brain that can easily be invaded by intrusive thoughts.

3. Friends - 
Talk to your friends because even though you're embarrassed, they've probably dealt with something similar. Intrusive thoughts are scary, but you don't have to be severely depressed to have them. Don't be afraid to show weakness, for if they're truly your friends they will see it more as a show of strength.

Again, this is stuff I've just found helps me and some people in my friend group that deal with similar issues.

Edit: I didn't suggest therapy because I wasn't sure how ""extreme"" you felt about your depression or if it was more similar to mine. However, therapy is one of the best options, and should never be seen as giving up on yourself as more as it is strengthening yourself for this crazy world. ",Positive,mental health,5,2019-03-18

Work out, it helps to reduce cortisol, even more so if you have never lifted regularly or aerobic activities.

&amp;#x200B;

You will have a midterm and a final that are done alone (on video) and uploaded for review. She gives a rubric, FOLLOW IT EXACTLY. The instructor is nice, but she will ding you if you don't follow the instructions exactly as it relates to length, dialogue, etc. There was a Facebook component, you would have to join the group, and submit 4 assignments (out of 6), usually commenting or finding a music video or video clip, and making observations about it.  It isn't an easy A, but an A is definitely possible if you are disciplined. For me, I need the structure of an in-person class to stay motivated in my learning. All of that said, I am older, slower, and less in tune with technology as the average GT undergrad, so you may find the online course to be a great experience.

I‚Äôm a huge advocate of therapy. Talking through your issues with a professional is so cathartic, and they can teach you great skills to help you improve your mental health (DBT therapy is my favorite). 

Staying connected with friends is important, even if it‚Äôs just over text or FaceTime. 

Celebrate the little things, even if it‚Äôs not where you wanna be in life. Yeah, it can feel sucky that one of my ‚Äòaccomplishments‚Äô of the day was sitting through class, but who gives a fuck? It was a big deal for me. 

Consider medication. If you‚Äôre to the point of having suicidal thoughts (me too my dude), medication may be a helpful addition to therapy. Studies prove that for the best results, you should combine therapy and medication. When I got on a good medication, it was like my world changed. It‚Äôs a bit of a roller coaster though, so be prepared!

Be honest. Don‚Äôt lie to yourself or others about your mental health. You don‚Äôt have to tell everyone everything, but you have to come to terms with wheee you are in life.

Honestly what's more important than school choice is getting them involved in extracurricular activities that relate to engineering. Whether it's robotics, car clubs, some sort of research/science fair project, etc, being able to write about that experience will help them a lot.

Academic scholarships are extremely hard (read practically impossible) to come by, but they can get Zel if they keep up their grades. As for athletics, if they're good enough at a sport to be recruited, that can be a massive boost to admissions, because admissions standards for athletes is much more lenient (and if you get a scholarship then yay money).

If they want to then fine, but if they want to do other things that have nothing to do with STEM then encourage them in those. What Tech is looking for is students who are curious and driven and love to learn new things - any new things - and who have the self-awareness to understand why they like certain activities and what they get out of them. It's not all about engineering or science; they could have interests in music or other creative pursuits, sports, scouts, a second language, a job or their own small business, or something STEM-related, but it has to be something the kid is interested and invested in and that they ENJOY. It is better to have a few activities that they love and will stick to throughout high school that will allow them to demonstrate how they developed their interests over time and took their passion to the next level, what they learned and the interesting experiences they had along the way, what was hard that they overcame. And hopefully they will become leaders and mentors, earn honors or win awards, or use their interests and involvement to give back in some way - this is what Tech wants to see.

There is no ""perfect"" combo, but every adjustment gets you a little closer to where you wanna be.

&amp;#x200B;

I was so depressed 2 years ago and my score just free falling. getting out of bed was so hard for me. I made myself study in CoB or CULC starbucks to surround myself with people and stop myself from having negative thoughts. I went to counseling weekly just to talked and tried to find solutions for my problems. I can't talk to my parents about that because they don't believe depression is a thing and their solution was just ""to surpress it and don't feel it at all"". The result: I bursted into tears in the middle of Spring Career fair, which I prepared 2 weeks before, and it was hard because I tried to focus on something to forget about my problem.  I remembered cried my eyes out in Spring break exactly 2 years ago, but honestly it got better after that.   


My advice: cry if you can, feel things you are supposed to feel. try to set up counseling session. talk to someone who believes you and support you. meditate. take a walk - used to walk from north ave, thru beltline to Ponce and soaked in the sunlight. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am thankful to have friends and counseling during my hardest time. Honestly those difficult times make me a much stronger, more resilient person. I hope that helps, and you need more support, pm me. ","Positive.

comment,"Hello, I shared some methods that I adopted in another post before and I would definitely love to share with y'all again: 

1, Working out for 30 mins everyday definitely helps, at least in my situation. Combining muscle training and running gives the optimal results. But please note that, it must be EVERYDAY. Working out 2-3 times a week does NOT do any help with depression since depression is a constant thing. \*\*\* I definitely recommend you to try this for a week. I think it truly works. 

2, Bullshitting with classmates or even on Reddit is a great way to unlash your emotion! Yes, it does help and we have a lot of cool guys on Reddit!

3, Keeping a cat will help! Well, at least my cat stopped me from committing suicide last year.

And you're not overestimating yourself.  You could do it if you needed to, it's just not worth it if you're just trying to get out faster.   It's really easy to forget that your time is yours and that you need to practice self care and self love daily (gt can be soul crushing at times).  Your schedule should account for that and make time to do things that give you joy outside of your work.

Make sure they join NHS in highschool, it is a really dumb club but everyone I have known in good schools was in it. Could be confirmation bias.

Have them do Boy Scouts, and more importantly follow through and have them get Eagle. There is an immediate bond between two Eagle scouts, regardless of how irrational it is, if the person reading your application is an Eagle Scout, or is the parent of an Eagle Scout, it's an instant +1000 points in your favor. I have had internships where every single intern is an Eagle Scout, and most of our interviewers were as well. It seriously makes a difference. Not to mention I learned a lot of public speaking and organizational skills there.

Besides that, somehow my parents made me care about my grades for my own good not just to appease them. They never checked my grades and instead just said ""Get into wherever you want, for whatever you want to do, and we will pay for it"". I feel like that is what made me happiest with my accomplishments and choices, but I really can't say how my parents got me to care enough. I guess just start from elementary school emphasizing to them how important grades are to their future, even that early on. My parents would not have been happy with anything but an A, even in 1st grade. And the story wasn't ""This grade is bad and I am mad at you"" it was ""This grade is bad, and here is how that will spiral into a shitty future if you don't fix it"".

Also don't fill their time with ECs. Let them choose 1 or 2 that THEY enjoy and pursue those. Quality&gt;&gt;&gt;quantity. In fact, my  sophomore-senior  years of highschool I was working 12-16 hours/week and not doing many ECs at all. I didn't need the money, in fact I just spent most of it on stupid shit. But I worked my ass of an got promoted a few times while there, and got plenty of great recommendation letters from my manager. All they want to see is that the kid is completely committed to something.

Quick edit after reading your post again: Be super careful about keeping them in Kumon for long. I worked there for 3 years in highschool, and saw so many kids come to HATE education and learning because of it. That isn't to say its bad for everyone, but it depends on the kid. Especially once they get to late middle school/early highschool, it is 100% unnecessary and is frankly absolutely soul sucking for the kids. They will learn plenty in AP classes in school.

Look at Elon University's dining Instagram (@elondining) or JMU (ranked #4 in campus dining). **Granted though Elon is one of Aramark's ""Harvest Table"" accounts, basically you're a super boujie that wants exquisite dining all year long**

Aramark can provide excellent food to students, it's really just how far the University administration will go for the students. SGA does play a big role too, dependent on how big SGA is. At my current account we work with SGA a lot to put on events and bring new things to students, I know other schools SGA don't do a lot, but it looks like here at Tech they're really trying to help you guys which is awesome! 

As for going self-op'd it's way harder then it sounds. Aramark and every other dining contractor already has training, marketing, food and supply vendors, HR, and the ability to pull people from accounts to support already in place. To convert to a self-op over a summer I imagine would be a complete nightmare and struggle this would ultimately hurt the students. Working for a dining contractor really opened my eyes to how COMPLEX campus dining is. ",Neutral,"dining, aramark, university, sga, training, marketing, hr, self-op.",1,2019-03-20

comment,"To be completely honest, it's not going to be easy for you to transfer to Tech. Your plan of going back to school for a year is exactly what you'll have to do, and if you're able to get a 4.0 for those semesters, you'll probably have a chance. The admissions office does consider academic improvements over time, so if you get a 4.0 when you go back, they'll give more leniency on the lower grades from before.

The fact that you had a two year gap in classes will actually be to your benefit if you perform better when you go back. Make sure to write about how you've changed in that time, and your commitment to improving yourself.",Neutral,"academic transfer, admissions office",23,2019-03-20

comment,"Hello I took ECE 2035 last semester and am in CS 2200 right now.

I was worried about the jump as well, even considered taking CS 2110.. but I am glad I did not.

The first half of the semester we were working in a program called Circuit Sim for our projects. I had never heard of it, I am not sure if CS students used it before. I believe it is a clone of Logism.
I did not have trouble picking it up.

Everything in this half was very fine. It is implementing things you learned in ECE 2020 with some mild assembly language thrown in.

For example, you don't need to remember how to build a component at a low level. Just know things like the timing of a register and a clock signal, or that an adder... adds.
Then as part of the class you are taught how to put these components together to build a datapath. Continuing on further a bit and you add interrupt and I/O support. Then you learn how to pipeline the processor. This can be hard stuff at times, but not from lack of per-requisite knowledge.

These were all new topics for everyone in the class. Just look back at some of the big ideas from ECE 2020 and how assembly language worked in ECE 2035 and you will be fine.

Now we are working on Memory and Memory Management.
We just started using C.
Once again the material is new for everyone, and the C is not too bad. 
The project I am working on now is done totally in C. They give out some material as a refresher beforehand that covers everything you needed to know for the project concerning C. Also the files they give us for the project to expand have plenty of commentary.

**In summary**: Logism/Circuit Sim is easy to pick up. The assembly is all been seen before. The C has mostly been seen. An ECE 2020 level of circuit knowledge is deeper than what you will actually need (but what you will build, its timing and it logic will be complicated).

Most of the difficulty for me has been in the new concepts.

Being in the school of Civil and Environmental Engineering, myself and classmates mostly went to engineering consulting firms. Classmates from the masters program were more likely to stay in academia later with BS/MS non-thesis folks like myself being less likely to do so.

Cheer up. You learn a lot at Tech, but there's no way you'll be totally loaded with skills at graduation (part of why you can't get PE until after a few years). You learn a lot on the job.  
Tech is hard and if you make it out, you'll likely know enough theory to give you good engineering/science/logic instinct, know how to find additional information on a topic and most of all, have experience with time management of difficult tasks.

You will presumably start as a project engineer or project manager or something equivalent, and even as you learn more, move up and have experience under your belt... at some point the only way to move up in such an environment is to go into middle management.

&amp;#x200B;

There are other ways, you can start your own business, change fields, go into the research end... but one big part of your professional life should be figuring out where you want to end up in the near to middle future so that you can work towards that goal.   Switching fields is not like switching majors.. if you haven't networked your way into a change of fields then it becomes increasingly difficult to get call backs for job submissions that aren't directly in line with your experience or education listed on your resume.

As for where people go... it runs the gamut.  Smart money is to take a job with a stable company that pays you well and gives the opportunity to travel a little bit a newish hire.

Those are pretty high titles. The companies I've been with would have a typical progression of Associate Engineer, Engineer, Engineer II, Senior Engineer, Senior Engineer II, and then Associate Manager or Principle Engineer depending which pathway you take - individual contributor or people manager.

Depending on your experience, you might come in at Associate Engineer if you're fresh out of college, or as an Engineer if you're had considerable internship or coop experience. 

I'm in regulatory affairs these days, and our progression is Associate, Specialist, Senior Specialist, Principle Specialist or, if people management, Senior Specialist to Associate Manager, Manager, Senior Manager, Associate Director, Director.

IE was a good fit considering my history, but I wanted to do more ME work that I felt I‚Äôd missed out on due to my lack of confidence and later my sudden shift to leadership. I couldn‚Äôt let my technical inexperience continue to hurt my confidence and hold me back from actually *getting* technical experience. (Sidenote: besides technical coursework, getting involved with RoboJackets, any of the car racing teams, or the Invention Studio or the Hive (makerspaces) are great if you want extra experience. ME 2110 also is a great help in that regard.)

The first year of ME is a lot of general classes, with ME 1770 (which teaches sketching and SolidWorks) being the main major-specific one. ME‚Äôs and engineering majors in general also take math (calculus, linear algebra, etc.), physics 1 (which it seems you‚Äôd have credit for), and English. 

Idk how it goes for ChemE; you‚Äôd have to compare the curriculum. In later years, I know ChemE is very sequential, with people constantly ending up in the same classes in a litany of prerequisites. They also require a different chemistry class (CHEM 1211 and 1212 for ChemE‚Äôs, but CHEM 1310 for everyone else. Idk if ME accepts 1211.)","Positive

In case you do need MATLAB for ECE 2026, you can easily teach yourself the basics with this free guide: (I can't post any outside links here so it's the first pdf link that appears when you google ""CS 1371 guide""). I doubt that we'll need anything beyond loops and conditionals.

The guide I mentioned above saved my grade when I took 1371 during transient study program at tech. In fact, I didn't need to go to class at all.

From what I gathered, ECE 2040 sounds like a relatively easy class compared to most other 2000 level courses. ECE 2020 is supposed to be even easier so I think it's okay to take the three over summer. ECE 2026 appears to have the same schedule as regular semester except increased lecture times. I also read somewhere that you can do the lab stuff for 2026 beforehand and turn it in when you arrive &amp; leave.

If someone can take this + english + diff eq over regular semester then it's probably doable with some efforts. It definitely didn't feel excessive when I took CS 1371 + ChBE 2100 over summer so there should be some more space for a third course (ChBE 2100 is an intense weed-out course for ChemE).

Let's say you get an internship in IT and you hate it, then you know to focus on thr dev side of CS from that point onward. But if it turns out you love IT and the idea of being a system admin, that could change your degree path dramatically.

comment,"Me neither, so I looked it up on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttlecock).

&gt;Feather or synthetic shuttlecocks

&gt;The feathers are brittle; shuttlecocks break easily and often need to be replaced several times during a game. For this reason, synthetic shuttlecocks have been developed that replace the feathers with a plastic skirt. Players often refer to synthetic shuttlecocks as plastics and feathered shuttlecocks as feathers.

&gt;Feather shuttles need to be properly humidified for at least 4 hours prior to play in order to fly the correct distance at the proper speed and to last longer. Properly humidified feathers flex during play, enhancing the shuttle's speed change and durability. Dry feathers are brittle and break easily, causing the shuttle to wobble. Saturated feathers are 'mushy', making the feather cone narrow too much when strongly hit, which causes the shuttle to fly overly far and fast. Humidification boxes are often used, but a simple moist sponge inserted in the feather end of the closed shuttle tube will work nicely. Water should never touch the cork of the shuttle. Shuttles are tested prior to play to make sure they fly true and at the proper speed, and cover the proper distance. Different weights of shuttles are used to compensate for local atmospheric conditions. Both humidity and height above sea level affect shuttle flight. World Badminton Federation Rules say the shuttle should reach the far doubles service line plus or minus half the width of the tram. According to manufacturers (!) proper shuttle will generally travel from the back line of the court to just short of the long doubles service line on the opposite side of the net, with a full underhand hit from an average player.[5]

It looks like only feather shuttlecocks need to be moistened (?) and synthetic ones don't need to be moistened. However, people tend to prefer the feather ones for competitive play:

&gt;Most experienced and skillful players greatly prefer feathers, and serious tournaments or leagues are always played using feather shuttlecocks of the highest quality.[6] Experienced players generally prefer the ""feel"" of feathered shuttlecocks[citation needed] and assert that they are able to control the flight of feathers better than that of plastics. In Asia, where feather shuttlecocks are more affordable than in Europe and North America, plastic shuttlecocks are hardly used at all.[citation needed]",Neutral,shuttlecocks,5,2019-03-22

Twitter is great for networking and learning; follow other engineers at companies you admire. If you go down the rabbit hole you‚Äôll get to meet a lot of brilliant people. I‚Äôve done this myself and it has helped me more than I had imagined.  If I ever needed a job, I could post a tweet on Twitter and get offers - at worst, I could DM a couple of people that follow me or that I follow and build a relationship to get my foot in the door.

Reddit is great for networking also. There are some cool projects on here and a lot of inspiration and experience.

GitHub is a great way to contribute to projects and network (if done right). If you‚Äôre out of ideas on what to build (there‚Äôs an endless amount on the Internet), check out other people‚Äôs projects and contribute (e.g. fix bugs, help build new features, etc).

‚ÄúStudents who come to Georgia Tech from another state and work for companies in Georgia remain ineligible for in-state tuition in the absence of **compelling evidence of intent to remain in Georgia permanently**. Having Georgia voter registration, having employment in any position normally filled by a student (such as co-op, graduate research assistant, or graduate teaching assistant), having a lease of living quarters, having a Georgia automobile registration, and having Georgia driver's license **do not constitute sufficient evidence of domicile** to affect classification as an in-state student under the Board of Regents' policy.‚Äù

They said he was out of state based on where he grew up and went to school and did not meet the ""compelling evidence"" standard.

If you think transferring would make you happier (and isn't fiscally reckless), I'd go for it. 

But I would say that it is possible to make friends here, and it is easier during your first year in places like the dining hall and dorms because your fellow first years are looking to make friends too. (sorry-- i'm assuming you're a 1st year)

comment,"Hi, LMC major who switched from engineering, I'm in my second to last semester at Tech.

Quick thoughts:

- With regard to the ""harder to find a job and pay off student loans"", I think it can look like that just because engineering has a really straightforward career path and pipeline, but LMC is a really flexible degree and there's demand in some fields for it more than others. It definitely depends on how you market yourself *and* marry that degree with other skillsets (I have a strong background in data science and analytics, for example, and most of my professional work has married analytics and my LMC background), and I think that's the main appeal of the LMC degree, that it goes well with other skillsets. You can see [the different kinds of jobs LMC alums have received at the LMC website](https://lmcdegree.lmc.gatech.edu/). What career are you going for with your major change?

- With regards to my personal experience in finding a job, I haven't been actively searching for a job but I have had a lot of success in finding internships (which I hope would correlate well to career searching!). I don't know anyone else within the program who has had significant difficulties finding internships or jobs with the degree but I also don't know a lot of LMC graduates, so take my personal experience in this regard with a grain of salt.

- The LMC program can be, in my opinion, a mixed bag, and it can depend on the classes. Some of them I've found extremely interesting, engaging, and insightful with real professional applications. Some of the others can feel like fluff classes at times, where you might be learning something cool but it's something you'll never need (though to be fair, engineering felt like that to me at times as well). The LMC department, however, is superb - the advisor is great, most of the teachers are friendly, etc. 

- And I know all about the ""my parents don't want me to become a liberal arts major"" - I was in that same boat. I had studied aerospace engineering as a side-hobby in high school, went to GT specifically for aerospace engineering, I took aerospace engineering classes for two years, and I realized that it wasn't for me. Unfortunately, when I tried convincing my parents that they should let me switch, they didn't approve. I ended up simply switching myself over and letting my parents know that this was what I was doing, and then they finally hopped on board once I took control of my own education.

If you have any other questions about LMC, feel free to DM me and I'm happy to get you answers (or find someone who can answer those for you).",Positive,"lmc, engineering, career, degree, skillsets, analytics, internships, program, classes, department, parents.",11,2019-03-23

My GPA wasn‚Äôt on my resume or on my website. The only place my GPA existed was Buzzport. I walked into career fair with my head high and with a polished resume. And I got a couple of interviews. Not even once did a recruiter ask for my GPA. Yes, there are some who care, but many don‚Äôt. You being a Tech student speaks for itself.

Also, I think you mentioned you don‚Äôt have any career experience in your field. So what? Get involved with clubs on campus and show these clubs how you can use your skills to make a difference. And then, put these clubs down on your resume. It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt have an officer position, as long as you can show you used your skills.

comment,"Hey! I'm a second year CM major with Media and Interaction Design threads, so even though it's not exactly the same I feel like I can answer your questions. Feel free to PM me with more questions or anything, I absolutely love my major and talking about it! Also this is long I'm so sorry.

1. The workload isn't bad. Most, if not all, of the LMC classes you'll be taking are project-based. It's nice because you don't have to worry about lots of exams and finals and there aren't a lot of small homework assignments in between projects, but it definitely requires some decent time management so things don't get too out of control for you with several projects piling up. I've noticed that it's definitely a lighter load compared to some of the other computer-related majors like CS or CompE. Switching after your first semester isn't going to put you behind at all because some/most of the classes you'll take during that semester apply to all majors.
2. I'm definitely a weird exception here so you might want to ask more CM majors regarding the amount of time spent here. I'm set to graduate next spring (swear to god i have no idea how) having done internships in the summer and not participating in a co-op. With that being said though, as an OOS student I can totally sympathize with that quantity of tuition. I don't think four years should be too much of an issue...but like I said, I'm not the person to ask for this one.
3. There are two study aboard opportunities currently catering specifically to CM students - Copenhagen in the fall and Malmo, Sweden in the spring. I haven't done either of them but I hear that they're awesome. You can also do a lot of the CS study abroad opportunities, like Barcelona in the summer, because some of the coursework crosses over.
4. As a Media/Interaction Design student, I'm interested in data vis and UI/UX too! I've had no problem with getting any of the same internship opportunities that CS people get (ie interviews with Amazon, Microsoft, if that's what you're looking for). You can also look for more UI/UX related positions, there are lots of those as well. The CoC Career Fair is good at catering to both majors.
5. Because CM is a mix of CS and LMC, there is \~some\~ coding required. You take Data Structures and some important fundamental coding classes, but for most of my upper-level LMC classes there isn't much coding experience needed. I found my first three semesters were more coding-oriented but now as I'm taking more LMC classes it's slowing down a lot and getting more into design.

About GPA. I heard a lot of people said that if your GPA is low, simply don't put it on resume, like you said. But some other people, especially people from ECE department said the opposite, like if you don't put it on they will know your GPA are not great, so no matter how bad it is you have to put it on.. so I'm not sure which one should I follow.

comment,"As long as you're not a robot, you shouldn't have any issues dating here. Echoing what others have said, if you find it difficult to meet girls normally, consider joining a fraternity. Between mixers and the typical week to week parties, you'll meet plenty of new people. If I were you, I'd stay away from Tinder though. Maybe I was just bad at online dating, but I found that the only thing it did was make things awkward around campus. Once you match with someone and things don't work out, it seems like you start running into them all over the place.

Also, try talking to the girls in your residence hall before classes start. Everyone is trying to make friends in the first few weeks, and people are typically pretty open-minded in terms of going to events and such with new people. Don't underestimate the power of platonic female friends either. Chances are, they might have a few single female friends they want to set you up with.

comment,"In my experience and the experience of my friends, most employers never ask for the GPA from a student of the Institute. You are capable. I started as a transfer from an unranked school. This school kicked my ass the first semester. In total, I was in school 5.5 years. I graduated. I am employed. Here are my tips:

* Limit yourself to 12 credit hours per semester. 
* If you have anymore ""soft"" requirements (e.g., philosophy, ethics, psychology), spread those out over your remaining semesters in order to stay full time (12 hours), but not overwhelm yourself and focus on STEM classes.
* Find internships at startup companies. You might have to make a jump to software - which you can do with a Computer Engineering major. You won't be at Intel, but you will be earning money and experience in a related technical field. 
* With software experience, after graduation, you could always make your way back into the Computer Engineering field by coding firmware.
* If you must absolutely graduate by Spring 2020, then it is better to have a degree than not. Your degree is more important than anything. Bachelor's Degrees are non-negotiable requirements for most STEM jobs. This is the most important bullet point of all.

comment,"So I took Physics 1 last summer via SOUP and basically it's a take home lab. You just take a video of yourself doing something related to physics, be it dropping a ball, rolling an object, etc. Then we used a tracking software to get data from the video such as velocity, position, acceleration and all that good jazz. And the lab report was a YouTube video we would make explaining how what we did relates to what is being taught in the class and there would be a couple of hypothetical questions we would have to answer in our videos. We also used Vpython to graph data taken from the tracking software. We also used it to simulate the same lab but with better conditions. For example, when dropping a ball, you would expect the only force acting on it to be gravity, but the air from the AC could be exerting forces on it as well as air resistance. Simulating an object falling in Vpython gets rid of those extra anomalies. Great thing is, your lab reports are peer graded, and everyone pretty much knows to take it easy on everybody. I think your lab will be peer graded by 3 other students  and your overall grade will be the average of those 3 grades.

comment,"It is quite natural to develop research interests in adjacent fields /diverse fields. In fact, most interesting new research usually happens at the intersection of different fields. 

A few suggestions from my experience over 3 years as a grad student.  Before telling your mentor/advisor that you are disinterested in the current project, see if there is any potential overlap between your current project &amp; new research direction. Talk to them about expanding the research in the direction you are interested in and be proactive in making a presentation/writing a one-page proposal etc. (laying out the research problem, why it is important, prior work in this area, and your potential contribution.).

If you strongly feel about this direction and do not see your current colleagues being receptive, try to informally talk to the folks in the new lab you are looking at - to make sure they are hiring, have funding, and are good people to work with. 

Lastly, one thing to keep in mind is that research interests evolve over time (both yours and your advisors), but advising-styles and work-ethic are more rigid.

Previous course websites will give you a good idea of the concepts these classes teach.  I would take the classes that have concepts that you enjoyed learning about in the past. All of the information in these classes can be found online and in books, but they may not cover the depth you're looking for.

comment,"Hey!

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the late reply, but better late than never?!

&amp;#x200B;

Atlanta did not really ""decriminalize"" Marijuana.   It‚Äôs important to note that this change for Atlanta doesn‚Äôt make it legal to possess or use marijuana.  The ""decriminalization"" of weed just means that possession of the drug no longer leads to jail time if issued through the city ordinance violation. Without full legalization, weed is still an illicit substance that‚Äôs you can‚Äôt buy, grow, or sell.

&amp;#x200B;

As State Police Officers (GTPD, GSU, Capitol Police, GSP etc) we can enforce both the Atlanta city ordinance and /or state law.   We don't issue the fine, that's determined by the judge.  The ""decriminalization"" your'e referring to just gave us an option.   I arrested someone for Marijuana possession last week and they went to the city jail through the city ordinance, they also had a warrant for their arrest.  But last August (I was on patrol for a month) I arrested multiple people for Marijuana on the state charge. There are also Officer's and instances where we would just simply issue a citation under the city ordinance for marijuana possession. This gives the Officer discretion and more options.

&amp;#x200B;

To me, it makes enforcement easier.  Whether it lets us focus on more serious crimes, from my experience, no.   I've seen both minor and serious crime involving Marijuana.

&amp;#x200B;

Your second question.. Because of the awesome men and women of the Georgia Tech and Atlanta Police Department's!

comment,"I've been HTA for CS 3510/3511 for a couple of semesters, and everytime I've TAed for the course the professor has used the same textbook (Algorithms by S. Dasgupta, C. H. Papadimitriou, and U. V. Vazirani.) though sometimes they cover the material in a different order, and not everything within the textbook is covered. Generally, the material covered in the course is a subset of the material covered in the grad version of the course. All professors cover topics such as divide and conquer, some number theory, graph theory (DFS, shortest paths, MSTs, etc.) and NP completeness. The other stuff, such as Huffman encoding, max flow, FFT and linear programming varies based on which professor is teaching the course.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I don't find reading ahead in the textbook before I take a course very helpful, though your mileage may vary. Professor Vigoda is pretty approachable, and I've heard very good things about Professor Brito as well. Some people are scared of the course because it's more math-y than they might be used to, and it's difficult to memorize your way around the material without putting in time to understand it. Going to office hours and doing practice problems definitely helps. I don't think it's as difficult as people believe it is, but I'm biased and I don't know you, so I'd recommend speaking with the Professors or your adviser if you're worried about the workload.",Neutral,"textbook, course material, professors, office hours, advising.",1,2019-03-25

You likely won't have to do any coding, but the idea is that you would be able to code any of the algorithms you see or design if you had to. In lower level classes like 1332 you were given algorithms and had to implement them, so it's assumed that you're already comfortable with implementation and the focus is on design and understanding. You'll be describing or writing pseudocode for algorithms, but actually coding up something you don't understand can sometimes be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

The person in question on the other end of these private messages had been in talks with me about running, and I had originally reached out to them about it because they were very involved in SGA and Greek life. But I and others discussed the situation and came to the conclusion that while this person was a prominent face in SGA, they weren‚Äôt really in line with our politics and that the Greek community would be less receptive to our vision and platform than other areas of campus. We resolved that we were going to focus on reaching out to students that typically don‚Äôt participate in SGA. This is very clearly an attack from another campaign (in fact, the person at the other end of these messages is directly involved with another campaign) and has probably been selectively edited for their best interests. We will never engage in that sort of behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

I did not ask John to be our Vice-Presidential candidate because of his race. Anyone who knows John or I personally knows that we have worked together in SGA to increase access to funding to under-served, minority organizations. Several black student leaders who I have worked with on this issue over the years recommended to me that John would be the right person for the job. Additionally, John and I were on the same page with a lot of the big platform points we are currently running on (Public Dining, Saving UTC, Mental Health) in a way that this other person was not. Ultimately we decided that John would be a better fit because he was more aligned with my vision for campus and because he was embedded in a community that we thought really needed to be heard on campus. It‚Äôs a simple fact that Greek life is massively overrepresented in SGA at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

In that AMA, I lamented that many SGA campaigns often appoint people to positions as political favors rather than look for people trying to actually make change on campus. It is an unfortunate reality. I will explicitly reiterate that we are not engaging in this at all. We have not promised anybody any cabinet positions in exchange for support.

So why'd you even select them in the first place? Seems like due diligence on a ticket would've been good. And then just saying ""my bad, we're going with somebody else. But here! You can still have a spot on my campaign!"" isn't a great look.

She doesn't say much specific about outright fraudulent data being made up, and claims she's leaving because of the culture in the climate field and the politicization of the academic establishment. I took several EAS and climate change classes, we actually talked specifically about her resigning (and other controversies in the climate science community) in my climate change class. 

It's less about data being made up, more about climate scientists being pushed in very specific directions, being told what they should/shouldn't research, etc - that's where the politicization comes in. The whole idea of ""fraudulent data"" likely comes from the public misunderstanding the methods climate scientists use to manipulate/clean up the sheer amount of data that is collected. Some scientists use very reductive methods to prove their point, others are more transparent about their methods - the more recent IPCC reports actually discuss these methods and controversies. BUT that's not really what she's talking about here and doesn't really make much mention of those controversies in the article.

I agree that the panic of the world in 12 years is kind of silly, but Judith Curry left her position for more complex reasons than just ""fraudulent data being pushed"". Your comment is at best misleading, at worst deliberately dishonest.

BMED3310 is a standard lecture course with homeworks and exams, but is quite difficult for those not good at math. I didn't have any trouble with the class, but it's often cited as the hardest because of the great depth of mathematical concepts that you need to understand and apply on exams.

ECE3710 is easy - it's essentially all flipped, so just get ahead whenever you can and you won't really have an issue.

Now, I will echo what was said earlier about admissions. Every year more people apply, and therefore the admission rate is decreasing. I won't be Undergrad Admissions and directly tell you whether you'd get in, but it seems like you're doing the right things.

There was an article in the AJC a while back by Rick Clark about admissions myth busting, and the gist was that Tech likes folks who are good at being themselves. My advice is to keep building on your rocketry interests. Keep at it with the research and competitions, possibly lead your team, and take related APs that interest you.

The Econ program offers a great degree of flexibility in what classes you choose; there's the standard econ classes all take and enough free electives to add minor or a focus in something else  Your job prospects are what you make of them. There are lots of positions out there for which Econ graduates are well-suited for. In addition to the standard Econ courses, I took some CS/data analytics and finance courses. I had a finance internship at Delta Air Lines and two airline (data analysis) internships at Delta and Southwest. I tell people employers are more interested in the skills you bring than what your actual major is; choose classes so you learn skills for the industry/job you want to be in. If you're interested in the economy or how people make choices and allocate resources, it's truly an interesting program.

3630 as a whole is also pretty chill, with a quiz about once every two to three weeks that you can ace by reading back through the slides.

comment,"Had Yoda for fluids in Fall 2018. Got an A. I don't know if it's her or the subject, but the class was **hard**. Her homeworks are very difficult and require a lot of time, so going to the homework help sessions by the TA is a must. All of her quizzes were difficult to prepare for.  It's called a quiz, but I assure you, it's an exam with half the time. Doing well in the homeworks and past quizzes did not mean getting a good score on the actual quiz. Because there was so little time given for quizzes, we literally had to read the question twice and know the answer instantly to get a good score or get lucky with an approach. To put it simply, you have to know the answer and then prove you know it *quickly* rather than working through the problem to the answer. Therefore, if your initial ""guess"" is wrong, you're toast.

Her final exam is optional, but if taken will replace the lowest two quiz grades no matter what. *Even if it brings your grade down*. Grades aren't guaranteed until after all the final exams have been graded because people are given grades based on their raw score relative to others. So anxiety about final exams is a thing. Before the final exam you might have a B. After the final exam, someone else might've done really well and now you have a C.

Don't get me wrong. Yoda's a great lecturer and I learned a lot, but it didn't have to be so stressful. This class was more about being a good test taker than being knowledgeable on fluids.

comment,"I do want to say that even though it's just a student position, a good SGA president can do a lot to help students, and that's something worth being serious about. The president this year advocated for Tech students at the Georgia State Capitol and with US congressmen, and the cabinet members who get picked can lead initiatives that help students be overall more satisfied with their experience here. Downplaying the importance of these elections only discourages people from running and tells the student body that it's pointless to reach out to SGA and voice your thoughts. Most of the people I've met this year are just passionate about issues at Tech, whether it's sustainability or academic opportunities, and they start by trying to make a difference there. When you get to the Pres/EVP positions, they're forced to become much more political to attract voters who, in the end, care a lot about a wide variety of issues. Sure, there's obviously ambition that goes into preparing a presidential campaign, but I think all these candidates see it as their chance to change the relationship between SGA and the student body and a way to prepare themselves for bigger things. So be critical of their ideas, question them, voice your concerns, but students who are this passionate about coming up with ways to improve our school don't deserve to be mocked for the efforts they put in.

Note: I agree that this effort in strategy is going too far. I myself think a student election should be about personally reaching to as many students as possible and convincing individuals to vote for what they believe in instead of thinking they'll just follow their community.

comment,"Gahh you're too young to be worrying about this. Enjoy high school while you still can. Part of college admissions is the essay. You can only write a good essay if you have good life experiences to draw from.

But. It's hard for any of us to really say. Every year the bar gets higher and higher, and it's hard to tell how much higher it'll get every year. It's relative to your peers across the entire country (and to some extent, world).  

It might help to specialize in a certain topic/field (like... do more CS stuff, or more math stuff) depending on what major you're interested in. Tech likes students who are a ""T"". Lots of general knowledge, but very deep knowledge in one specific field. Also maybe doubling down on a club. Like, Rocketry Club. Try seeing how far you can take that club (national competitions, school attention/funding, corporate sponsors, etc.). But only if it's what you're passionate about. If you still don't know, that's more than okay, you're supposed to be starting to figure that out.  

But seriously. 2nd year in high school and worrying about college... I was busy worrying about chocolate milk vs. nonfat milk for lunch.  

&amp;#x200B;

Life advice: Enjoy high school, it's a set of experiences that you can't get any other time in your life. These potentially missed experiences will have a measurable impact on your life.   

Admissions advice: Maybe take AP Calc BC instead of AB. Spend this year really trying to find something you're passionate about (just do a bunch of things. If you find something fun, do more of it) (it's really okay if you don't find your passion. many of my friends are still figuring that out.). Quality &gt; Quantity. Do something that makes a measurable impact on your local community.  

&amp;#x200B;

Please take my advice with a grain of salt. My only qualification is I got in. Nothing more, and probably a bit less :p.

One of them was an awesome dude who was fun to hang out with, the other was a literal drug dealer (it's very fun waking up at 3 AM during finals week to the sound of the cops dragging away a dealer who had a bit too much of his product in your freshman dorm). This is obviously a *very extreme case* and I think the odds of you getting someone that awful as a roomie are slim to none, but still - why take the chance?

I met my roommate through a GT 2020 facebook page where people posted their interests, sleeping habits, etc. and it turned out pretty well. If there's something like that out there for C/o 2023, I'd look around for that, but if you have a childhood friend who you know well enough and get along with well, I might do that - your freshman roommate doesn't have to be your best friend in the world, just someone you know you can tolerate.",Negative,"roommate, facebook page, freshman year",13,2019-03-26

For what it's worth, I was offered work/study in the spring to help offset some of these costs. Students with FWS are given priority in on-campus job searching, and most of these jobs pay well and are very flexible with your class schedule. As someone else already said, there are also major-specific scholarships that open up to you once you're here. Also, if you're into this sort of thing, there are ways to reduce costs later on in your college career; for example, being a PL/RA gets you free housing + a small stipend.

comment,"Real generally, like at a lot of places at, Ga Tech the Econ major is part of Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, not the Scheller College of Business which has some implications.

Pros: 
-Econ is a lays a great quantitative/qualitative theoretical background that prepares you for a variety of things, and you're at least modestly hirable in many of the entry-level roles available to business majors, and for basically all roles available to liberal arts majors
-Econ looks great on grad school apps, even if you're not continuing in pure econ

Cons:
-Econ can be fairly theoretical and not everything readily translates into concrete skills like a ""business"" major
-kind of like majoring in psychology or geology, you can't really call yourself an ""economist"" with an undergrad major alone

Basic jobs available to econ majors might be entry business analyst roles, entry consulting team roles, project management etc.  But econ is a very broad brush to paint with, and with the right internship(s) and mix of electives you might make it into almost whatever you want.  I'd also highly recommend you take a few business electives like intro to Accounting/Finance at a minimum, helps bridge the gap to speaking the same language as the people who are focused more on application than theory.

comment,"im in a quad rn as a freshman, i met one of the girls through facebook roommate search and the other two girls were random. we are also all out of state with only a handful at most of fellow students from our high schools going to gt at all, if that helps contextualize anything. we're also all different majors (all engineering though), and have somewhat different interests and personalities, though we're all relatively introvertive

personally, i feel like a quad would either be extremely beneficial or absolutely terrible depending on who you get for roommates. i absolutely love the girls im with and wouldnt trade them for anyone else-- but we got lucky. 

quads give a ton more room (if they dont have the dividing wall, but as far as i know not many have that wall), and it really doesnt feel like youre living with any more people.

in our experience, quad rooms get more traffic from other girls coming to visit since we have the space to accomodate. however, its still pretty easy to get 'alone time' even with others in the room (unless u find it hard to focus with others around).

if you do decide to go random; try meeting them at faset/talking online! even small talk helps the initial awkwardness. i was the last one to move in by a few days (the other three did gt programs the week before school), so believe me when i tell you talking online helped me feel less uncomfortable moving in last

One of the Sustainability Committee members will be at the table recording participation so that we can ensure that progress is being accurately tracked. There are also points for sharing your progress on social media to inspire others to try taking the steps you're taking during the challenge. This approach has worked well over the years we've done it and has helped keep people engaged with the challenge! -Vivek",Positive,"sustainability, waste reduction, education, participation, social media, engagement.",2,2019-03-27
comment,"I agree with the other responses here so far, and this is just a bit more context. I'm more than a decade removed from my econ degree, and I did graduate in December 2008, so your experience will probably be very different than mine, but there are still some commonalities. I'll note that economics is not easy. None of Tech's majors are easy, to be sure, but just because it's in the Ivan Allen College doesn't mean it's your average liberal arts degree (with full deference that LMC majors still take calculus).

Economics is highly analytical, and even within that vein Tech's undergrad econ program is more highly quantitative than most undergrad programs. Expect a lot of calculus and statistics, even some linear algebra. Especially in today's age of digital analytics economics can help bridge the gap between being a data guru and understanding business. That's a highly valuable skill.

I concur that you should augment your degree with some hard business skills. I got a finance certificate and also took some accounting courses. Depending on your career goals, marketing and operations also have strong ties to economics. You might also consider some CS courses or take advantage of some of the free programming courses the Library and Lynda have to offer, especially R and Python.

Finally, Willie Belton and Usha Nair-Reichert are awesome.

ETA: I'm less than a year from completing my MBA, and I'm really thankful I did economics.

I've been looking into it since then, and really haven't gotten anywhere on trying to figure out where the issues stems from. My workout right now is disabling IPv6 in the kernel and using 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 as my DNS (and I believe the DNS fix is what actually made the difference, edit: no, it's definitely disabling ipv6 that made the difference). I just submitted this and more details through the form you linked. However, the LAWN debug report page doesn't work for me.

Edit: it affects my laptop, desktop, and phone across GTwifi and Ethernet on windows and Linux on 3 different browsers (and yes, I cleared my cache). Appears to affect anything that resolves to a Google IP address, including fonts.google.com, apis.google.com, gstatic.com, blogger.com, etc etc etc, which has farily vast implications for browsing the internet.

GTother is not impacted as far as I can tell.

Edit 2: For anyone that sees this and needs a fix now, disable IPv6 (use this at your own risk!).

The state is not be confused with the so-called university, ""georgia"", and the capitalization of the first letter distinguishes the two.

3. If anyone ever asks you, ""What's the good word?"" your immediate reply is, ""To hell with georgia!"" or ""THWg!"". If anyone ever asks you, ""How 'bout them dawgs?"" the correct response is to say, ""Piss on 'em!""

comment,"Fun fact, we have to pay a yearly parking fee for our campus fleet vehicles as well. We also have to fight for service vehicle parking spaces with other service vehicles, campus contractors with business permits, as well as campus employees with business permits. There are most certainly less service vehicle spots than service vehicles. We have five vehicles that live near the Rich building, we have service vehicle spots for three of them and we hide the other two near the chiller plant. We're about to lose that space soon so not sure where those vehicles will end up. Those service vehicle spots are not ours, if a contractor parks in them we have to find another spot. Occasionally parking will take one away and we have to fight to get it back. 

Take a look in the bottom left of a service vehicle windscreen and you will find its campus parking permit. Service vehicles are allowed to park in any zone. Our vehicles do occasionally get tickets if someone parks them in a no-parking or loading zone. We occasionally get a ticket for parking a van in the loading area behind the Rich building when there are no service vehicle spots, even though it's our own loading area. 

I can't speak to the parking situation on west campus nor housing's fleet (or any parking situation really) but just wanted to note that campus departments that have service vehicles are customers of parking as well, do pay a fee to park, and finding available space is a problem. ","Neutral

comment,"I picked Tech over Cornell, Michigan, Purdue, RPI, WPI, and local in-state schools (I'm from New Jersey).

I was unsure of what kind of engineering program I wanted to pursue (mainly looking at AE, EE, CompE, and ChemE), so I researched a lot of rankings and found that Tech, UM, Purdue, and Cornell were all close enough that it wouldn't make a difference academics-wise, so everything else came down to the community and what the schools offered outside of classes. 

Of the schools mentioned above, Tech seemed to have the best community of students: people who were able to both study hard and have fun. I also really enjoyed the spirit of innovation here that didn't seem to exist as much at other schools. I really wanted to join a college marching band that wasn't super competitive. I also loved the warmer weather (not having to put on three coats to get to class is something I will never miss), and the great religious communities that exist here (I'm Catholic, and the Catholic Center here is surprisingly really great)

Finally, it came down to price. Georgia Tech is one of the cheapest OOS schools, especially when it comes to engineering. It was $5k/semester cheaper than Purdue and $10k/semester cheaper than Cornell (maybe more, it's been a while). 

I think there will never be a college that loves up to every one of your expectations. Georgia Tech does have its fair share of problems that your tour guides won't tell you, just like at every other university, and, like all students here, I like to complain about things. However, at the end of the day I couldn't imagine myself anywhere else. I absolutely love being here and I'm a little sad I don't have much time left.

comment,"I am a first-gen college student, so I had no clue about college before my first day of classes, so tbh I chose Tech because of its rankings, and I am in-state so Zell is great so that I don't have to take out any loans.  I think Tech is the best public school in Georgia so if you have Zell, you are getting your scholarship's worth here for sure.

I say it depends on if you are in/out of state and your intended field of study. I say in general, Tech is a great school for its location and ""prestige"" in employers eye's. It will get your foot in the door at a lot of places just because you are a student here. I say engineering/CS or business are typically all top-tier here, the industrial design department is great as well, and I think the humanities (LMC) department is lacking some options that other schools have. I am not too knowledgeable about other majors.

Positives:

I think there is generally a good community at Tech, and there is a group of people for everyone. I have been a part in a tiny 6 person ""nerdy"" CS club, an \~100 member Greek organization, a living learning community, and fluctuating member service organizations, and my friend group is as diverse as can be. Applying for jobs/getting interviews at big companies is very easy here, our student job board is pretty good for STEM majors (I am not sure about others) and I have gotten special marked applications/introduction emails to employers just because I reached out to older students or my advisor. I am Hispanic, and I feel like we have a great community on campus (my black friends do too) that keep me immersed in my culture. GT also has an amazing coop program, a lot of research opportunities, LLCs (check them out, great way to make your best-friends your first year) and many study abroad opportunities to choose from.

&amp;#x200B;

Negatives:

I am finishing my sixth semester here and I knew it was gonna be hard, so I always have to be staying on top of my classes to keep my scholarships. I think a 3.0 is very possible (minimum for most job opportunities) if you go to class, take notes, and study more than one day before your test. A 3.3, which you need for Zell, is harder, but also possible if you keep yourself focused and have the discipline to study 2-3 days a week and get started on your assignments as soon as you get them. Not gonna lie, a 3.5 or above is pretty hard to keep, but it is possible if you take advantage of campus resources, go to office hours (which have gotten me so many extra points by just talking to my professors) and study a lot! If you somehow have above a 3.8, you are a God. I don't see how it is possible but I have two close friends who pull it off somehow, and are still some of the most social people I know. It can definitely be hard to manage, but (as any tour guide will tell you) there are so many resources on campus to do well in your classes - not many people actually use them which is where a lot of us fall short sometimes. For me, my biggest issue with Tech is the negative/competitive vibe on campus that my friends at other schools don't seem to be stuck with. Some people (not all) seem to always be comparing how miserable they are and give up pretty quickly. Even people who are doing well in their classes seem to always be complaining about how much everything sucks. But, I found it easy to surround myself with people who are positive and have supported me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to end with one more positive: I think Tech is becoming more and more self-conscious of its problems. More students are beginning to be vocal about their issues, and I know of few other schools with a fairly united student body when it comes to important issues. Although there has been a lot of not-so-great things happening on campus these past two years, I think the push for better mental-health awareness and sexual violence prevention have been two of the biggest highlights of my time here. Although our on-campus resources are not the most well-funded for the amount of students struggling, the fact that people are talking about important issues and are making themselves available to others, makes me proud to go here. Although I could have had a way easier time at another school and perhaps a lot more crazy stories, I wouldn't give up all of the great people I've met, the job opportunities I have gotten, and the interesting things I have learned in my major-classes that I don't think I would have gotten anywhere else.

&amp;#x200B;

But if you are anything like I was, there is no way you can really know what any college will offer you until you actually go there. Although I am sharing my personal experience, I think it really depends on your reasons for choosing a college and the type of person you are. If you want a simple answer, come here if you want a top-ranked education and if you want a good return of investment/few loans. I would advise you not to come to Tech if want a really good GPA without putting in a lot of effort (being top of your class in high school doesn't really translate here lol).

I wish you luck with your decision!

comment,"On the topic of ease: I do think it's important to note that ease comes in different forms. Having recorded lectures, for example, makes a class easier because you're less dependent on understanding the material based on the first presentation, you're less likely to fall behind because you got sick and missed class, etc. None of that really has anything to do with how much you can learn, it just affects how much control you have over your performance. That kind of philosophy pervades the online course: you have a lot of control over your course experience and a lot of transparency into your current performance, in ways that just aren't possible in a traditional class.

So, I wouldn't equate ease with how much you learn. We've published studies on the online course that show online students learn at least as much.

That said, there is more to success than just how much you learn. The tests you take in the traditional version are more similar to tests you'll take in later CS classes (e.g. handwritten code). To succeed in CS, you need to learn how to attend and learn from a synchronous lecture. In the traditional version, you'll learn how to take a traditional CS class as well as learning the CS1301 material itself. Then again, the online course has benefits to teaching you (or forcing you to learn) more time management skills, and focuses more on debugging (because everything is auto-graded and graded in an all-or-nothing fashion, so you have to keep trying until you get it totally right).

So, which is right for you isn't an easy question to answer. The only strong evidence we have shows (a) they're about equal in terms of learning gains and outcomes, and (b) students who have previously struggled with CS seem to do better online.",Neutral,"education, online learning, traditional learning, teaching methods, student success, learning outcomes, time management, performance, control, synchronous lecture, auto-grading, debugging, cs1301, cs classes.",7,2019-03-28

He was using another professor‚Äôs lecture slides, and it was evident during many lectures that he had not previously reviewed the slides or done the example problems. This led to him struggling to complete examples and then offering extra credit for people who could go up front and show how to do them. 

He also seemed obsessed with getting the grades to fall on a bell curve (I‚Äôve notice many of my courses here have an inverse bell curve with a lot of near perfect scores and a lot of really low scores). This resulted in him trying to make tests really hard and then offering a ton of extra credit. 

He did get better over the semester though. His lectures were painful in the beginning for reasons already mentioned, but by the end he seemed to get all of his ducks in a row. He also genuinely cared that students did well and learned the material. He offered tons of help both in class and out of class. He also lets you use a crib sheet on exams, which most professors for 2551 that semester did not.",Negative,teaching,1,2019-03-28

comment,"All I know is that if you can reduce problem A into problem B then that means B is atleast as hard as A since A is in the class NP. For example you can reduce the independent set problem into the vertex cover problem.
Both vertex cover and independent set are problems that revolve around finding a certain subset of vertices, the former with representatives of every edge, the latter with no edges. Let's say we have a graph G which has vertices V and edges E.  If S is the vertex cover of graph G, the remaining vertices S-V must form an independent set, for if there were an edge with both vertices in S-V, then S could not have been a vertex cover. This gives us a reduction between the two problem.

You gotta look at which NP hard problem you are going to use to reduce your problem to. So that means you need to understand all the NP hard problems so you can make the simplest reduction. It takes practice","Neutral

comment,"I did Grand Challenges (GC) my first year, and I recommend it for being (in my opinion) the most \*potentially\* valuable LLC. Essentially, it is your opportunity to choose a group with similar interests and do guided research your freshman year. We were assigned a graduate student to be our mentors and had a class twice a week where we learned about teamwork/start-ups and how to turn an idea into a company.

When it comes to the living situation, I think the dorms are about the same if not slightly better than the majority of the dorms, with the exception of Glenn/Towers. The advantage of GC was that we were the only ones with our own 3D printers. We also had a piano and a lounge on the basement floor with couches and a TV that a lot of people used for movie nights/video game tournaments/music sessions.

A lot of people call LLCs a cult because they have the closest living community (which is their intention). Since LLCs are an ""extra"" thing you do your first year, the people in them can be kind of weird/nerdy (not all). We had free mandatory retreats at the beginning of the semester (white water rafting in the Fall and Tennessee/aquarium in the Spring) which are pretty fun except they last all day and are mandatory which takes \~some\~ of the fun out of it.

We all lived together, took the same class two days a week (if not more), had optional dorm activities that I think every dorm does, plus had the mandatory LLC retreats. This led to a lot of people becoming really close to one another, and I think the cult label on them stems from this, because most people don't make a lot of friends outside of their LLC. If you chose on-campus apartments your second year, you can even chose to live on a special floor in the NAVE apartments that consists of only other people from your LLC. My best friend and I met because we were in the LLC together, but we both dropped it after our first year because we weren't as passionate about our respective projects. I recommend making friends in your classes/joining organizations outside of an LLC if you want to diversify your friend group, about 1/3 of my GC class and I went Greek.

That leads me to my last point, although I think Grand Challenges has the most potential for being useful towards your resume out of all of the LLCs, it can easily suck the most. If you are like me (and most people honestly) and come into college thinking you are going to be passionate about one topic/major for all four years, you are probably wrong. I came in EE wanting to study alternative energy, and by the end of my first Fall semester, I switched to CS wanting to pursue software design. This led to me losing interest in my alternative energy-focused project, which made my Spring semester GC course more of a chore. More than half of my group continued our project their second year though, and they have made the effort to actually make a real company out of their product, making a functional prototype, actually going to energy conventions, and meeting with companies.

I am glad I got the experience doing research my first year, and working in a team has helped me with my later project-based CS classes, plus I met a lot of my friends during my first-year LLC dorm. Although the class itself wasn't great, it was an easy A on my transcript. IDK all the new LLCs they are introducing, but if you are interested in the concept, I would just submit an application - they are non-binding. If you get into any, then I would recommend reaching out to one of their student ambassadors and hearing their personal experiences before you make a decision. Make sure to ask specific questions about the quality of the dorm/rooms themselves, the classes/instructors, and what are the mandatory/optional activities that are exclusive to that LLC. Hope this helps!

We've had some intermittent reports of people seeing errors when they try to log into Outlook via [http://mail.gatech.edu](http://mail.gatech.edu).  This is why most of us in IT usually harp on sending tickets to support@oit.gatech.edu so we can document the problem.  Most of what we've heard is anecdotal so it has been hard to track down.  One member of my team was able to reproduce the error and then couldn't within minutes.  We suspect that there are a few things at play here:  network issues and the sizing of the VM's that run mail.gatech.edu.  (I'm wondering if OP was on eduroam when they had the problem.)  I think network latency is contributing, but not the cause and our VM's are more to blame because they are old, underpowered, and old.  This is why I haven't engaged the network team or [/u/blamethenetwork](/u/blamethenetwork) would be standing at my office right now.  

GT Login has a relatively low timeout to prevent certain MiTM attacks and that is causing the timeout when our mail.gatech.edu VM's take their time responding to GT Login.  The web app really isn't needed any more and we've been planning on retiring those VM's for a while.  ""It just worked""^TM in the past so we didn't mess with it.

Orgo 2 also requires a lot of practice and is generally a struggle. I wouldn't personally take it with 2100, maybe in the semester you take Thermo I (thermo and numerical methods were easier imo). I don't remember synth lab being hard, but I took it in a summer so my experience may have been different. As long as you prepare for lab, they're easy to understand. I can't remember well, but i think only wrote one major lab report with all parts included; most of the time they just wanted results and discussions.

Most frats have only a handful of parties over the semester and so it can be kind of hit or miss depending on the weekend. In general I think a lot of parties here are kinda meh, you'll have fun but IFC/GT kill a lot of the fun compared to state schools like UGA--starting next year, parties will officially have to be beer and wine only, which is gonna get enforced for registered parties because IFC sends people to monitor your party. Unregistered parties are generally more fun but they are smaller by definition and it's too risky to let in random geeds usually, so don't expect to go to many unless you're in a frat, a girl, or have really close friends at other frats.

Advice:

1) Get a good fake. You'll need one to get drinks at parties (they give you a wrist band, the bouncers will take pretty much any ID though) and for going to Buckhead/other bars.

&amp;#x200B;

For me, I didn't interact with other Koreans at all because most of them came directly from Korea and still had strong attachments to the Korean culture (age hierarchy, frequent drinking, the usual) which I was not comfortable with having been in the States for 8 years now. I mostly stuck with other Asian folks who were either born here or are 1.5 generations like myself. It's probably what you want if you have a similar background.

&amp;#x200B;

You shouldn't feel embarrassed about feeling lonely. Instagram makes every seem like they're having the time of their lives, hanging out with friends in all these great places and what not, but really everyone is busy shoving their heads into textbooks all week. I don't know if you've noticed, but if you walk into the student center building nearly a third of the people sitting there are sitting by themselves gazing into their smartphones. It's not abnormal to feel lonely, especially at such a hard core school like Tech. So don't feel bad, ya know?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, counseling can be very beneficial. They're not gonna give you any tangible solutions to your issue, but at least they'll listen to you. And often times, all you need to do is to vent out at someone, have someone listen to you and empathize with you. I've visited my school's counseling center many times and it really helped me to through my depressing freshman year. The idea of going there might make you uncomfortable, especially being sort of a taboo in Korea, but it just might work for you.

comment,"Couple of edits:

1. It's not grade deflation as much as it is lack of grade inflation (sorry, Harvard).
2. What is ""great teaching?""

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who graduated Tech and worked as a surgical assistant for almost two years intending to do PA at Emory-

Would like to open with saying- I feel that it's a poor idea to try to ""game"" college. I did that for pre-med, did well at it, worked in the field, and ultimately ended up in computer science as of now. Four years is longer (in the sense of learning what you like) and shorter (in the sense of nothing fully prepares you for industry) than you think.

&amp;#x200B;

However, if you want to play numbers, my initial reaction is to say go to UGA, UTK, or any other reasonably solid state school. Major in something that ISN'T biology (med schools see BS Bio on a million applications every cycle), get a 3.5-4.0, get your pre-reqs, get a solid MCAT, and move on. \*if you are CERTAIN that you want to be a doctor\*. Like, since birth. Seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's inaccurate to say that grades are deflated. I like to use the term ""academic waterboarding."" Your early classes are pretty strict with 10 point brackets, an A is an A, not really curvy, etc. But for 3XXX, 4XXX classes, I remember making lots of 40s-60s on exams and initially freaking out, but then realizing that I always made As and Bs in courses, even if the prof said no curve. Another phrase to keep in mind is ""don't outrun the bear, outrun the other campers."" i.e. getting a 75 when the average was 50 is excellent.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to say the average GPA at Tech is somewhere around 3.0. I know med schools want to see 3.5+, but keep in mind that medical schools in the southeast (\*especially\* Emory, Morehouse, GRU) will know why your 3.4 is worth as much (or more) than a 3.9 at KSU.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, as someone who had his heart set on being a doctor from the beginning, I can't fully explain to you how much college can change (or not change) your outlook on what you want as a job, income, lifestyle, etc. I'm sticking to my ""don't try to game it"" comment.",Neutral,"college, medical school, grades, career, gpa",8,2019-03-30

comment,"Haha no problem. If your GPA from last semester is above a certain point you should get honors cords. I'm pretty sure your advisor will let you know and then you pick them up from the registrar's office.

comment,"Grade deflation isn‚Äôt a thing a tech. In fact, the average GPA has been rising over the years (although that‚Äôs mostly due to the students getting smarter). Most professors have cutoffs for an A, and if you make that cutoff, you‚Äôll get an A (even if that‚Äôs 75% of students). There are some rare cases where this isn‚Äôt the case, but those professors are rare. 

As to your question about neuroscience, if you‚Äôre interested in it, then go for it. Don‚Äôt choose your major based on something like grade deflation, as that‚Äôs not going to bode well for you in the long term.

comment,"I mean, I can sympathize with OP here: private events should probably not take up one of the few remaining dedicated quiet spaces on campus. Future events like this may want to consider alternative venues (though it's entirely possible that none existed).

However, one needs to consider that there's lots of alternatives for students here available over the weekend that are quiet or effectively quiet.

comment,"Georgia spends $2.3 billion a year on the University system, that doesn't include the scholarships that come from the lottery. There is no state property tax in Georgia, so no property tax goes to the state, and the majority of the state's funding comes from income and sales tax, as well as vehicle registration and corporate tax. Without your parents living here it doesn't contribute to any of this, so really violates the spirit of in state tuition.

That being said I can't imagine they wouldn't want to see a tax filing in Georgia showing they work here too, because you can have property in Georgia by just renting, but best just ask them. I'm sure they're using the term domicile to mean your permanent residence, which most states use a lived in ""for six months and one day"" out of the year, and that's usually backed up by what state you're getting paid in by submitting W-2s.",Neutral,"state funding, taxes, in-state tuition",8,2019-03-31
