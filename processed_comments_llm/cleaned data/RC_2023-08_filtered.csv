comment,"I mean I am not disagreeing with you since the purpose of GaTech is to serve the Georgian residents. But, let me get this straight.

For every department at Georgia Tech, and take ISyE and CoC for example since I am associated with them, I can assure you that the majority of the professors are born outside of the US and the majority of the doctoral students in these departments, who are doing the bulk of the research work, and masters students are also born outside of the US. 

This is to say that without international students, GaTech is fucked big time both in terms of research and graduate degree money; I am damn sure it is the same for MIT, CalTech, UIUC, and CMU as well (all have engineering departments with similar to and/or higher caliber than GT). 

That being said, it's definitely not the redneck rural Republican-voting Georgians, who will carry GaTech's name globally, which is what President Cabrera wants (he himself was an international student before naturalization). And I am sorry to say this: a lot of international students on average are smarter than your average rural Georgians LMAO. Hell, if not for GT, I would have never come to Atlanta.

Why do you even bring up that you think that international students are smarter? How does that help your argument unless you believe that you deserve special treatment for being “better”.

comment,"Yup! Anyone can minor in anything. The CS minor is competitive (very few people that apply actually get in) but it’s possible to take the classes and just get it retroactively awarded (just have to always register phase 2 so it’s a bit iffy) 

The T&M program does do a CS option as well (if you are business you do the CS classes or engineering classes and vice versa if you are CS/engineering major) here’s a link to check it out (it says the CS concentration is IT management so a bit different but another option) https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/centers-and-initiatives/steven-a-denning-tech-and-management-program/index.html

comment,"Bruh, wtf....you literally nitpicked the part about special consideration when I was complimenting the entire thing, which includes both pros and cons, and asking why not a lot are upvoting it :((

You also brought up (for no reason) that you think rural students are dumber, which is indeed classist (the belief that poorer people are inferior). Many of my rural friends are incredibly intelligent and successful. >>>  I am sure your ""rural"" friends are intelligent and successful. That I agree. But, nothing wrong with being classist and/or elitist when OOS and international students in general have to work harder to get into GT than your ""rural"" friends. If you disagree with me on this, feel free to check out the undergraduate admissions statistics yourself lol.

 Yes, research brings in a lot of money to the school, but rural students do often do research and yes, going back and being an engineer to an underserved area is very important, which is why the school was formed. >>> I am sure this is the case for undergrads, but as I said, for grads, especially international PhDs like myself, research money should and must come first. Because after all, what the labs are doing is to advance the field (be it CS, ISyE, ME, CEE, etc.). Hell, I came here because I wanted to do research, and advance in THE field, and GT is known for what I want to do, but I did not come here to contribute to rural Georgians. Also, I am not even from Georgia or a US citizen, so give me one reason why I should give a s\*\*\* about these rednecks or people in Atlanta (unless the latter are my potential employers who can sponsor me LOL); they can continue voting Republican and restricting whatever rights minorities and women have, and I am getting the hell out of here to do my OPT elsewhere once I am done.

comment,"I know this comment was a while back, but I have a question that admissions answered pretty vaguely. I'll probably be applying for CS and my university's Intro to CS course is labeled as ""Appropriate Department Must Evaluate"" on the course transfer table. Will it still satisfy the CS 1301 course requirement for admission? I understand it won't be evaluated for credit until I'm admitted, but I want to make sure I'm not rejected by the technicality that my institution's Intro to CS course doesn't automatically award equivalent transfer credit to CS 1301.

When I asked admissions, they mostly just said that I should take the best available coursework at my university and that ""There is no penalty or negative impact to a student's transfer application if their institution or coursework is not listed (or says Department Must Evaluate) on the transfer equivalency table.""

I am aware it’s easier to get in from rural areas, however I don’t see why you need to be mean and just shit on people for no reason, which is what I’m calling you elitist. I also generally disagree with making sweeping negative statements about groups of people. Like why bring it up? Also while it’s easier to get in, many of these students overcame economic hardship and lack of opportunities as opposed to rich international students who had access to tons of tutors and private education. Just keep that in mind if you’re going to be mean. The same arguments that you make against could also be used for kids from the city of Atlanta, but you don’t use them because you know that would cause you to catch more heat. 


Also, many in state students are only here because it’s cheaper, whereas you are here because you couldn’t get in anywhere better. So while there’s many instate on lower end of students at this school, there are also many on the higher end (mainly applies to undergrad) that could have gotten into MIT, Cal Tech, etc. but are avoiding debt. I am instate (not rural) and have had many OOS and international students more than happy to mooch off of me for group projects.

The event got away from its original concept of new members in fraternities and sororities meeting each other and turned into new sorority members having to submit themselves in front of frat guys to be judged on their attractiveness. Now hear this: that kind of thing is not fun for girls.  It's uncomfortable at best.  It's horrible for girls who are shy. It's downright humiliating when some girls get roses and then others don't. Believe it or not, girls who get the roses hate seeing that happen to their friends and being in the middle of it. Being forced to do it over and over and over again in front of each frat house is misery. It's disgusting to think this is okay for others' entertainment.  And there actually were physical injuries, heat stroke, asthma attacks, and some members couldn't participate because of physical limitations.  

With that said, guys, you are being pretty insensitive about this, and OP, cherry picking stuff out of the document to make a real issue look foolish is really low.  Girls were afraid to speak up publicly for fear of pushback and the kinds of things that y'all are saying on here, but there have actually been lots of complaints by sorority members on the DL over the years, which is the truth even though you personally don't know about it.  There were some sorority members who didn't see what was wrong with it but they were actually a vocal minority who backed down when they heard some of the stories. This was not about being PC, execs were not wielding their power, they were finally doing the right thing by their memberships that had been against it for so long.

If this looks insane, it is. I came from a private high school where everyone was encouraged to be top-of-the-class and super-competitive, while I just wanted to do science, engineering, and research stuff for the love of it. Looking back, I definitely could have focused my time and energy better when planning for college and my interests.

In some ways, you can make comparisons between public vs. private schools, the type of people you will be around, the connections and opportunities around you, what city you will live in, what school has the best programs for your interests, and the environment the school fosters for its students.

I made my decision based on the fact I wanted to be in the best electrical and computer engineering (ECE) program. That put GT, UIUC, and Perdue at the top. I visited GT and immediately loved the campus and all the opportunities around. I remember talking to some students and professors who were just around in Klaus and Van Leer and immediately clicking with all the stuff they were talking about. I didn't think I wanted to live in Urbana-Champaign or West Lafayette anyways and would rather be in Atlanta, so I decided on GT right when I came back home after the trip. Note I could have stayed in-state (Florida), and it would have been essentially free, but the opportunities and quality of engineering programs were just not as good for what I was interested in (not to dis on the schools, they have other great programs in engineering, pre-law, and pre-med). I was lucky and am thankful in this regard to be able to have the means to attend GT.

Overall, I am really happy I ended up at GT for many academic and personal reasons. I liked this place so much that I stayed at GT for my Masters degree and, currently, my Ph.D. degree. It's also pointless to stress about past decisions after so many life events have gone by, but I am happy with where I ended up, and GT is a amazing school to be at.",Positive,college decisions,1,2023-08-02

comment,"I am a long time removed from that decision and a lot has changed since then. But I had my heart set on Tech since seventh grade when I decided I wanted to be a EE. I was a Tech sports fan as well so it was a perfect combo.

I applied only to Tech, Clemson, and Auburn. Was accepted at all three but I had never set foot on the AU campus. That was a safety school for my safety school.

Clemson made it tough on me. I went to their recruiting weekend. I was going to be in their Honors college and they were waiving my out of state tuition. I received letters with handwritten notes. They did a great job recruiting me. To be honest Tech didn’t do any of that. They emailed my high school physics teacher who wrote a recommendation letter for me to ask why they didn’t get me.

Back then, you had to apply for the President’s Scholarship separately. I met the requirements so I applied, was invited to interview, made the cut to the campus stage, and ultimately won the Recognition version of the PS. That included all the benefits of the program but partial money. That sealed the deal. While Tech never recruited me like Clemson did, winning the scholarship closed any small thoughts I was having about Clemson. 

To this day, I have a soft spot for Clemson. Other than Gameday, I like the school, wish them well in football so long as it doesn’t hurt us, etc. But I’ve not one minute ever regretted picking Georgia Tech.

GT's first LMS was WebCT, an on-prem solution.   It worked fairly well, but was nearly impossible to back up (it consumed/created inodes  at an insane rate. If you took a 10 question quiz, you personally created ELEVEN files) It was also challenging to update. In addition,  migrating to the next generation of it was going to be a full, painful reimplementation.  


T-Square followed.  It was based on the open-source LMS called Sakai  (Yes, it **was** named for one of the original Iron Chefs!)    It was on-prem and database-driven rather than the extremely bushy filesystem of WebCT.  


During this time, some of the employee-facing LMS systems maintained by HR were based on Desire2Learn (D2L), which is the preferred LMS across the University System. (Also on-prem)

When it came time for a (badly overdue)  major upgrade to T-Square/Sakai, we were once again faced with an upgrade that would essentially have been a full reimplementation.

I later got into GT, and I graduated this summer!

Thankfully, I wasn’t penalized for dropping the course, so I don’t think your son would have to worry about any such penalties for his application as well, given that the proper guidelines are followed. 

From an academic perspective, however, I would still encourage taking CS 1301 during high school, because I felt that I would have benefitted more from that course in high school rather than during college. It’s a good introduction to programming, and the course isn’t too demanding, as it is an intro course.

To be fair I haven't been to RFTR and I don't know what it's like, and there's nothing wrong with an event where freshman meet other freshman. But according to this document and another commenter here it wasn't a pleasant experience anymore for the girls so they changed it so it was more enjoyable for everyone. Why is that a problem?

Now that we have in-state tuition her scholarships cover pretty much everything. But for her, the fit was well worth that $25k. GT’s curriculum worked better for what she wanted to do with robotics — CMU’s was very CS-heavy — and she had an opportunity with Tech to do extracurricular competitive robotics that wasn’t the same at CMU. But more than that, she just felt at *home* at Tech. She didn’t love Pittsburgh, and though CMU’s campus is gorgeous she didn’t feel as comfortable there as she did at GT.

Do you think world would be better off if this person was to retake the class (which I’m assuming is plenty irrelevant to their major/prospects if they’re putting it off for senior year) just so they could fit a distribution someone else decided? “But they need to work (as) hard (as me) in order to succeed!” you may cry. 

You’ve been soaked so far deep into bureaucratic silliness that you forget what this is about. If they were truly undeserving of the degree then it’ll bite them in the ass later, given the crazy presumption that they’ll be employing 2550 in their job to the point they’d get fired for it. An extra semester is a huge nuisance for some, and financially devastating for others. Are you really going to froth at the mouth at the thought of this person having to retake the class?

“Why should someone else’s incompetence burden me? >:(“
If you really see it as a burden then I kinda fear for your character. Takes under a minute to do a kind thing.

The person who was randomly placed in the room you were swapping into was in fact randomly placed, and instead should have been put in the room you are in now. 

Also, you can definitely still room swap. While it sucks that the person who agreed to swap is no longer an option, if one of the other people in your friend's room is willing to swap, it is still very doable. 

Once one of them agrees to swap (hopefully the new one who was randomly placed), you and them need to fill out this form: [Housing Ticket](https://mycampussupport.gatech.edu/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=4679243021197). You input your name, GT ID, and select ""Room Swap"" as the request. Then describe the room you are in, the room the other person is in, that you would like to room swap, and that the other person filled out the same form. Remember, you both need to fill it out. 

Once you do this, you will get an email from housing stating that you have been swapped. In my experience it usually only takes them a few hours if you submit it on a business day. 

I hope this helps. Just know that you are not the only one getting screwed by GT Housing. I know all of this because I spent the whole summer waiting for my friend to get off the waitlist and then fighting tooth and nail to get into the same room as them. It super sucks but usually these things work out. You still have two whole weeks before school even starts. And word of advice, offering money is a great way to incentivize a swap.

Student body involvement is top notch here - while we may not have the best school spirit at sports games in the state, our school spirit is expressed in other ways! For example, at my old university (small public USG school) there were only about 35 clubs available for students to join. 

At GT, [there are over 600+ active clubs](https://gatech.campuslabs.com/engage/organizations) - and that number continues to grow each semester! We've got some really cool traditions at football/basketball games too - look up ""[Horse Georgia Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17iItApzUbc)"" or ""[Budweiser Georgia Tech](https://youtu.be/ST4sp2iCqM4)."" And up until COVID hit, it was tradition that they'd usually (but definitely not always) [get someone from the skydiving club to parachute over grant field during homecoming games](https://youtu.be/yhUMnRxC1tk)! That or [there would be a military flyover with some really cool jets](https://youtu.be/lvlX2Fb0kZM)! 

While I can't comment too much on the whole ""get in get out"" thing since I'm pretty new here myself, I will say that GT is where you go if you have a passion for STEM and want to be around others with passions for STEM in the southeast. At my old school, I met people whom you just described too - who maybe liked what they were studying but just want to make money, [at Tech people have genuine passions for what they're studying](https://youtu.be/Xwdd9U9XN4w). 

My advice to you would be to look into what you're actually interested in studying, and ask yourself if you're okay with being surrounded with others that also adore the same thing as you. If yes - I think you'll be a perfect yellow jacket and fit right in here with us! 

Lastly, [look into doing the REP program at your current school](https://www.usg.edu/committees/view/regents_engineering_pathways)! It depends on alot of factors, but I've never met someone who did it and was in-state that got rejected! While it's not guaranteed, it'll make admission significantly more obtainable and easier with the help of the REP advisors!

Tell the dealer what state you're registering the car in and they _should_ know what to do. Every state is a little different though so be prepared to navigate some bureaucratic BS. If you transfer the registration within 6 months, the new state will probably seek proof of the sales you originally paid.

Hello everyone! I have an unfortunately even more frustrating update for you all. We went back and forth this morning with housing, and they told us that we had to reach out to the roommates and get one of them to agree to room swap by the end of the day (6:00pm) TODAY or else there would be no room swapping period. 

So it looks like we would not be able to room swap at any time as some commenters said. Anyways, we emailed all of the roommates to see if they wanted to room swap today THREE times (we did not have their phone numbers) and none of them responded! So it is now 6:37pm, we have no responses from any roommates, and it looks like housing will continue to refuse to help us with a problem that they created!! In fact, it appears they are being even more strict with us now.

With a degree from tech, there's probably a lot of other stuff you could be doing with your time outside of medicine. What's your major?
I would really think about why your family is putting those expectations on you. Do they just want you to be successful? Is there something specific about medicine(which is broad enough as it is, to be fair) that they want you to have/be a part of?

Before long, I found myself as a senior in college having to figure out all over again what I wanted to be when I grew up. 

Know this: You get to control your own destiny, and life's too short to suffer through. Also (and I wish younger me would have learned this faster) you have the right to change your mind about what you want to do. I've found that no one really knows what they want to be when they grow up, whether they're 22 or 62, and there will always be opportunities will come up that could take you on a radically different path. I started wanting to go to medical school, then maybe wanting to do R&D, then actually going to school for and starting in regulatory affairs in medical devices, and now, because of experiences I got to have in my early career, I'm a patent practitioner. Each step was an interesting adventure in its own right, but not exactly a tidy straight line. 

My two cents? Take a breather from the stress of Tech and think about what you really want. Go see what's out there at career fair sessions, or otherwise work for a little while in something in your chosen field. I personally found that going to information sessions from industry helped put opportunities on the table that I hadn't previously thought about because I was so preoccupied with the childhood aspirations that held me hostage. Even if it just teaches you that's not what you want to do, you will still know more than you did and can go from there.

comment,"From someone who did study abroad in the US, Denmark, Germany, and Japan, my honest opinion is to stay in the US. Couple of reasons:

1. Whether Europeans like it or not, US schools have more funding in general to pursue research endeavors. Of course, I recognize the welfare system in Europe.

2. Sure, in Europe, you do masters and then PhD, where the latter is just research. But in the US, even within the PhD, you take classes and can still choose to do another masters IF you think you need more skill sets (p.s: I applied to PhD programs all places barring Denmark and US is just too attractive despite all the shitshow here).

3. You are looking at a prestige factor for PhD programs, which will end up hurting you if you end up with shitty advisors and people who are not invested in you. 

4. The research environment; US is just more interdisciplinary with their approaches. For example, I know of Dr. Goldsman robotics lab, where you work with people from across disciplines. In Europe and Japan, it definitely is not the same. 

5. Also, politically, is US really that bad compared to European places? I know my European friends from Germany like to trash US and the moment they get offer from US PhDs, 95 percent of them will jump ships. Also, I don’t know man; US is more diverse in general (in Europe, it’s just a handful of capital cities) and I felt more integrated here. 

6. When you say most people, is it your average Joe OR your PhD employers? Because the last time, I checked GT is quite well known when it comes to STEM fields. Your average Joe only knows MIT and Harvard because they don’t do research and they only watch Hollywood movies. And also, I know a phd grad in the ME department (he’s American), doing research at Max Planck Institute; his research is on robotics and elephants and it was advertised on GT daily newsletter (you know the thing GT sends out daily) so I naturally “stalked” him 😂😂

These are all the reasons I can think of for now.

I don't want to get into the politics too much, but I've had bad experiences with the healthcare system (no emphasis on preventative care, got MRSA following a medical procedure, need a third surgery on my toe bc they keep fucking it up). Also, the US is objectively worse for LGBTQ rights than most northern European nations. My existence here as a trans woman is very politicized, and what rights I have hinges too heavily on whoever wins in 2024.

comment," I would highly recommend it. In my opinion, it is the best place to live ""on campus"" if you are a grad student. Compared to the cost and location of other apartments in Atlanta, it's pretty much the best deal you can get. One big advantage is that the fixed monthly cost includes all utilities, including the internet. It's a quiet place to live, and maintenance is responsive. I enjoyed being able to be right on campus and walk/scooter in the morning and late at night, and the walk to Publix is not bad.

They also currently come unfinished, but I believe next summer they plan to renovate some of the family housing to be furnished; I think just the single rooms, but I don't remember. (I think it's a bad idea since this housing option is supposed to be more like an apartment than a dorm, but they claim that they want to support an increase in demand from international and out-of-state students moving to Tech for grad school and making it easier for them by including furniture. Sounds good ""on paper,"" but I have some objections to this and there are many other practical issues.)

Another nice thing is that once you are in, you can stay in the same apartment as a guaranteed registration as long as you make sure to let them know you want to stay every housing application cycle. They also allow you to leave over the summer for internships and keep your same apartment for the fall, and so on. The only hiccup is that they will shuffle everyone around next summer when they renovate and add furniture (I don't remember if the moving around is just for the summer or if your relocated room is your new room going forward). I don't know the details, but you can ask housing about this.

Besides that, I would just follow all the logistics, dates, and announcements from housing as closely as possible to ensure you are one of the first people to register. I set up a tool to check for updates on the housing website to see when links or info were updated. I also checked the housing application portal multiple times a day around the dates it said it would open. If you are in a long-term relationship but not married, I would highly recommend taking the domestic partner route to get higher priority if that is an option. You can organize that easily and get it all done through the dean of students.

It's great to hear about your fantastic job programming for a large software company.

You can check out this article ([https://www.cleveroad.com/blog/software-development-companies-atlanta/](https://www.cleveroad.com/blog/software-development-companies-atlanta/)) for a list of software development companies in Atlanta. It provides insights into several companies that might align with your expertise. Best of luck with your decision!

comment,"It sounds like you had been going through a hard time and I am glad that things are looking up for you. 

As someone who is a senior (and also a transfer student) and who also have to deal with stuffs in my life beyond college, I would also want to add that you need to make sure that Georgia Tech has the institutional resources to support your needs, especially if you are someone who holds multiple marginalized identities, whether you are a person of color, queer, working class, etc., since people with those marginalized identities (including myself) tend to have grievances with the institution (Georgia Tech also published [a campus climate report](https://diversity.gatech.edu/about/news-and-events/institute-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-announces-results-2022-campus-climate-survey) about this).  

The fact that you had to transfer out of Georgia Tech to cope and deal with your personal matters (your self-esteem, your family, your relationships, etc.) is a red flag because the institution failed to support your challenging situation when things get rocky on your side.

I am writing this with my experience as someone who is queer, colored (Asian specifically), first-gen immigrant with his working-class parents, so what apply to me may not apply to you. With that being said, I just barely survive Georgia Tech because it is extremely challenging to hold everything together at Tech while dealing with family, financial, (and even medical) matters.

comment,"Thank you! In your opinion, would it be smarter to apply as the major i want to change to (Mathematics with a concentration in either Pure math or Probability and Statistics) or as the major i have a stronger application for (BBA concentration in finance)? 

I discovered my appreciation for mathematics and my desire for a quantitative/STEM career fairly recently so my ECs (portfolio management group, business club, econ research side project, app for finance currently being developed) are finance based. While i still like finance I want to major in Math because i’ve learned i really like the subject and prefer math based careers (data science, risk, quant) and i’m considering grad school in either computational finance or econometrics. Additionally, I enjoy being rigorously challenged in these areas.

I will have all the course requirements to transfer specific to a math major (Chem, Phys, calc II) before i get to tech if accepted, but EC wise i would be significantly lacking. I was told that if you are transferring from a USG (ga state student currently) school, have a good GPA (i have a 4.0), meet all course reqs, and apply early enough to not have all seats taken it’s a near guarantee that you get accepted assuming you don’t apply CS or Engineering. If this is true i’d rather just apply as a math major, however, I don’t want to diminish my chances at acceptance to Tech.

In your opinion, would it be smarter to apply as the major i want to change to (Mathematics with a concentration in either Pure math or Probability and Statistics) or as the major i have a stronger application for (BBA concentration in finance)? All course reqs will be fufilled for transferring for either major, but my ECs and curriculum make more sense so far for finance and not math.

comment,"It sounds like you're a perfect candidate already! The issue is that Tech won't let you change into a major that's not in the scope of your current one.

For example, if you applied as a transfer student for history or communications, they won't let you switch into a major like Engineering or CS. For that reason, I'd recommend you evaluate what major you want to graduate with and try applying for a degree that's at least somewhat in the same field.

Therefore I'd recommend that you apply for whatever major you want to study in (math w/ quant) - don't worry about your chances of getting accepted! Just try and show a good genuine interest in the subject, and you'll be okay! Remember, you're at an automatic advantage when it comes to admission since your both an in-state student and not apply for engineering/CS! Even if you wanted to still apply for Engineering or CS, you're in good shape if you take over 45+ credit hours at GSU.

Lastly, I've heard about this before but never actually met anyone who had to go through it - sometimes admissions like denying transfer applicants their first time around to weed out kids who apply on a whim and aren't on REP or a pathway.

The rent is $1235 (yup its pretty low) per month including gas and internet. Other utilities, aka renters insurance ($12.95) and trash ($5), are not included in the rent.

The room is on the Moss floor plan. The unit is 1460 sq. ft. with 4 other chill guys who are current GT students and you will have your own bathroom and in-unit washer/dryer. It is right across Tech Square, where you would have access to GT buses to go around campus. The Whistler is less than a 5-minute walk to the MARTA Midtown transit station.

The room includes a full bed, desk, chair, closet, bathroom, washer/dryer, large kitchen, & living room with a great view from the 22nd floor! The building includes a rooftop pool, yoga room, spin room, full gym, coffee shop, and study spaces.

Please message me if you're interested or have any questions! I would love to live here with my buddies, but as much as I would love to my circumstances have changed.

I do believe you were told that, though I do also believe the person you conversed with was mistaken or misinformed.

If it's the one that got added in the living room, it's possible that it didn't get properly connected to the network switch that feeds Building D after construction. If it's one of the others, it should be connected and functional but it's always possible that something else has gone wrong.

Unfortunately, I have to disagree with your premise that wireless can be made reliable enough to rely on.
Especially when you consider that sometimes students might need a reliable fallback in a time crunch, and that students' devices (or the combination of them and eduroam) can be to blame, not necessarily only OIT's wireless configuration.

Two examples. Example #1: I had a wireless-connected printer in my dorm at Woodys. For some reason, the printer would lose connection multiple times overnight, causing it to loudly reboot in our small room at like 3am. I solved this by plugging it in instead. I have no idea how Wreck Techs could've helped with that more than a functioning Ethernet port did.

Example #2: I got a new laptop while working towards a deadline and for some reason, Linux and the wireless card and eduroam do not get along. I solved this by always plugging into the wall at GT, both at my desk and in conference rooms for meetings.

I wasn't deliberately implying that. Wireless networks are not perfect, far from it, and there can never be any guarantee of level of service on wireless. It doesn't matter who makes the wireless APs, who configures them, or how much money you throw at it - RF is a wild, wild world of madness and there's only so much that can be done to tame it.

My intention is what I said - if people are having issues, we'd like to know about it. Can we fix everything? No, definitely not. Are there a lot of things we can fix? Absolutely.

>especially when you consider that sometimes students might need a reliable fallback in a time crunch, and that students' devices (or the combination of them and eduroam) can be to blame, not necessarily only OIT's wireless configuration.

As a GT alum, I 100% agree with everything you said here.

> I have no idea how Wreck Techs could've helped with that more than a functioning Ethernet port did.

While they may not have been able to help too much, they could escalate to my team (OIT network team) and we could try and figure out what was causing the disconnections. Could be something on our end, could be something with the printer, or a combination thereof. That's not nearly as immediate of a fix as plugging it in with a network cable, but still something we could have done.

>With a deadline looming, what was a better use of my time, plugging in a cable and getting work done, or debugging driver bugs and filing help tickets?

No disagreement there. Tickets would be great for our reference so we can work with you to try and resolve it for the future, but wired as an immediate fix is indeed preferable.",Neutral,"wireless networks, oit, gt alum, wreck techs, ethernet, deadlines, help tickets.",1,2023-08-12
