comment,"You've gotten good advice here, but to recap:

1) Resolving an incomplete is between the student and the instructor.  Make arrangements with your instructor.

2)  If at all possible,  try to resolve it early in the semester -- this is at the instructor's discretion.  That way you won't have an *extra* final to schedule at the end of the term, and you will have the material still fresh in your mind.

3) Any incomplete ***must*** be resolved by the end of your next semester of enrollment, or it will automatically ""age"" to an ""F"".   That is still recoverable, but does present extra challenges and is by no means guaranteed.

4) When you've taken the final and your instructor has graded it/computed your final semester grade, they will need to submit an online request for a grade change.  Those are not instant, and require approval from the instructor's dean/department head or a designated alternate. Your instructor should know the URL; if not, their department can advise them.

If the course was a prerequisite for something you selected for Spring term, you will probably  not have been removed from that course.  If you have not registered for such a course, you may well need a permit.",Neutral,academic advice,2,2022-12-31

comment,"High school teachers and counselors will tell you that AP Credits will help you get in, but I have never seen any evidence that that is true in any way, and I am relatively confident they only tell you this because having students take AP classes gets more money directly for the high school than Dual Enrollment does. For starters, whether you take Dual Enrollment or AP Credits is not one of the factors that college admittance boards consider (you can find a list of considered factors for Tech online). It is only important that you take either one or the other, because colleges like Tech do check for rigor within your high school schedule. Secondly, out of all the Tech students I know, I have never seen any indication that taking one over the other has helped anyone get in. Thirdly, I have spoken to a college professor about this, and he stated that he also believes that taking one over the other has no bearing on someone getting in (admittedly, this professor was not a Tech professor, but was a professor within the University System of Georgia).

In terms of which one is more beneficial over all, I would say Dual Enrollment without hesitation. I took some of both, but much more Dual Enrollment. Dual Enrollment can more easily provide you with college credit (as long as you verify that the college you Dual Enroll at can transfer credit to Tech). Also, Dual Enrollment prepares you for the actual structure, speed, and expectations of college MUCH better than AP ever could.

I think it's worth noting that Dual Enrolling at Tech (with a decent degree of success) is a near guarantee to get in. However, it's definitely not a requirement (I Dual Enrolled at a local community college and got into Tech).

The problem with that is Reddit only allows 2 posts (megathreads) to be pinned. If we pin one for admission and another for registration, we won't be able to pin other important posts like housing or announcements without unpinning the other. 

We could however make a post that contains links to specific megathreads (sort of acting like a gateway), but in my experience as a mod, that's known to decrease traffic to those linked posts, which doesn't help the people who need answers.

In my experience when an ""idea-man"" (even though OP has some front-end experience they themself state that the respondent would need to carry) wants a programmer(s) to work on a project like this, a few things typically happen:

1. The project typically fails
2. You end up getting a lot of work done for little or no pay
3. And the most important distinction between these types of projects and normal startups is that you won't be offered partial ownership in the company that you're almost singlehandedly building a product for (if the founder has even bothered to incorporate or create a legal company.)

I'm not saying don't do the project, just that if you choose to do so make sure you're ready to do *all* the work.

comment,"I was in this situation 5 years ago and I regret not switching to CS. I just graduated and I'll be working as an ML engineer. I am an international student (not sure if this applies to you) and historically CS roles have been a lot more accessible for me than IE roles. 

**Getting an internship:**

1. **Overall:** Tech is a great program for both (#1 for IE and #5? for CS) and lots of companies come to campus and recruit tech students.
2. **IE:** I have done multiple internships and every recruiting season, I have had interviews and offers from ""great"" companies. Most of the interviews for me were behavioral with a few exceptions that had me do SQL or a take-home data analysis challenge. I think there is a significant bit of luck involved here since multiple people can be qualified and most companies have limited slots. I have also found my extracurriculars and leadership positions to be really significant here.
3. **CS:** I have only done CS interviews in the last year but I have found that companies are a lot more liberal with giving interviews since most interviews have an online assessment component (Leetcode, hackerrank,etc) which has no human component to it. This increases your likelihood of entering the recruiting pipeline and reduces the luck component. With that said, there is a good bit of preparation that you need to do for these interviews that doesn't apply to IE interviews. I have found projects to be fairly relevant here.
4. Overall, I think IE interviews were easier but had a greater luck component while CS interviews were harder but had a lesser luck component 

**Internship experience:**

1. **IE:** I did not like my internships and found them to be quite boring and repetitive. There was a lot of Excel, a lot of tableau, and a lot of meetings. I wasn't intellectually stimulated.
2. **CS** (data science really): I enjoyed my internship a lot and I developed tangible skills that I could talk about during other interviews. 
3. **Disclaimer:** I am big on the math side of IE and have taken a lot of coding and advanced math classes. I enjoy working with numbers and have grown to like technical things. If this isn't you, my internship experience might not hold true for you

Here are some other factors I would encourage you to consider:

1. Your growth: With a few exceptions, most of my friends didn't start college liking their majors. They grew to like their majors by taking classes and getting more exposure to the subject. 
2. Earning potential: CS jobs will pay you more right out of college than IE jobs will
3. Decision timeline: I am not sure how many credits you have, but you might want to give yourself some more time to make this decision. You could take core classes that count for both while taking CS classes.

While I think you can do a lot of things with an IE + CS minor, in my mind it's a lot easier to demonstrate your non-technical abilities as a CS major than it is to demonstrate your technical abilities as an IE major.

i did ece 2031 for sysarch. i really like sysarch but didn't much care for 2031. not necessarily the content (it's okay, just lower level stuff than 2110 but not what i wanna study) but i really disliked how the class worked. people complain about it enough on this sub so i won't beat that dead horse. but i still like sysarch and I'm now going pretty deep into compilers stuff (only applying for compilers jobs now and going to continue with an MS focusing on that)

how many classes do you need to take after 2031 for devices?

Your threads really won't affect your job search, but will impact how quickly you pick up topics during internships and your ng job.

Anyways I have no idea what your other thread is, but I think info is a better thread than devices because devices suffers this identify crisis of wanting to be halfway between an ECE minor and a sysarch thread, but fails to execute either effectively.          

edit: just saw it was intel. unless you want to go into specifically robotics or autonomy, i think info will be better than devices for your average SWE career. also 2031 was ass but i still wished i would have taken sysarch - would say 2110/2200 is a better litmus test imo.",Neutral,"topics: devices, sysarch, info, threads, job search, internships, ng job, os, db, swe, ece, robotics, autonomy, 2031, 2110, 2200.",2,2023-01-05

1: not sure - dont have any experience with the others but in Epic, and I assume this is true of all of them, its very much dependent on your effort. Definitely get out of it what you put in. Take an active role and you’ll find success in any of these clubs

2: again, not sure, but Epic typically has at least 1 employer event per semester. Not sure what the others do

3: my understanding is that its not difficult to join any of these clubs. Put effort into your application (aka answer all the questions) and you should be fine

4: i know a lot of people who are in more than one of these clubs. They offer different things (nonprofits or small businesses etc) so if you’re interested in 2 of them, go for it but i wouldn’t do more than 2. I’ll also say that Epic at least does not assume any previous knowledge or experience. I would say at least half of the members are 1st years. 

To answer which is best- there really isnt a best one. Your interests may drive you towards one over the others as far as their clients but none are more “prestigious” than the others imo. I went with Epic Intentions just because they work with nonprofits exclusively + i think doing free work for a for-profit company is a bit icky. 

I’ve definitely been asked about it in interviews and I’d say it played a significant part in getting both of my internships thus far. It’s also pretty generally rewarding to help out nonprofits vs a regular company imo. It’s worth repeating though that regardless of the club you join, the most important thing is putting in effort and actively participating.

Cats are smart, they know where your house is if they left it. Put out a familiar wet food (stinkier the better) and some of your dirty laundry if you have it and the cat likes you (and thus your smell). Put these near an enterance to your home that you can open without startling the cat. 

Ideally this would be outside a sliding glass door that you can see through while staying inside. Stay somewhere you can keep the food and laundry in sight. Be prepared to wait for hours, and to have to repeat tomorrow. Cats will usually come back when they get cold or hungry, but are stubborn and can take 2-3 days to decide they want to return. 

My strat on the cats return is to gently coax them towards you once they've had a couple nibbles, start to pet them if they're amenable, then scruff them firmly and quickly carry them back inside.

comment,"Lots of good info, here is a few other items to consider:

* A few weeks is pretty vague - I would choose either to ask to do something like shadow a PI or lab member for a week, or do a longer term research project. Both would look pretty sweet in a college application essay, so don't feel like a shadow is a cop-out. Also, it may be MORE interesting for you to shadow a grad student or post-doc, as they will spend a lot more of their time in lab/researching.

* Having someone under 18 in a lab is can be rough. The PI and anyone you interact with need to be noted and take a training class. They will need agendas, a signed OK from your guardian, and some other forms too. I had a student shadow me for an afternoon once and it was more time in prep/wrap-up than it was with the high schooler. This may dissuade a few PIs from saying yes (or some may... forget... to follow the whole procedure). As others have noted, I would cast a WIDE net, and if you haven't yet also look at places like Emory or GSU.",Positive,"college application, research, grad student, post-doc, lab, pi, training, guardian, forms, emory, gsu.",2,2023-01-06

You want to take a couple semesters to gain the skills that will put you at the level that the labs you are really interested in are looking for. Sure, some professors take IGNITE folks, but there’s little chance that it will be a lab that is both in your specific interest area and that you would want to stick with for several semesters (or years). Enjoy your summer, and if you really feel the need to do something research related, start reading journal articles from Tech physics labs. Use that to narrow down your field of interest and possible labs of interest. Figure out what skills would be needed to contribute to that research, and prioritize taking classes that focus on those skills (CS, specific math, etc) in those first couple semesters. Long term commitment to one lab you love will benefit you more than earlier short term commitment to another that you realize isn’t what you want.

Everyone moves at their own pace, and sometimes people forget to be human with one another when it comes to these things. Just be sure to put the effort in, and you’ll do great!

comment,"Midtown was not very safe in the 1990s before they widened 5th Street when building Tech Square, but it is about as safe as a city space can be right now. There is a separate security force staffed by off-duty APD officers that patrols the area (Midtown Blue) and you are rarely (if ever) walking alone (crimes of opportunity abhor bystanders). Stick to well traveled roads and keep your eyes up instead of looking down at your phone and you will be fine. I can’t stress “eyes up and aware” enough. That’s city walking 101. 

You will more likely encounter the homeless if you are coming from North Ave, but that is easy to manage with a simple head nod and walking without breaking your stride. The only time I was followed in my 25 years in Atlanta by someone in such a situation was Downtown. If you were going to Georgia State it would be a slightly different story: Downtown is simply not as well traveled as Midtown, but even then it takes purposefully avoiding major roads to put yourself in a potentially vulnerable situation.

The unknown is always a little scary. You’ll recognize you have little to fear with some experience. The Midtown station is definitely the play, as others have noted, but you can always cut down Ponce to the Varsity to avoid the majority of homeless interactions between North Ave and The Varsity by the church.",Neutral,"safety, city walking, homelessness.

Shit's expensive in Atlanta, and it didn't help that my license in the US was new (been driving since 18 but in another country)

One thing I will say about insurance companies: in my experience Geico is absolutely horrible in terms of customer service. It was difficult to get a hold of them to chase up my claim, which I would not have expected from them. I had Geico when I first moved to NC but dropped them like a hot potato soon after.

1. Will new sections be added to classes with a long waitlist? I’m trying to get into a lower division CS class &amp; a degree requirement and they both have around 100 people waitlisting across all sections. I’m just wondering if I should look into other classes to stay full time.

ETA: The class I need has more people than the capacity… 

2. Is https://tsuwoto.github.io up to date? And where do people who bring their own lunch tend to eat at? Can I eat at the tables in the academic buildings?

Thursday Night games were legendary regardless of winning or losing.  Everything seems so deflated now.  GT just lacks real leadership.  CPJ was a real leader and the bums that drove him away couldn't handle it.  GT really desperately needs change in a lot of its leadership positions, especially outside of athletics.  We have way too many spineless bums taking paychecks they do not deserve.  The students deserve better.  I hope things change. Go Jackets!  Congrats CPJ!","Positive

comment,"Hmmmm... I don't think there are a lot of consistently-offered classes for specifically data science in the ME undergrad curriculum, but there definitely is a lot of space within ME for simulation and modeling work. It's a skillset that is basically in demand everywhere, especially if you can incorporate other subject matter knowledge with it. I did various sorts of that kind of work in both undergrad and grad ME research. 

One option would be to stick out the ME degree while picking up a minor in Computational Data Analysis or something similar, which would probably set you back the least degree-wise, and then actively pursuing analysis based jobs upon graduation (which you can definitely get with an ME degree). However, you would need to look at the remaining ME requirements you have left and make sure they're not going to make you miserable - the downside of the broad scope of the ME degree is everyone winds up having to take *some* classes they really don't like or care about, but it's best if they're not the majority.

If you really don't want to finish with ME, there is similarly room to carve out a modeling/data/simulation-based specialty in basically any engineering field. Excepting ISYE it's probably simplest in ECE, but you can make any of them work. If you're set on remaining in COE, I would compare pre-reqs to see the impact each possible major might have on your degree timeline, and make decisions about what kind of courseload you're able to take vs how long you're willing to extend your timeline. Also make sure you have at least some level of interest in the main content of the major so you don't wind up stuck in something you hate. 

Other than that, since ISYE does align best with your interests, you can reach out to one of their advisors to ask if there is any feasible path for you to transfer there - the answer may be no, but there's no harm in asking.",Neutral,"education, engineering, career advice",1,2023-01-10

I know nothing about Floor 0 (all boys I believe) of Harrison, I pretend it doesn’t exist. Floor 1 (all boys) has a nice kitchen/lounge setup. Floor 2 (all girls) I believe their kitchen setup is smaller but they have a nice lounge space. Floor 3 (all boys) has a small kitchen space but that’s never been a problem for me. Floor 3 doesn’t have a lounge. Instead we have the “catacombs” which are meant to be a silent space for studying but it seems like they just kind of gave up renovating it so no one really uses it rn, at least last time I bothered looking in there. But you can freely go to floor 1 or 2’s lounge areas. The only real benefit I care for with Glenn is they have an elevator which helps for move in and move out but I don’t think that should be a deal breaker. The big winner for me in Harrison is the showers. About the same size as Glenn’s, but in Harrison it’s like a stall so you can lock the door. With Glenn it was just a curtain so I prefer the security and privacy of a door. Also with Glenn, at least in the summer, the floors were half boys and half girls on every floor except maybe the top floor. In Harrison it is all boys on every floor except floor 2 which is all girls. At least that’s how it is this year.

That equipment has been damaged before by unauthorized users of the classrooms and that creates a lot of problems for an already underfunded program and the student groups that rely on access to those spaces, equipment, and the funding that would be required to replace damaged equipment. i know the Couch practice room situation is not ideal but using the WV rooms without permission creates a lot of problems for others.",Negative,classroom,3,2023-01-11

comment,"Not sure about potential ODS accommodations, but iirc if it’s before the end of the registration phase (I think it ends Friday afternoon?), you can just withdraw from all of your classes and face no penalty, and it’ll be as if you never even enrolled for the semester. No questions asked, and no need to provide documentation. They don’t give you any trouble, and if you’re in good standing, you can easily come back whenever. 

I would recommend doing this before Friday though unless you’re cool with Ws on your transcript. Lmk if you have any more questions bc I’ve been through something similar.

I hung out with some people freshman year but for the most part didn’t fit in. The pandemic happened and that was a nightmare for socializing, cause so many people weren’t on campus and were cautious to hang out irl (be glad you’re not dealing with that!) but afterwards I eventually found a group that I really enjoyed hanging out with. It took a couple years, hopefully it will take less for you cause campus is so active, but just know you don’t have to find “your people” your first year.

comment,"You're extrapolating too far from limited data. You see ""everyone"" with friends and conclude that they're done making friends. There are some issues here:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Everyone would prefer more friends. You, me, your parents, everyone. 
2. Friendships that you see are shallow b/c it's been 1 semester of school. Even seniors have shallow relationships. You don't know who you are yet, you aren't in the real world, and you're going to change several more times before you hit your mid-20s.
3. The way to make friends is to be involved in stuff that you're good at. You'll be confident if you're good (or, if you're terrible, at least really interested in it). Then there will be some social gatherings related to that thing that you do.
4. Clubs are an easy way to meet new people. I also suggest networking with people out of college who do whatever the hell you want to do with your life. You're going to end up with friends in that realm anyway - so why bother waiting until you're done with school? Get started now.

This is my 4th semester at Gatech as a CS Major, and I have never once gotten the classes I wanted to take and have solely relied on this last day of Phase 2 where I sit in front of my computer for 7 hours and try to ""snipe"" classes that spots opened for, which suddenly was taken away from us with the capacity being lower than actual.   


Moreover, I have sent maybe 10-15 emails to advisors, faculty, departments, etc. in my time at tech, and I have received responses a total of 2 times. Not to mention that my advisor has changed twice as well. They are clearly way too busy and overloaded, but that means I don't have a proper form of communication with anybody on the administration side during either phase 1 or phase 2.  


I was on track to graduate in 3 years (which is obviously beneficial for financial reasons), but due to lack of class availability, consistently getting late-time tickets, and receiving no help from the administration, it seems that I'll have to push back my graduation roadmap.

comment,"I guess in this instance it's quite hard to offer anything concrete because no one knows in general whether the capacity will change or not, it's on a case by case basis. Now that I'm thinking about it more maybe it is also a situation problem. Students generally rely on phase 2 friday as a free for all where they can try to get into a class no holds barred. Now, that opportunity is being denied, and we don't know whether or not we'll actually get it before 4 PM. Obviously ensuring that graduating students get what they need is quite important, but the fact that it's being done on this specific day is causing a lot of uncertainty and confusion. It's now 2:20 and as far as I'm aware, no further communication has come on whether or not capacities will be reverted.

Also, I think I might just be misunderstanding, but why wouldn't capacity return to normal once the graduating students are taken care of? If the course is overfull, it would be now be 97/95 (for example, if 2 students who needed it were added), but if people have dropped, then it could be 93/95 or something and then others could register.

Figuring out how this should be addressed should be an ongoing conversation between staff and students, but often the culture at Tech seems to encourage opacity in times like this. I get that may be a resource problem rather than people intentionally lacking transparency, but there are a ton of intelligent individuals at this institution and I'm sure if the right people put their heads together there can at least be iterative progress towards a better solution that leaves less people less stressed out.

I believe it was Dan Forsyth that told me during the week that everyone has the ""Not in Kansas anymore"" moment when their first test grades are coming out that the office with mental health services brings in more staff to handle the influx of students. Maybe it's worth considering applying a similar solution in this situation.

They didn’t make it easy to get involved in any of that, so based on your “avoid large workload” comment, I don’t recommend it.

One note: The # of seats in OSCAR does not always reflect the number of physical seats in the lecture hall. The course in the screenshot is CS 4400 and Clough 144 holds 300 students. As for why they didn't just up the capacity? Probably to ensure the spots go to the people who really need them, and nobody else.

And yeah, this particular scenario sucks if you get shut out, but can we really blame the CoC for prioritizing people who need the course *right now*? In the case of 4400,  taking this later isn't going to hurt many people. It may disrupt your carefully crafted  plan, but it's a prereq for three comparatively unpopular courses.

I came in with issues from before I came to Tech, and knew I needed a psychiatrist guaranteed, and I think they get you in quicker  if you do (but I have no solid proof that's the case). Your CARE Coordinator will pretty much just get you in touch with a therapist, and the therapist I got was pretty good and empathetic. You're limited to 14 sessions which kind of sucks, but it's definitely better than nothing. My psychiatrist was awesome and got me just what I needed but she left Tech recently and my new one isn't the greatest. She cancelled my last appointment less than 10 minutes before it started, told me to go through STAMPS to get it fixed and ghosted me. So I haven't gone in months because the issues that make me need a psychiatrist make it near impossible for me to pretty much start scheduling anew. It's really a hit or miss honestly but I definitely think it's a good place to start, especially if money is an issue and you can't pay for an outside therapist/psychiatrist.

I personally had a good experience using gt care which is why I recommend it. My person was a psychology intern but she was very easy to talk to and it was honestly nice to just have someone to vent to outside of friends and family. But one thing to keep in mind is even if you don’t have the best experience with gt care doesn’t mean that no therapy will help.

comment,"I remember this being fun when I was a freshman; you get to giggle every time you walk by the T you stole.  But as an alumnus, it does start to feel trashy, and to outsiders unfamiliar with the tradition I bet it looks even worse.

Alumni won't change this, they don't care enough.  Admin can't change this, because telling a campus of college students not to do something will only make it worse.  GTPD could pull camera footage and arrest people, but they have bigger issues they need to spend resources on.  I think current students should have their own discussion to whether stealing Ts is a cool thing to do. 
 Yall deserve a pretty campus.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",Negative,"alumni, tradition, campus, t, gtpd, college students, discussion, campus appearance.",42,2023-01-16
