comment,"Hello!! YJFC is (and will always be) the love of my life. I am now an Alumni and was the crewchief for the club while I was in school. 

I am colorblind. This is not a big deal unless you want to go to the airlines. You can get a third class medical with a night flying restriction. This means you can get a PPL, show off all your ""skills"", spend $100 to fly over to a new city just to get a hamburger, give a girl the best date of her life while stalling 314GT at 4000 MSL. You can even get a commericial license and then a CFI cert, the PhD of Flying.

The only restriction is that you cant fly at night and you can't get a second class medical (or a first class) without getting an alternative exam or a SODA from the FSDO. So, you cant be a part 135 pilot or fly part 121 or fly an operation that requires a second or first class medical.

Also AOPA has an article on this too. please google.

Expensive ? You know what makes an airplane fly? its not aerodynamics, its $$$. You are looking at 8-12k to get your ticket. The club is a pretty cheap deal though. I am now in the bay area and spend $150/hr to fly 172s similar to 203 or 314GT which cost $110/hr with the club.

My roommate sought external help, and it helped him a lot, so that's definitely a solid option as well. There really isn't a silver bullet for mental health, and my case was probably not as bad as it can get, so I'd say getting more help than necessary is better than getting less.

comment,"Do you mean CS 2340?

If so, here's the breakdown:

* CS 1332 - grants a big benefit for software interviews (in addition to, you know, a foundation in DS&amp;A). If you wish to pursue software jobs, there's a good chance you'll be asked questions involving material from this course. It doesn't teach much about writing clean or maintainable code, though. It also doesn't touch on how to properly work on applications larger than one or two files/classes, since it's a DS&amp;A course.

* CS 2340 - essentially Intro to Software Engineering. You'll learn a good bit about clean and maintainable code and how to organize and coordinate real-world applications. While this is certainly ***very*** valuable in actual software work, it's not the ""technical interviews"" class that 1332 is.

Honestly with an application like this you're going to be competitive at any school you apply to. The thing is college admissions are extremely subjective and dependent on factors that are totally out of your control- for all you know, the person reading your application might just be having an awful day, which might negatively impact you for no reason under your control.

Do your best and write the best essays you can, but I encourage you to not stress about the college application like me and many of my peers did. You can get a comparable education at any accredited school in  the US, and if you don't get into one of your first-choice schools and you're really fixated on going to a top ""name-brand"" college, literally the worst case is you go to a less good school for a semester or two and transferring.",Neutral,"college admissions, education, stress, transfer",2,2019-09-02

If you want to do anything other than cyber security, Tech is definitely worth the transfer. The classes are (probably) a lot tougher than Augusta, but the Tech name really does help you land a job and it is definitely worth it. To get a better picture of the benefits of Tech, it‚Äôs good to check out the median salaries between Augusta and tech for recent CS grads.

Back when we had Woodie's, a traditional dining hall like Britain and Nave, Kerry's station had food that was a step up from the rest of the options there.  It was usually an Asian dish, and he was pretty much the only one preparing it.  West campus feshmen like myself (at the time) would wait patiently (10-15 mins, while there was no line at other stations), and he'd make conversation while he was cooking.  

Compared to other GT Dining workers there, Kerry seemed to show he cared about the students (and know us by name) the most.  

When Willage opened, I was glad that he was still there.  Spice Trail was more similar to the kind of food he'd been serving before, but Local Chef allowed for more small talk.

Keep the GPA up and finish the required coursework and you'll be in. The in-state acceptance rate for transfers I believe is still over 50%.

comment,"Heck yeah. Quizzes are only 4% so at most you lost 1% of your final average. The best thing to do would be to start looking at patterns in how the matrices work. Like if you're asked how many pivot points in an `n x m` matrix, you realize that it is the smaller of the two numbers, since a) there are not enough rows for there to be a pivot in every column, or b) there are not enough columns for there to be a pivot in every row. Another example would be: to find the span of a matrix, row reduce it, and count up the columns that have pivots ‚Äì that's the answer because, think about it: row reduction bubbles the matrix down until it's just vectors indicating a possible position in the span. A system of equations that looks complicated just represents one of those subspaces, turned against the axes. When you row reduce, you are left with the subspace aligned with the x1..x2..xn space. So that number of pivots is how many dimensions on the skewed space you can actually access.

That aside, I think I remember having more success scheduling an appointment by talking to the front desk and having them put me through to the care team rather than pushing numbers as instructed.

You can apply while you are taking your final prereqs, so if you only need calc 2 for example, you could apply at the beginning of the semester that you start calc 2.

comment,"Hi! I'm a freshman in HP, and it was definitely a great decision for me.

Pros: You're generally with more motivated and intelligent students. Notice that I say generally, because some kids are still annoying as fuck.

Hefner and Armstrong are pretty good dorms imo. Much better than almost every dorm on east campus except towers and Glenn.

Its quieter, and generally better if you're not a party person/ into underage drinking. That being said, plenty of people still go and party on east campus every weekend.

You're very close to the CRC, which is an amazing gym and aquatics complex. (Theres also a large field and bbq grill near the dorms which are great for hanging out.)

Almost all my friends are part of HP. This is great if you have a hard time connecting with new people, but there is a group for everyone in HP, so you won't be left out.

West village is the dining hall. This is a mix between pro and con. The food comes in meals from mini restaurants. Sometimes I feel the quantity isn't enough, but 4 mealswipes a day saves the day. (Also starbucks counts as a meal swipe from 10 am to 1 am)

Pretty sure you get an extra academic advisor

*we have a ping pong table and piano*

Cons:
You are farther away from your classes, and most of campus in general. This isn't too big of a problem, but it definitely takes some effort if you want to go somewhere. That being said, sometimes I leave my dorm at 8 and come home at 6 because I'm studying in the culc.

There really isn't that much of an academic advantage tbh. You have early signup to some classes bc of HP. They are harder, but all your friends will be there.

I don't think the HP distinction at graduation means much. I probably won't get it bc I have few opportunities to take HP credit classes. You have to get 15 credit hours of hp classes to get the distinction when you graduate. But if you don't get the credits, they won't kick you out of the dorms and llc.

Tl;dr
Don't apply for HP if you want to fill your resume. Apply if you want a cool, very smart group of kids surrounding you. The real advantage of HP is the enhanced atmosphere of excellence that the people create. Also west campus isn't bad at all.

Dm me if you want more info about HP or tech. I'm OoS and honestly didn't want to come here, but I love it now.","Positive

One of my kids was in this exact situation, wanting to major in Economics, and when you look at it, State's Economic program is more highly ranked than Tech's. Plus, if you think you can get into Tech then you can probably easily get into State's Honors Program.  We visited down there and they have a compelling story of being downtown amongst all the multinational corporations, meaning world-class internships literally blocks from campus. And many grads that intern in Atlanta get post-graduation job offers from those companies for their locations all over the world.  GSU also has all the requisite study abroad programs including a couple that are Economics focused.

 (In case you're wondering my kid was accepted into the GSU Honors program but ended up getting a full-ride scholarship--I'm so proud and financially relieved--to an out of state, highly ranked economics school. So everything above is based on my research and GSU's sales pitch, not actual experience.)",Neutral,"education, transfer, economics, internships, study abroad, scholarships.",1,2019-09-04

If your thinking about unlocking the secrets of quantum computing, I'll stop you right there. The closest you'll get to actual research is probably talking to the ~~free labor~~ graduate students doing them.

Undergrad research is more dipping your toes into the reality of the field than anything more substantial. After all, you are an undergrad.

Getting a position is gonna be a bit harder. In NRE, a very small department, it was as simple as shotgunning every professor with an email and hoping one of them respond. Meet a couple professors, talk for a few hours, and show repeated interest. With a large department like CS, it might be more formalized.

But don't worry, there are plenty of openings. If the professor really tries, they can definitely find something for a undergrad to do.

comment,"I did my undergrad here, and am now doing my PhD. I did research as undergrad and obviously kept that up in PhD.

There's actually a lot of ways to get into undergrad research here. First, you can of course just ask professors/grad students what they're working on, and they'll usually tell you. Many projects can get funding for an undergrad because you're not expensive, so don't be afraid to ask! Pro tip, ask to talk to the PhD students, or attend talks they give/attend. There are many more PhD students than profs, and we're all doing research and generally like talking about it!

Second is Vertically Integrated Projects. They always involve undergrads, and the goal is for you to work on a team with a prof, grad students, and undergrad students. I did one and it was a good experience. The project wasn't the best fit for me but I still got some work done and got some experience, plus a letter of recommendation!

Third, I'd look into various CoC clubs based around topics you're interested in. They likely have competitions/projects that would be a good way to meet like minded people, plus create something you can show off later to get into your desired research program.",Positive,"undergrad research, phd, funding, networking.",2,2019-09-05

For part B, high availability doesn't work when an HA pair starts behaving in an unexpected manner but is otherwise up and running. We actually had major issues on two different distribution router pairs. This began with one distribution router having a dataplane malfunction, which then cascaded into a spanning tree reconvergence for hundreds of layer 2 networks which can eat up resources on other distribution routers. In this case our primary victim was a router that serves Tech Square and part of wireless, and its standby half rebooted. But the rebooting was a symptom of the issues we were seeing, not a cause, and we didn't wrap that up our troubleshooting until about 3:15 after isolating a couple of vlans' paths. Once that router was sorted out, we then revisited the original distribution router which was still down, and staff power cycled both units of that HA pair which restored normal service. 

So in short, we had a distribution router HA pair malfunction, and the resulting side effects were traffic related outages.",Neutral,"hardware, software, public forum, security, multi-vendor, cisco gear, campus distribution, high availability, unexpected behavior, dataplane malfunction, spanning tree reconvergence, layer 2 networks, resources, troubleshooting, vlans,",11,2019-09-05

Supposedly, all old vendors were invited to return if they agreed to some new sustainable goals were met (like getting rid of styrofoam containers), but some declined. They also decided to set a limit on the number of new vendors that could be present selling one type of food (a la coffee). Again, this is just what is present from that post.

They do care in the sense that if someone who does care finds someone on tech's network downloading their stuff and tells tech, tech will bitch at you about it.

So the question then becomes, can someone who does care find out what you're doing? It's easy with torrenting because your (tech's) IP becomes visible in the swarm just by nature of how the protocol works. So someone who does care can look at the swarm and see you downloading/uploading. They can trace the IP back to tech and tell them about it. They'll also send a letter asking for a few hundred bucks to make the problem disappear. Just ignore those. 

But with streaming\*, it's a lot harder for someone who cares to know if you are streaming their content. Because you're contected to the service that's hosting it directly, only they know your IP. It would be possible for the streaming service to be a honeypot where the party who cares is also hosting the service, but that's pretty rare (has it ever happened?).

&gt;A football team has four downs to make a first down (get ten yards), or else the ball turns over to the other team. The third down has been called the ‚Äúmoney down‚Äù because if the first down is not made, the offensive team usually elects to kick (either a punt or a field goal try) on fourth down. Third down is the ‚Äúmoney down‚Äù for both offense and defense.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúMoney down‚Äù became popular in the 1980s and 1990s, probably as a result of the popularity of the term [‚Äúmoney shot.‚Äù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_shot) ‚ÄúThird down is the money down in football, the down where both the offense and the defense play with their backs to the wall,‚Äù sportswriter Steve Duin stated in *The Oregonian* (Portland, OR) on November 3, 1985. ‚ÄúI want to be a good third-down quarterback.

3210-&gt; Lots of reading. Very similar to MSE 2001. Not hard just memorizing/prepping cheat sheets . Especially if you take varenberg.

comment,"Now that I've been on the other side recruiting for my company, one thing I haven't seen mentioned a lot is how important company info sessions/events are. You should always make an effort to attend info sessions and events for companies you're really interested in because: 

* You'll generally learn details about the company that are more in-depth than what a tired person talking to hundreds of other students at a career fair can give you

* Many companies will track your attendance at those events and use that as a (albeit smaller) factor in extending interviews/offers

* Even if the company doesn't do the above, it gives you a better opportunity to network with recruiters

* Related to the above, some companies will ask who stood out to the recruiters after the info session, which (besides being a boost to your application) could lead to exclusive recruiting events for star candidates

* Often times the people at those info sessions are also interviewers as well, which will give you brownie points if you get them for your interview and they remember you

For career fair advice, my response to an older post on what I did at career fairs:

* Smile and introduce myself (name, year, major) while shaking the recruiter's hand. Give them a copy of my resume and tell them that I'm looking for an internship/co-op/full-time position and what I'm interested in, then...

* Relate my interests to why I'm interested in their company. You don't need to do a ton of research on them, just have a general idea of what they do to express your interest.

That's all you can really guarantee for every encounter at a career fair. What happens next is open-ended depending on the company and the people. Most of the time after doing this, the recruiter will then go into a little spiel about their company and/or what positions they have available. Many recruiters might also look over your resume a bit and ask you about things that stick out to them. Some recruiters will ask you to tell them about yourself, which is when you would give them your elevator pitch.

What you do after the initial formalities are out of the way is really up to you. Most encounters I've had at career fairs have been fairly student-led rather than recruiter-led; it's not going to be like an interview where you're expected to sell yourself. This is mainly for you to ask questions and learn more about the company and the positions they have, as well as practicing your professional conversation skills in a low-risk setting while also getting your resume out there.

I liked to ask about the recruiter's background, what they do in their position, how long they've been with the company, what a typical day for them looks like, etc. One question that recruiters seemed to really like was asking them how their week was, and what sorts of things were they currently working on. These questions are a great opportunity to learn about what working at the company is actually like, which is something you can't really get from reading their corporate website.

You can also ask them about what they're looking for in candidates, what you can do to stand out, and ask for critiques on your resume.",Positive,"career fair, networking, recruiting, information sessions, elevator pitch, interview, resume, company culture, professional skills, candidate qualifications",22,2019-09-08

-Own a well-fitted suit and shirt, and make sure your tie and shoes actually go with the suit. This might get some downvotes but please get rid of those yellow GT ties.

-Be humble... this is a big one.

-Good hygiene makes you approachable. A little cologne/perfume goes a long way.

-Make sure you do some research about the company and what type of projects they do.

-Try to narrow your interests. Although it is great to hear candidates are open to try new things, we do like to see some kind of direction. ""I like everything"" can easily be interpreted as ""I really don't know anything"".

-This is a hard one for many people but confidence is key. Your resume might not be the best but attitude can compensate for that tremendously.

-I know its nerve-racking but try your best to stand still (not wobble around) and straight but relaxed enough to not look stiff. Also, speak up.

-Recruiters take just a few seconds to look at your resume before we speak to you. If there is something you think is worth mentioning, by all means mention it. We sometimes miss things.

-People love to talk about themselves and this is true for recruiters as well. Ask them about their job, what working at the company is like, their favorite or most challenging project, etc. Do this after you've introduced yourself and have spoken about what type of position you're looking for, interests, etc.

-This is kind of old school but if someone gave you their contact card it is always nice to write a follow up email the day after the career fair with your resume attached.

-Most importantly, have fun! Although things might not go as expected, use it as a learning experience for the next career fair.

comment,"While I am generally sympathetic to such ideas, it's not just a meme. It is a meme asserting a fact that I have strong reason to believe is false. That people who are ignorant of the meme's lack of veracity enjoyed it is irrelevant. And it's not an innocent joke either, it could have serious consequences.

Secondly, I do know how libel laws work. And as a favor to the OP I'll point out the following:

* Neither the Georgia Tech KA chapter/housing corp nor its members are public figures and could suffer actionable damages because of the post. In other words they'll have a much easier time suing.
* A reasonable person would understand the meme to say certain derogatory things (namely that KA is unwelcoming to minorities) that I believe are false
* If the author posted this based on solely on rumor/innuendo there's a good case to be made for negligence. Given that the OP has kept the post up after people have made comments that suggest the gist of the post is inaccurate there's a case to be made for recklessness/malice. The exact motivations behind posting could also support a case for malice.

TLDR, all the elements needed for a successful libel case are there. But legal or not legal is irrelevant. The right thing to do is take it down.",Negative,"legal, libel, ethics, responsibility.",-5,2019-09-08

The Klaus building has class and offices and it interferes with their duties. NOW I‚Äôm not saying that this is the reason the fair needs to move but may have been an outside factor.

Line control: Even with smaller companies and the fair being 4-5 days there are still lines that have to snake and that block walkways. If the fire marshal comes through and sees that, it‚Äôs an issue. It also makes it hard for people trying to simply walk through the career fair to specific companies very difficult.

I think that the COC career fair has simply put grown its space and has to many companies wanting to hire us (not bad lol). The move to Machamish is I think for the better since their is easier ways to snake the company lines.

While I will miss being able to easy scoot in and scoot out I won‚Äôt miss the lines that back up into other lines simply cause they have no where to go.

Get your resume critiqued by as many people as possible. 

Dont waste space on an objective statement, everyone's objective is to get a job. Also, keep your resume to one side of one page, no exceptions. 

Dont be afraid to brag a little about yourself and your accomplishments. Dont lay it on too thick, but if you just give generic answers to basic questions, it won't grab their attention.

However, from my personal experience, you'll find that UGA's class sizes are still substantially smaller than GT's. You'll also find more opportunities to meet and connect with your professor 1-on-1.

True, being in Atlanta might be an advantage, but you also need to factor in the quality of gsu's education. From what I've heard from my gsu friends and transfers, many of them disliked their time at gsu and felt like most of their learning came from the student orgs or at home. However, take my words with a grain of salt and ask the gsu subreddit for their opinion.","Neutral

I think there are a lot of factors that can make or break your experience: how far away do you plan on living, will you be walking/biking/driving/taking public transit to get here, what is your class schedule like, what does your social life look like, and do you mind coming in to campus for meeting and projects on the weekend. My biggest complaint, is that for driving, it can be difficult making it on time or getting home in a reasonable amount of time if you have classes that require you to drive during rush hour (7am-9am/4pm-7pm). Additionally if you drive you will have to deal with the joys of PTS and parking - it is usually good but during games &amp; events it gets hectic. Today is a great example, with the career fair permit holders were shifted all around campus to accommodate visitor parking. If you are very social it can be a bit of a deterrent unless you want to drive home very late at night or live with other friends from Tech. There are of course many pro's for commuting - cheaper rent, more space, more privacy, but there are also cons that vary from situation to situation.

What a load of BS. Many vendors sold out EVERY WEEK. Why couldn't they continue hold the market and then get feedback from those that attended??? Maybe send out a survey in Monday Mail so they can see what they can do to attract those that don't come?

comment,"It depends, if the scooter is abiding by the rules of the road, and you hit them, it's your fault. They are vehicles, and have the rights and responsibilities as such, just like bikes. You are required to give them 3 feet to pass, they have to stop for red lights, must enter the flow of traffic in a safe manner, and so on, just like anyone else on the road. Legally, aside from management of the scooters when idle, they are exactly like bikes. Neither scooters nor bikes are permitted on the sidewalks, but I've had far fewer incidents with bikes because they can go slower while remaining stable.

The problem is they are not bikes, they are harder to control, less visible, less front and rear to absorb impacts (The crumple zone of front and rear bicycle wheels are really underappreciated), when you classify things in your peripheral vision while driving, they look like pedestrians until it's too late. The tiny 3-4 inch tyres they have are highly susceptible to imperfections in the riding surface, and people loose control of them easily (this is a problem on sidewalks too, I've seen a scooter front wheel snap 90 degrees over uneven sidewalk seams, and face plant it's rider into a shrubbery).

My gut reaction is to ban them, but diversity in personal conveyance methods is a good thing, the best ""*Shareable Dockless Mobility Device""* that's come out recently, in my opinion, are the ""Wheels"", bigger tyers, better stability, I was disappointed when the Lyft bikes are being discontinued, but not the scooters, that's the opposite of what I want.",Neutral,"road safety, personal transportation, scooters, bicycles, pedestrians.

comment,"Yeah, and what you experienced is truly scary. I actually agree that scooters should eventually be moved onto the road. But we're **really** far from that point. Infrastructure isn't there to support it, and people will have an unreasonable chance of death because of poor governance.

But speaking from the numbers, you are totally off. I mean, just think of this logically. The amount of force and acceleration the car exerts on the scooter/rider is nothing compared to the force that a scooter exerts on a person. Yes, both situations suck. One happens to be much more deadly than the other. And this is me speaking as a pedestrian.

&gt; If you don't like the risk, don't ride the scooters, don't move your risk off onto me as a pedestrian.

We're speaking past each other here. First, we're talking about the general public here. Second, we're trying to come up with a solution that makes everyone safer, at least in the long-term. And last, I think we also want to solve the short-term problem of unprecedented death in Atlanta from vehicle-on-scooter collisions.

I want to focus on that last one a little bit. These deaths started occuring after a policy shift from APD where they started enforcing the rule of ""scooters only on the road."" Yes, there were injuries occuring before from scooter-on-pedestrian collisions, but nothing close to the death and injuries faced directly from this policy shift.

The solution is not banning them (scooters address a systemic transportation problem in American cities, the last mile problem), and neither is it mixing scooters with vehicle or pedestrian traffic. Both ignore the fundamental problem here. American cities, unlike cities in other OECD countries, are emaciated when it comes to transportation infrastructure. Amsterdam would have no issue with this problem, because it would never become a problem in the first place.

Really? You're calling me selfish because of a hypothetical justification I never gave?

And by the way, these scooters generally cap out at 15mph. Max I've seen them go is 20.

But ultimately, our disagreement here is about that transfer of risk. You're acting as if these risks are equal. If we're being real here, they're not.

I was earning that much cashiering back in Cali under Albertsons. I absolutely hated that job but the pay was a dollar fifty above minimum wage. Guaranteed 10 hours a week.

To be honest, we probably had that high of a pay due to a company wide ""mandatory"" union. They took 30 bucks in union dues every month though. 

We all grumbled about the union until they came around asking for authorization for striking (union deal for wages was going to be renegotiated) which we all happily jumped on. When I left for college, last I've heard was that 98% voted yes for an authorization to strike if no deal was made. Dont know what happened beyond that...

What was this about again? Oh right, unions. Yea, they're a great idea. Especially going on strike against the higherups. I personally havent joined in on one but from the very old ladies who've been working for decades plus, they're fun.

1. Cars are orders of magnitude more deadly than scooters

2. There has been a spike in scooter deaths by car in Atlanta recently

Most of them believe in the C average class, where professors will make a course harder to cause the mean of the class to end at a C+ish. They're intentially vague on what is taught, homework never appears on tests, and often come across as condensending/snorefests in lectures. Their GPAs are usually in the 2.5 - 2.6 range. A small minority however are just assholes.

In contrast, a good professor will establish course objectives and what students need to know by the end of the class. They'll grade students individually by knowledge on objectives, give homework that reflect tests, and the final is usually challenging but not surprising. Their GPAs are usually in the 3.2 - 3.3 range.

The latter are usually found in major specific classes. In NRE particularly, we're a small [shrinking :(] department so the professors are known personally and being an asshole is kinda rude. The department chair also teaches intro NRE as well and he's an amazing professor and person in general.

The former professors are found 99% of the time in massive lecture halls teaching 50+ students at a time. That's not to say there arent good professors teaching these mass lectures, I've had a physics 2 professor that was extremely enthusastic, made lectures interesting despite me already knowing the content, and had an amazing pass rate.

Many of ATL's traffic issues come from commuters going in/out of the perimeter. Besides the occasional random traffic jams on major highways/roads outside of rush hour, traffic has been pretty manageable on weekends/off hours in my experience, and you generally know which areas are worse than others.

LA has been chaos. Drivers are more aggressive with hard accelerations and sudden braking, which causes a lot of random backups. There's so much more random traffic during odd hours on random streets, not even the highways: 

* Going from Venice to Santa Monica (4 miles) at like 9-10am (technically after rush hour) can take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes depending on the day; I had one instance where it took almost 40.

* Going 7-8 miles from work to LAX at 2-3pm or 8-9pm on Wednesday/Thursday usually takes 45 minutes to an hour. Right now at 3:35pm EST, 9-10 miles from downtown ATL to Hartsfield-Jackson takes 14 minutes.",Negative,traffic,4,2019-09-10

I imagine most people finding a book (religious text or otherwise) left somewhere would assume it belongs to someone and not just take it. If anything, I would think they'd be taken to the lost and found.

This is especially true since nowadays physical Bibles most often hold sentimental value, no? There's no shortage of free ways to read any of the major English translations online, I would think. My first thought would be that that particular copy meant something significant to someone.

If I found a physical Bible (or any book, really) lying around on campus, I'd either leave it for the owner to come back for or turn it in to the lost and found, even if I were interested in the religion. Taking it would feel like stealing.

Some things have non-zero rest mass (and therefore rest energy) and you can mc^2 them, but don't have any volume at all. These things are not matter. The equation does not tell you this.

comment,"So for everyone down voting me... What are you going to do in the real world after college?  

Also, before you says I ""don't understand"" let me just explain my background... I went to GT from 2000-2003. During that time I was just as stressed out as everyone else but I also had the added stress of working to pay my way through school because I wanted to avoid student loans. I also experienced 9/11 and had the misfortune of losing one of my best friends, as well as losing an uncle I was very close to. Since school I have lost several family members, lost a job, almost lost my house, worked for a manager that I absolutely hated, got separated, and eventually got divorced from a very toxic person.

The key take away is that I didn't expect someone else to fix my problems. I saw counselors and doctors during this time, but it was because I took care of it. You have to take ownership of your problems and realize that things will be better tomorrow. Also, stop focusing on the negative shit and realize that even bad situations are an opportunity to make things better. Above all, find something that you are passionate about outside of school and use it to build your happiness.

Not because you are a genius ( again not directed toward you just my inflated ego at the time). keep that in mind when you feel under-worked. You should be trying to learn new skills, gain the knowledge needed of you to gain more work, and build relations with people at your work place ( You will need this for letters of recommendations). Speak with your manager on things that interest you and see if they can work you in on those projects.

However, to answer the question directly:

&gt;Has anyone on here ever done 1 semester of a co-op and not continued, mostly because they didn‚Äôt like what they were doing, felt underworked, etc?

First off, I love the co-op program. I did a repeat internship before I went into the co-op, so I knew the benefits of doing a co-op. At least for CS, the first two months are getting familiar with the tooling and team standards. Then the last month is spent off-boarding. Co-ops let you experience more of the everyday routine you would get in your job (Internships vs. Co-op is an entirely different discussion...).  

However, the company I co-oped for wasn't the right fit for me. They were super laid back, had a good amount of bureaucracy, and hadn't really experienced growth... ever. I thrive in a competitive workplace, and would gladly be overwhelmed than underwhelmed. I quit after a month and went back to my summer internship place.  

I talked to the CoC and C2D2, and apparently they knew the company by name... Lots of co-ops had dropped before completing.  

I didn't suffer any adverse consequences, other than some insignificant transcript things (was marked that I failed my co-op).   

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, I wouldn't recommend going into a co-op with that mentality. It's unfair. The company spends time and money training you, only for you to leave before you start contributing back. Granted, don't suffer in your co-op. If you find out that you don't like it, it's bad to BOTH parties for you to continue.

I think that what these other people fail to understand that what they feel is apathy towards queer folks is actually alienation.

comment,"Materially there is less support than there should be. There is an extremely loving and open queer community on campus and there are people of all sexualities and gender identities represented on campus. The problem goes a bit deeper, to who controls tech and the overall politics of tech. 

1. As a public university in Georgia, tech is controlled by the boards of regents. The board of regents is appointed by the governor, and Georgia's governor is nearly always a conservative cishet white man. The appointees usually reflect the person appointing them, with token exceptions. This makes large scale school policy that would better support queer students extremely hard to implement. 

2. The second aspect is the overall political climate of the student body. Tech is much more conservative or politically apathetic than the average university. I'll break this down even more.

a. Much of the funding at tech (and especially the GTRI) comes from oil and defense/military, due to what disciplines tech focuses on. The student body reflects these sources and often comes to tech to specifically to go into these fields. People with a desire to go into these areas are, typically, more conservative. 
b. Tech's majors typically result in high paying jobs immediately. In fact, tech advertises this fact heavily, attracting students who come here explicitly to quickly make a ton of money when they enter the work force. (There is nothing wrong with that and I do not mean to malign anyone with that desire, it's understandable). These are the ""fiscally conservative"" types, and more often than not that also means they are socially conservative. 
c. Tech is a tech school. We have a great liberal arts college and no matter the major students have to take liberal arts classes. However, the fact that the majority of students take few liberal arts classes, where engaging in civil discourse, considering other view points, and carefully structuring arguments, does mean that these skills are less valued at tech, which hinders open dialogue and an exchange of ideas. (I also want to say here I don't mean to malign engineers and I know I'm speaking in generalizations - I know engineers who are way more skilled at all of the above mentioned skills than most liberal arts students.)
c. Because we're a tech school, students often have the misconception that tech work occurs in a bubble and they need not busy themselves with superfluous things like politics. This leads to larger political apathy. 

DISCLAIMER: I know I am speaking in generalizations. My intentions with those are not to provoke or even open a conversation but to provide insight. No one factor leads to this and each factor itself is fairly small. But all together they create the environment you've heard about. Don't avoid coming to tech because of this. There are tons of openly queer people here with so much love to give you. But know what you could be coming into.

Also try to reward yourself for the things you‚Äôre doing everyday, whether it‚Äôs getting takeout from your favorite place when you get through a round of midterms or saying you‚Äôll go somewhere with friends to reward yourself for applying to X number of jobs. Try to focus on all the things you‚Äôre doing right and reward yourself when you can. Honestly you‚Äôve made it to your senior year at tech so you should already be super proud of yourself and you just have a little more to go before you get out.

comment,"You're suggesting that someone you disagree with needs counseling because they're a ""bad person""

You're drawing a line between your perception of his low value and how that means he needs counseling. Which is implying that therapy should only be for people who aren't as good as you. 

To address your last comment, just because someone does not agree with your position on the solution to an issue does not mean they do not ""empathize"" with those in that situation. I'm sure that /u/MBPyro feels bad for people who want to hurt themselves ‚Äì¬†perhaps he simply thinks that if they can't stand the rigors of Georgia Tech, then perhaps they're trying to make themselves fit into something that just isn't for them. Perhaps he believes that it isn't up to Georgia Tech to change itself to fit them, when the only healthy solution is the same in any unhealthy relationship ‚Äì¬†separation.

comment,"&gt; who has made clear they don‚Äôt care about lgbtq or racial minority issues

I wasn't aware that was part of the discussion. That hardly speaks to a lack of empathy, simply, it speaks to a different outlook on life and different priorities than yourself. You should seek to understand where he comes from rather than writing it off wholesale, as you are currently doing. Doesn't that intimate a lack of empathy on your end? Or do you think that being empathetic is something you should only do for those who agree with you? 




&gt; completely strawman what I say when I‚Äôm in support of people getting help

You and I both know you said what you said from a place of derision and scorn. Own up to it and resolve to be part of the solution by not making derisive comments about mental health in the future. 

&gt;you need to grow up

I'm not the one demanding that Georgia Tech be my mommy. You're responsible for your own mental health and happiness, and if you need to leave this school to maintain it, we shouldn't stigmatize you for that. We don't owe people free treatment, but we also shouldn't think of them as lesser for coming to the realization that Tech isn't for them.

comment,"&gt; That maybe not going to tech might not be an option for people because of financial or other circumstances?

If people have a scholarship for GT, there are generally options to transfer that, particularly if they choose to transfer to a school within Georgia and they have HOPE. For what GT costs, **not** going here is almost always going to be an option from a financial standpoint. NOT going to college is by definition less financially taxing than going to college. Your math just doesn't conform to reality here. 

&gt;Not caring about other people‚Äôs issues doesn‚Äôt speak to empathy?

It's pretty clear to me that you haven't made any attempts to empathize with my viewpoint or MBPyro's. You've simply written us both off as ""inferior"". It will likely surprise you to find out that yes, I have been to counseling. It **has** helped me greatly, and it truly speaks to your deficit of empathy that you expect my outcome to be identical to yours. That speaks far more to your own inadequacies and feelings of insecurity than it does to mine. Not everyone is going to think the same as you do, and you need to learn to respect that, rather than narcissistically taking personal offense that people do not share your values and beliefs. 

You do not have a global monopoly on what it is to empathize with people. You are not the central authority who decides what is ""right"" and ""wrong"", despite your own clear self-centered belief that you should. 

Caring for your community does not mean relieving them of their responsibility for self-care. GT cannot fix you, only you can do that. GT can and should assist people in getting help, and it does, but actually providing them full counseling falls well outside its purview as a school. You are an adult, and as such, you are expected to act like any adult, caring for your own happiness and finding your own peace of mind ‚Äì¬†no one else will be able to do that, because no one else cares about you as much as you do.",Negative,"financial, scholarship, empathy, counseling, insecurity, responsibility, self-care, community, adult, happiness, peace of mind.",0,2019-09-12

https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/04/19/book-argues-faculty-members-should-actively-resist-culture-speed-modern-academe

‚ÄùWhile slowness has been celebrated in architecture, urban life and personal relations, it has not yet found its way into education,‚Äù reads Slow Professor: Challenging the Culture of Speed in the Academy (University of Toronto Press). ‚ÄúYet, if there is one sector of society which should be cultivating deep thought, it is academic teachers. Corporatization has compromised academic life and sped up the clock.

comment,"Throwaway for reasons that may become obvious.  You are receiving bad legal advice on this post.  Your statement is good warning, but there is no legal case here against GT and it's not because of the 180 day deadline. 

Student services on nearly every college campus (not just GT) pretend to be a bunch of things that they aren't.  The Peter Paquette example is a good one, but colleges trying to make up judicial proceedings in for rape cases when the people involved aren't even lawyers is not unique to GT.  There was even a statement from the Obama Department of Education asking non-lawyers in campus student service departments to get more serious about prosecuting sexual assault that is now resulting in a bunch of decisions being overturned because the evidence procedures didn't follow established rules at all.

The problem in this case is that the counseling center at GT is not a medical facility and when you signed the agreement allowing medical records to be transferred to them you specifically requested records to be transferred out of a HIPAA regulated entity (Ridgeview) into a non-regulated entity (GT).  I agree that it's stupid that the Counseling Center shared the records with people who are not counselors and have no medical training, but that's not a legal issue.  There are three types of entities that are covered by HIPAA: Insurance Companies, Health Service Companies that accept Insurance, and Health Data Clearing Houses.  The GT Counseling Center is none of those, so once you told the Health Service Company to transfer records no a non-covered entity the data became uncovered.

It is just rife for impostor syndrome - hell I know faculty deal with it just as much. Average at GT is outstanding as people have mentioned. But it's actually more than that. It is easy to see things we don't have that others do and hard to see the things that make us unique and valuable and important. 

On the first day of class I asked my first year students how many people had already had something happen that made them feel intimidated by there peers. Literally every single hand went up - literally. 

Honestly, I feel at times like the students are driving the competitive mindset as much as anyone else and I wish I had a way to shut it down. I've never met a student here who isn't incredibly capable and has the potential to change the world in some way.

comment,"I feel like people are trying to treat a symptom of a larger and broader issue when requesting new Georgia Tech mental health services. The main issue is that, for most students, the experience on campus is inadequate. Classes can be hard for no reason; the averages on tests can be in the 50s with the teacher being okay with that. Unnecessarily challenging classes cause a lot of mental burden on students. When students come back from their classes, what do they do? They try to take the campus bus that never shows up; they go to the dining halls which serve food of quality comparable to what's found in prison. When my own father came to my FASET, he told me the food they served to the parents was worse than the food served in the military; and, to be frank, the food they serve at FASET is supposed to be what they serve to impress the students and parents. Then, after students are done with their day, they return back to their GT Housing which, particularly for 1st-years in dorms, is quite sub-standard.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately though, I think there's something more underlying in the current generation of students too. We are driven to achieve without knowing why. We strive to work for the best companies, get the best grades, be leaders in all of our clubs. We believe that if you're not the cream of the crop, why be in the crop at all. Our generation of students is existentially impotent; we don't know what we're chasing or what we're trying to grasp. We only know that we have to achieve, and, from that, we are paralyzed. In a recent study, 86% of college students say they feel overwhelmed, 55% say they've had felt crippling anxiety, and 8% say they've considered committing suicide within the last 12 months. I don't know who or what to blame for this, but the truth is that this phenomenon of depressed, anxious, and overwhelmed students is happening across the country. Part of our generation's problem is that we don't know where we're going, and we should find a solution to that problem before it becomes any worse for us and for future students.",Negative,"mental health, georgia tech, generation, pressure, education",28,2019-09-13

If I understood you correctly that the dean of students office had access to your personality identifiable protected health information they most certainly breached HIPPA. HIPPA follows the minimum necessity rule and by no means did they need your health information. You have two avenues of reporting this breach of confidentiality. You can report this beach to the GA Tech HIPPA privacy officer at John.scuderi@health.gatech.edu. They have a legal obligation to investigate any claim of a potential HIPPA breach. If they try to sweep it under the rug, they expose themselves to grater fines up to $50,000 per incident and up to $1.5 million in fines for same nature breaches. The HIPPA privacy officer shouldn‚Äôt dismiss or ignore you. I would personally try this avenue first. Your second option is to report them directly to the department of health and human services and the office of civil rights. They will be forced to investigate the issue.  

In regards to the 180 day rule it‚Äôs flexible and not necessarily a complaint eliminator.

Besides, when you see a lot of students having interviews in C2D2, those interviews are mostly not coming from career fairs but from their applications on careerbuzz. So please don't get upset since there's no need to get upset about this at all!!!!

comment,"I never went to lectures past the first exam. For Rosbruck's exams, all you gotta do is read the powerpoints VERY carefully. Pay attention and study the texts, but also the pictures and statistics. She loves to put statistics questions on her exams. Study the guest lecturer's powerpoints. If you go to the guest lectures, she sometimes puts questions from there too (for example, there was this one guest who came into the lecture hall shouting ""GOOD AFTERNOON, SPORTS FANS"" and one of the exam questions was ""what did the guest lecturer called GT students?"" with choices: yellow jackets, georgia tech student, sports fans) 

Also, do the extra credits. I got a flat 90% in her class without the extra credits, but having that security meant I didn't have to study very hard for the third exam. Don't fret, it's an easy A if you put in a tiny bit of effort.","Positive

comment,So I've been apart of other colleges and seen how their day to day lives are in regards to school. All top schools are hard and stressful. Classes dont seem to make sense and prof always generally seem to make their students lives harder. The difference ive seen here is that students help each other out way more than other schools. Ive always been able to ask students for help and have it actually help me a lot rather than other schools where once someone figures stuff out they tend to make it a competition and hoard answers.,Positive,student life,4,2019-09-14

3. Game clock instead began (correctly) on the referee's signal, then dropped to 0:06 before GT called a timeout just as the ball was snapped, negating the game-winning touchdown.

Much of this game, the music would start on third down and decrease the energy in the stadium. Fans were confused. I watched football players confused as to why nobody was cheering on third down, and it's because the band wasn't playing.

The times that The Citadel decided to go for it on 4th down, the band did play. And it got the whole stadium on their feet every time. It works. In the past I've seen the band playing on third down actually disrupt the other team enough that they had to take a timeout. That's not something the PA system can ever do.

This isn't the first time someone has decided to tell the band not to play on third down, and it always has the same result: the game experience gets worse. I really hope whoever made this decision changes their mind before the next game, cause the stadium PA music is really just sapping the life out of the crowd.

That said, it's certainly not too late. In fact, I'd venture to say it's never too late to make friends in college (other than the month before you graduate, perhaps)! While there are certainly elements of that (frankly childish) view of initial social groups as immutable among certain people here, the vast majority are open to making new friends anytime :)

If you're in a dorm, try to get together with some of the people on your hall. There's a good chance there are at least a few people there in a class with you (maybe not the same section, but perhaps a lab course with shared assignments/exams); ask if anyone would like to form a study group. You're probably in classes with a bunch of other freshmen; talk to them before/after class.

Clubs are a great way to meet people who share interests with you! While the org fairs for this fall have already happened, most clubs I know are almost always welcoming new members anytime!

comment,"NEUR 2001 is definitely a difficult class, especially for first year students, because it demands autonomy and independence. You mention that you fly through info in class and info is treated as review material‚Äîthat is unfortunately the case for courses as content-heavy as NEUR 2001. There simply isn't enough time in lecture to cover everything you need to know. **Success in the course is only attainable if you understand that you will be self-studying and learning a lot of the information on your own.** It's an unfortunate reality :(

So, resources... Your textbook is your best friend. Even if the professors don't reference pages in the textbook, there is some chapter that covers \*nearly\* everything that you'll cover in lecture. It is your responsibility to find this info on your own and look into it. By the time the semester ended, I had read virtually the whole textbook even though it wasn't what we were directed to do. Primary research is also your best friend. A lot of times, your professors are going to cover relatively new concepts and ideas. They might not be in your textbook yet, but there will be mention of them in various research journals. You will have to get comfortable looking through multiple high-level articles and sources on your own, unfortunately. You're correct that there isn't any one reliable place to learn the content‚Äîyou'll have to continually search the internet for the appropriate source.

Most importantly, though, make the time to go to office hours. NEUR 2001 has multiple professors, multiple lecture TAs, and multiple lab TAs. There is a very good chance you will be able to attend somebody's office hours. If not, email somebody to set up a separate time to do so. A lot of the content in the course is also presented in a way that is completely original to Tech; our professors have come up with certain models on their own (the IMIOF model, for example). You will never be able to find this info anywhere but from your professors, so you have to make time to see them.

I've helped a lot of folks with this course, and I promise you, 99% of the info is out there somewhere. That somewhere isn't necessarily widely advertised or easily accessible, but it's out there. Best of luck, my friend.",Neutral,"education, self-study, resources, office hours",2,2019-09-14

Anything that \*seemed\* low yield at first glance was really just an extension of a high yield concept or some situation that was new but easy to answer/analyze by applying high yield concepts. Usually, concepts that were heavily covered in lecture (at least 3-5 slides on the topic) made up the bulk of the exam. Do you have any examples of low yield content that was assessed on your first exam?

I'm a bit OOTL here.   
The GTAA is **mandating** that the band can't play on third down **AND** students can't stand in the South End Zone?!?!?   

I'm an alumnus (EnvE 12/13), not a current student, but, if true, this is an affront to ALL OF US.   

I was sitting in my (cheap) season tickets in Upper North today alongside alumni ranging back to the 60s all the way to fairly recent grads like myself and a couple current students.    
We were all talking about how subdued the crowd, and particularly the students seemed.  
Especially the emptiness and lack of energy in the South End Zone (product on the field didn't help that today).     
TBH, I was kind of upset at the current students for the apparent poor attendance and lack of enthusiasm. BUT it sounds like it may not really be the students' fault.    
 If y'all can confirm this is GTAA's doing (preferably in the form of an email and/or maybe video of folks being told to sit), I will get that circulating amongst fellow alumni that care about this (including some donors) as best I can.   

Collins and (I thought) Stansbury are trying to improve on fan culture, but this seemingly flies directly in the freaking face of that.

comment,"The band adds so much to third down.  I actually have my seats closer to the band to enjoy that aspect of the game.   


Having said that I must say that the money down thing isn't going over well.  I sit next to the player family section...they think it's dumb, everyone around me thinks it's dumb, obviously the PA announcer is torn and vacillates to it only when apparently forced.  Now hearing that the band is being limited on third down makes me wonder if the new coach is more focused on his band ""Playlist"" during the game or actually coaching and winning against a lesser opponent.  I get we are trying to change the culture some here but we're at game three and it looks like we are trying to be a cheap knock-off of Miami....I'm not good with that.  Taunting the other team's players who are actually out-playing you with less talent isn't smart.  Hyping ""money down"" when a FCS school is running all over you on the field isn't adding anything to the fan experience or getting us more involved.  What gets us more involved is well played football and showing respect to your opponent on the field. Making up for what we lack in talent with intelligence and seamless execution. I get it's a complete retool to a new offense with the wrong players.  I'm not saying anything about poor execution in a new system or on the field.  But crappy penalties and lack of focus against a team you obviously thought you deserved a victory from is not advancing the new culture, instilling a belief in the fan base that the coach can change things, or generating hype to add to that fan base from the local Atlanta area.  

&amp;#x200B;

In the off-season, all the fun videos form Waffle House were cool, and all the player-centric trappings let me know that he connects with young kids and get them to come here and play.  But ultimately he is here to win and instill a belief in our athletes and fan base that Georgia Tech can be a major player in Div 1 football and compete against the big boys.  I really didn't see any of that yesterday for the entire game. I saw a team out coached, out played, and even when they had a chance to win, make poor decisions.  I'm not expecting anything more than 3 wins this year and I hope the kids stay resilient if the season goes that direction.  I was at Ma Tech for the last Glory years 89-94 so I know what is possible with the right staff and players.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this turned into a rant

comment,"Hey! I‚Äôm a guy that started noticing my hair fall excessively since senior year of high school (i am currently a 4th year). I wasn‚Äôt very stressed back in high school, especially the last semester of senior year. Ever since then, I‚Äôve been going through the various stages of hair loss and now my temples are definitely patchy and my hairline has aged me. Personally, I feel like GT has accelerated my hair loss but I dont think it is the cause of hair loss. I‚Äôve tried everything except prescription drugs and surgery.  It took me many years to cope with it but the use of hats, hair fibers, and talking to trusted friends about it has definitely helped me out immensely. Soon I‚Äôm gonna decide to throw a bald party where all my friends are gonna help me shave all my hair off. 

Just accept it how it is and try to use tools available (hair style, hair fibers, buzz cut) to improve what you have or eliminate the problem by shaving everything.

So the competence is something delicate though. Companies look for brilliance, of course, but if you have soft skills, you will be more attractive to companies, as the competence will come as you grow with them. Social skills cannot be taught in the same way, and a proper workplace will want someone that can properly communicate. See if this is a strength you hold and how you can lift it in your CV in combination with your competence.
Stop comparing yourself to the others, (cause omg.. People are crazy smart here.) and only try to focus on competing against your past self, to become a better future self.
Maybe... Maybe this isnt what your passion is in. I used to work as a web developer, ad I found myself in your position, i felt stupid for asking, imposing, because everyone else just seemed to know things instantly. I couldnt keep at their pace until I found my passion, switching fields. Suddenly learning and working was... Worth it?
But talking to you about new ways to think (stop comparing to others, whats your passion, etc..) is something I know will sound silly to you. I also suffer from anxiety, and when people talk to me this way I think: ""yeah, right"". But I ask of you to at least try and re-wire the thinking of your value. You're here. You're you not them.

Granted, you‚Äôre in the city of Atlanta, not a suburb college town, and there are certainly places within walking distance of campus that can be sketchy at night. GTPD does a great job and I‚Äôve never felt unsafe on campus


2. The food itself isn‚Äôt bad, the problem is it‚Äôs not worth what you‚Äôll be paying for it on the required freshman meal plan. Most upperclassmen use dining dollars for on-campus restaurants and take the time to easy into cooking as an adult. You‚Äôre in Atlanta, so there‚Äôs plenty of good food options around.


3. I‚Äôve heard that Computer Engineering and Biomedical Engineering lose out since they‚Äôre ‚Äúin between‚Äù majors, but everyone has their own experience and GT is somewhat accommodating with changing majors (though you might have to put in a couple semesters extra)

4. You‚Äôll likely feel like everyone in your classes was the valedictorian of their high school. There are also a ton of difficult courses. But the challenge at Tech is really what you make it (ie. don‚Äôt take 20 hours and expect to get a 4.0)


5. Honestly, that everyone‚Äôs a big nerd. For both.

7. Georgia Tech is an ACC school. Take of that what you will. If you‚Äôre looking for the full college gameday experience, you‚Äôll find it. If you aren‚Äôt, stay in your dorm on Saturdays.

1. GTPD does a good job keeping campus safe. That being said, there have already been a few minor robberies. I generally don't feel unsafe at night.

  


2. There are good resteraunts right off campus. I'm currently a freshman on the every day meal plan, and I'd call the dining hall solid 3/5 star food. It's tolerable, but I'm already getting tired of it.

3. Haven't taken any major specific classes yet

4. I was in my class's top 10. I feel challenged here, but can't really give you a good answer cause it's only been like 4 weeks.

5. My favorite spot on campus is Couch Park (big field on campus). It's never crowded, but people play various sports there, and you can see skyscrapers over the trees. I also like people watching on the south side of tech green. I don't like the lack of individual study space in public buildings like the CULC.

6. I'm in state, but if you're from the north, you'll probably have a rough time adjusting to the heat, especially walking between classes.

7. People like football, but no one goes to Tech for the football like they would for Alabama or uGA. However, this means that you can get tickets for football games easier.

8. People tend toward antisocial, but mostly because everyone seems to be doing their own thing.

9. 10% chance. Good luck on your application dude!",Neutral,"university life, campus safety, dining, academics, campus spaces, social life, adjusting, football, social dynamics, admissions.",1,2019-09-15

The labs are based on participation. Any less than 100% on the lab (they drop 1 lab at the end of the semester) portion of your grade is shameful. Go to labs. Enjoy them because actual labs are suffering. Be apprecative of your TAs. They at least know what's going on and how to fix the problems that pop up. Actual labs have both student and TAs scratching their heads, shrugging, then writing it down as device error. Only to have the grader (often the same TAs) mark it down as incorrect because they're assholes.

The lab coding is fairly simple and brushing up on basic python code will be all you need to complete the course. Focus more on energy equations (e.g. GPE = mgh and KE = 1/2 mv\^2) which can easily be translated to code on a test (E_G = m * 9.81 * h and E_K = m * v ** 2 / 2).

but most TAs dont want to be TAs. the uni im at, is part of the requirements for pursuing a phd.

many TA positions dont get paid (other than our phD stipend, though some do.) and we have to grade a bunch of shit. while doing what really matters to us, which is our research, which is endless. i think only the phd candidates that have a desire to become a professor and have a passion for teaching really want to be in that TA position.

comment,"So the problem is that they can't have a subjective requirement. The idea is that subjective requirements unequivocally lead to discrimination, and courts have mostly upheld this in civil actions. So they have to use an recognized objective requirement, which leaves them with the TOEFL or I think one other choice. They use the TOEFL, and I guess it doesn't work perfectly, which is probably to be expected with any such ""objective"" measure. Of course, they have to err on the side of too relaxed rather than too discriminatory, because only the latter puts them at risk of legal action.

tl:dr They have a requirement, it's a low/easily-manipulated bar, but it reduces their potential legal liability.","Neutral

comment,"Really the core issue though is that there is already a supply problem for TAs. I am a \[old\] graduate student, native English speaker, I have TA'ed 11 semesters over my life (started early in undergrad) and not once have I gone into a semester where the professor found it easy to get enough competent TAs. There simply are not enough graduate students who are both competent in the language and the material. I won't pretend like I have a solution to this problem; I'm sure some of it boils down to the institutional pressures of professor to focus on research instead of teaching. But one thing that can help is y'all.

comment,"As a graduate TA myself, the process is also entirely dependent on the teacher selecting the right people as well. At least for CoC, a survey is sent out which prospective TAs select which classes they want to TA for, then ultimately the teacher decides from a list of candidates. Depending on the class, teachers could be hard pressed to find people to fill the roles. Being a TA is also required for PhD candidates I believe, and usually you don't know if you have any say if you want to be a ""teacher TA"" or a ""grading TA"".

My first-order take is that this subreddit will disproportionally highlights negative aspects of the school (versus my experience here since 2015 and talking with others).  There are definitely aspects where GT can provide more mental health support or improve overall quality of life - big things like dining cost, smaller things like properly staffing the housing maintenance staff.  

That said, the overwhelming majority of people I‚Äôve talked to have been extremely glad that they went to / are at Tech.  It‚Äôs also probably true that those people would‚Äôve said the same thing had they gone to their other options, but it speaks some to how much people like Tech.  Tech has been great for me in terms of advancing career opportunities and connecting me with some great and (hopefully) lifelong friends.  

So to summarize, GT has things to work on but overall I think the student experience is good here.  Just my experience.  Main differences to other similar schools might be student body demographics (the ‚Äúratio‚Äù, a very STEM-focused student body, moderate diversity for STEM schools), location (not a college town, but lots to do in ATL), and culture (‚ÄúMIT of the south‚Äù but not Ivy-type culture imo, public school)",Neutral,"school experience, mental health, career opportunities, student demographics, location, culture",2,2019-09-17

comment,"For what it's worth, I'm in IAC, and this is a major problem that we're seeing and trying to study, and not just for undergrads. Not being able to communicate well in English contributes to some serious mental health outcomes for international grad students. Undergrads tend to be harsher than even OP in their evaluations of international TAs and grads, and that takes a toll. Plus, feeling out of place when you want to succeed and help students just isn't great for your mental health when it's 2 to 7 years of that.

Something else y'all might want to know: the TOEFL requirement to get here is really low, but there's no actual resources for getting help with English for grad students. There's a for-profit agency that helps with writing, but it's super expensive and inaccessible. Even if your TA wants to remedy this, OP, they likely have no structured resources with which to do so. The writing center just hired someone for a pilot program to help with this, though, so if you're an international grad needing help with your English, go see Rob Griffin in the comm lab in Clough!

My point in all this is that you have a right to be upset, but please look at this as GT failing, not your grad student TAs failing.

Classes were somewhat harder than Tech.  Note taking there relies on printing out unfinished slides before class and filling in the spaces with the professor's version.  Course credit transfers but not letter grade, so Al's long as you make at least a C it won't matter how you did for your GT GPA (double check this with the registrar did, since courses count as transfer credit).  Make sure the GT registrar handled your transfers and equivalencies correctly.  Also, I heard that schools abroad really don't like giving abroad students Fs or Ds, so C may be the effective minimum.  You probably won't get the most convenient class times and you may not get all the classes you asked for.

Definitely go for the introductory programs for abroad students, a great way to meet other friends to make your time enjoyable and less lonely.

I would recommend not staying at the Prince George's Park Residences dorm at NUS unless you can get air conditioning.  I was placed on the first floor and regret not getting air conditioning.  There was a severe trash problem on the 1st floor, and a cockroach infestation.  PGPR is close to an MRT metro station though and that helps immensely with transportation in the city.

NUS's location is nice because it has an MRT station and relatively close to the city center.  I haven't been to NTU, but I believe you have to take a bus to an MRT station, and it's quite a bit farther than NUS to city center.

I think Tech attracts students with a hunger and aptitude for success, but this very characteristic is what drives some of us towards unhappiness at various points in our lives. Let me explain. If you are happy with where you are in life, you wouldn't struggle to achieve more. You have an instinct that things can be better and you're going to spend ungodly amounts of time chasing that, even if you aren't convinced you'll find it. Eventually, you'll realize that you have achieved a level of success that you had dreamed about in the past but the hunger will still remain. It will push you towards perpetual dissatisfaction. 



I believe the purpose of life to is to enjoy. I'm not religious nor do I believe we are here for some higher purpose of human progress. In order to break from the pain of the hunger mentality, you must understand and fully commit to the idea that we are at Tech to find a career that will **support** the lifestyle that makes you happy.  

Get a job near the people you care about with a big enough salary to fund an interesting life. If you spend your life trying to be successful, there will be no time left to enjoy it.

Luckily, this is a youthful concern. Eventually, you'll have kids and your whole life will revolve around pressuring them into the same bullshit.

comment,"If you're dead set on working with electronics, EE/CompE is a pretty safe bet. As other commenters have said, plenty of aerospace companies hire from those majors, especially for avionics, satellites, and space payloads. 

On the other hand, it IS possible to get into many of those same fields from the AE side, since AE is basically a weird hybrid of mechanical and electrical engineering. However, everyone I know who's done it has done a lot of research or personal projects to learn about electronics, because they're not taught in depth in the AE curriculum. There was an avionics course offered last fall, but that was pretty surface-level and I'm not sure when it's being taught again. There are also some other AE courses on ECE-ish topics like autonomy and controls, which you might find to be topics of interest as you go through college--but you can just as easily take classes on those topics through the ECE school.

It sounds like your ideas about switching to ECE and either minoring in AE or doing research in AE would give you the best of both worlds. Another idea would be to stay in AE long enough to take AE 1601 (Intro to AE) and see if any topics from that class pique your interest. Feel free to PM me if you want to hear more from the perspective of an AE (who maybe should have been in ECE all along).",Neutral,"engineering, aerospace, avionics, satellites, space payloads, research, personal projects, electronics, curriculum, avionics course, ece, autonomy, controls, minoring, ae 1601, perspective.",3,2019-09-17

comment,"That's useful information! I currently think I've narrowed it down to EE or CompE, but I definitely don't have experience with circuit card assemblies or program FPGAs to decide between the two. 

What I do know: I have worked in a telecommunications lab on a technician level, and enjoyed working with the racked devices. That might be because I like hands-on stuff though. I'm not interested in transmission of power or substations. Also, my MATLAB class is kind of frustrating but I am starting to enjoy it. I am totally dead set on working in the space industry.

How did you chose CompE over EE (or CS)? Do you feel like your CompE degree is serving you well in avionics? Are you working in the space industry, commercial airlines, or something else? What did you do as a CompE to get a foot into the aerospace industry - something like research, a couple classes, joining an extracurricular like rocketry club, or something else?",Neutral,"education, career, decision-making, space industry, aerospace, engineering, telecommunications, technician, matlab, avionics, compe, ee, cs, power transmission, substations, commercial airlines, research, extracurricular activities, rocketry club",1,2019-09-18
comment,"I work at a big defense contractor. I started out working on communications equipment, and one day the opportunity to switch over to avionics just fell in my lap. I was actually getting ready to move to another giant defense contractor to work on avionics for them, and a better opportunity presented itself at my current company, so I stayed. Actually I've had two opportunities to work on avionics at two other companies, and I had a coworker leave recently to go work at SpaceX. A SpaceX recruiter also reached out to me on LinkedIn, which was exciting, but F California. Honestly all I did to get my foot in the door was to be a computer engineer working on embedded software. Thats the exact skill set you need to work in avionics. Assuming you want to work on the software part. I can't speak as much to the other aspects.

comment,"I'm an LMC major. I'll graduate in December with Communication and Literature as my threads. I think the workload is dependent on the threads, how you distribute your major courses, and how many hours you take. Many LMC professors are out of touch with reality and assign ungodly amounts (given 4 days to read a 1200 page book) of reading. But if you have a good mix of core curriculum courses and major courses, you can balance the reading load. 

Prospects also are highly dependent on your threads, though I'm sure any combination of threads can lead to good prospects if you work hard enough at figuring out your marketable skills and building a portfolio. I am going to pursue technical writing once I graduate.

As for threads:

STAC classes are very interesting but basically literature courses. Dr. Crawford is fascinating.

Literature is self-explanatory. I loved taking science fiction courses with Dr. Yaszek. 

Communication seems to be very practical. A lot of the comm classes focus on business and technical writing-- both of which are useful in every field. 

I've never taken any of the Social Justice classes. I think the film production class I took is considered a part of the Media thread, but don't quote me on that. It satisfies a comm thread requirement for me.

Edit: I want to be clear - I'm not saying that the scooters should be on sidewalks or that it's your fault for hitting them when they are somewhere they aren't supposed to be.
My view is high speed/bigger/safer transit should yield to the safety of low speed/smaller/squishy transit.
So cars yield for bicycles/scooters yield for pedestrians.
So if a scooter rider is illegally on the sidewalk, just lose your 2 seconds of time and let them go. If you get in an accident they are probably going to get seriously injured whereas your car will just get a dent.

My favorite thing about the major is how customizable it. People in the major want to be lawyers, teachers, writers, graphic designers, etc. 

While that is really great, it can also make picking classes overwhelming as a first year because you have so many choices. I‚Äôd recommend going to talk to Jillann Hertel in your first semester. She‚Äôs the LMC career advisor so she can help you figure out what you want to do and that will help you pick classes. 

But really, most LMC classes I‚Äôve taken have been great. There can be a whole lot of reading if you take a lot of lit or social justice classes together.

I‚Äôd recommend spacing out your core classes so you take 2-3 major classes most semesters and 1-2 core or minor classes. It helps break up all the reading and writing. 

As for professors, Dr. Morris and Dr. Farooq are two of my favorites in social justice.

I will say make sure that you‚Äôre not just considering how good the classes are, and be sure to study some non-engineering electives. By far the best aspect of being in Singapore is being able to travel around SEA and spending time with other exchange students.

comment,"The crowd conformity that goes on with these can be particularly frustrating.     
In my experience, only ~30% of drivers treat the flashing red as a stop sign when they pull up to them *alone* and no one is crossing (assuming multiple lanes in each direction here).     
However, that number drops to about 5% if at least **one** driver in another lane is treating it like a solid red light.   
Unfortunately, this phenomenon isn't totally symmetrical.  If multiple parallel drivers correctly treat the flashing red crosswalk lights as a stop sign, it seems like ~20% still stop until no lights are on, sometimes eventually blocking all lanes.     
This crowd behavior is nearly identical to Georgia drivers encountering a stopped school bus going the opposite direction on a divided highway with a built-up median.     

I'm pretty sure it's a mix of drivers that have zero clue about basic driving laws and drivers who doubt themselves and look to others for guidance on what is legal.      
What's extra maddening is that DOT seems to have anticipated this and placed very clear signage with instructions telling drivers what to do, yet they still ignore them.

comment,"EC's are not about proving your readiness for a certain major. This is what a lot of high school students don't seem to understand. Your academics do that. Admissions looks at your EC's to see what makes you tick as a person. Tech wants a student body with a more diverse mix of interests and experience than just being exclusively into STEM stuff. Kids whose EC's are in art, or jazz, or beekeeping, or parachuting, or kayaking, or their own business or charity, or whatever are of just as much, or often more, interest to admissions. The point of considering EC's in admissions, besides proving that you can be involved in something outside of classes and still be an excellent student, is to demonstrate your inquisitiveness, passion, and motivation as a personal characteristic. Plenty of kids do get in with only STEM EC's if they can show a level of commitment and way of thinking that Tech believes will add to the mix here.

But apply to the major that you actually want. That way you can get involved in programs and organizations for the major early on and find out if it's really something you like. Join AIChE and go to the lunch and learns, get a peer mentor, etc. 

They won't reject you from ChBE because you did math or robotics extracurriculars. The vast majority of high school students don't even have the opportunity to do a chemical engineering related EC. I can't actually think of any; even Science Olympiad doesn't have any events that come to mind that are actually relevant to chemical engineering. I did sports, art, SWE stuff, and one year of Science Olympiad, and I got in for ChBE early.

I couldn't be bothered to spend $800 on a decent class laptop and also build a $1000 desktop plus $200+ for OS &amp; accessories all at once so that I could both continue school and still play games.

So I got an [Eluktronics](https://www.eluktronics.com/) laptop that was $1200 a little less than a year ago and I'm very happy with it. Gets good performance in modern games and isn't super heavy. My boyfriend has the newer model from about 6 months ago with the RTX 2060, 1440p display, and I believe a more recent Intel CPU gen than mine, and its performance rivals that of a desktop with a GTX 1070, for only $1500 and it's also very portable. Very useful for certain people who need to use software for class, work, or research that's CPU or GPU intensive. You wouldn't even need a desktop at all if you got one of the newer models with RTX cards and i7s.

The slides are on our website ([https://theoryclub.github.io/](https://theoryclub.github.io/)) and we have psets you can try too. We'll be having more proof based problem sets as the semester goes on. Here are some general tips:

* Always have a ""favorite example"" that you can test the validity of statements on. For example, what's a good non-trivial example of a singular matrix? A basis? A non diagonalizable matrix?
* Be comfortable with algebraic manipulation. Most proofs in introduction linear algebra fall out of a few lines of moving around variables.
* Understand the motivation behind definitions - for example, why is the determinant of a matrix an interesting number? If you can do this, you'll get a lot of intuition about the abstract framework as a whole.

But honestly, the best way to get better at proofs is to practice. If you read a lot of proofs and do as many problems as you can per day, you're almost guaranteed to get better. I absolutely love all things related to proofs and linear algebra, so feel free to PM me if you have more questions (I also have proof questions I would give my students when I taught 1554, if you're looking for practice)!

comment,"Depends on which off-campus housing you're talking about.

The nicer apartments right in Midtown are more expensive than on-campus (UH is currently slightly more expensive, SQ5 is significantly more expensive, for example). There are more options than just those two, though. Getting a place in Home Park, for instance, is far cheaper than on-campus.

The only added costs of off-campus housing aside from dealing with subleasing (which is admittedly a pain) is renter's insurance (cheap) and utilities (if they're not included in rent).",Neutral,"housing

comment,"Depends on where you live.

Some quick math I did:

North Ave = 4829/sem -&gt; year = 9658

A usual lease is 12mo -&gt; 9658/12 = ~804/mo if off-campus to be equal.

So if you‚Äôre paying less than 804 for rent and utilities it‚Äôs cheaper. Also keep in mind you‚Äôre paying for around 9 months or so with on-campus instead of 12.

If you add in the possibility of subleasing, you effectively are paying ~2-3 months less rent off-campus so:

9658/9 = ~1073/mo 

to be equal to the on-campus rate.

I think this is correct but could all be totally wrong as fair warning.

For reference my rent + utilities comes just shy of 600 a month so it‚Äôs roughly 7200 for the lease (year) without subleasing which is about $2400 cheaper.",Neutral,"housing, budget",10,2019-09-20

comment,"1. it's really not that bad. we recently had a string of incidents (like 2 or 3 i think?) where people's phones were snatched from their hands by some guy riding a bike, but that was more comical than anything. i'm a girl and i generally feel very safe on campus. i sometimes walk home from the library myself at night and there's usually no reason for concern. if it's really late though (like past 1am), or if there's alcohol involved, i would walk in groups.
2. bad. there's pretty much no variety in the food served and a lot of it is kinda janky looking and not trustworthy imo. it's also very difficult to eat healthy on campus bc there are very few healthy options and even the ""healthy"" options are not really that healthy (think: iceberg lettuce, white pasta ""salad,"" fried (as opposed to grilled/steamed) tofu, etc). west village (the new dining hall on west campus) has better quality food and more healthy options but it's still not great. i'm a vegetarian though so people who don't have dietary restrictions probably have an easier time with the dining halls. i will say, there are food trucks on campus everyday with really good food, but the lunches there are like $7-10 and you only have $100 dining dollars a semester on the freshman meal plan (which you're forced to buy).
3. i'm a freshman so i can't really speak to this. some good advice that i've heard from others is to make a 4 year plan of what classes you'll take each semester early on. for me this really helped because i realized i only need to take \~13 credit hours a semester to graduate on time, so i don't have to worry about overloading myself ""to stay on track."" (also pls pls study for your ap exams and get the credit, it makes things so much easier and you'll be able to take lighter semesters and focus on developing skills/participating in ECs, research, etc. outside of your classes. you're gonna think coming in that 12-14 credit hours sounds like nothing (so did i- lol), and you should be doing 17 because that's what it says on your major's website, but unless you have no AP credits then I would highly discourage this)
4. not trying to flex (this is a throwaway lol so there's no point) but for reference, i was salutatorian of my HS and got a 1570 on the SAT (didn't go to a prep class/ do prep before the week of the test). school is hard. i think a lot of freshman (especially OOS) have the attitude when they first get here of ""oh, maybe it's hard for everyone else, but not *me*, I'm smart!!"" you'll (not u personally lol just in general) very quickly get over yourself and realize that it's going to be difficult for you, too. that being said, it is manageable. if you don't go above 14 credit hours a semester, manage your time, and study ahead for exams, you'll be fine. just realize that it's not high school and you can't wait until the hour before an exam to start studying. 
5. favorite: cool people, super nice facilities, campus/amount of greenspace, size // least favorite: food, the fact that there's an application process for pretty much every club
6. i'm from NJ and i would say the weather. it's not too unpleasant though, and personally i really appreciate all the sunshine
7. football is big. we kinda suck but everyone still goes out to the tailgates and games (although a lot of people leave early) and has a good time. people aren't really emotionally invested in the team's successes/failures though (at least the people i've met) since we're not the best.
8. it's a pretty big school so you can't really generalize. there isn't a single ""type"" of student here, but i'd say people are generally happy (if a little stressed), despite how this sub makes things seem. no matter what your interests are, though, you'll find people here who are similar to you (and people who aren't that you can learn and grow from!!)

_TL;DR The eduroam network has a high level of security at the wireless network connection layer which mitigates most of the security concerns with public wireless networks. OIT doesn't generally care about individual users' network activity unless they're doing something malicious._

&gt;How secure is my data when connected to eduroam? It is as secure as any other public network?

When you connect to _eduroam_ both on Georgia Tech's campus and at other participating institutions, your wireless network connection is secured with WPA2 Enterprise security. This is far more secure than traditional public networks (such as free networks at Starbucks) that don't require a password to connect and have no connection-layer security of any kind. Anyone with the right equipment can sniff wireless traffic over the air on wireless networks that don't have any network-level security and potentially capture sensitive information without users ever knowing. Some of that threat is mitigated with the continual growth of website-level encryption, but that's not a universal given.

&gt;Should I be using a VPN service?

In general, using a reputable VPN service when connecting to public wireless networks is a good idea to avoid the issues I mentioned in the second part of my answer above. Tunneling traffic through a VPN adds a level of security that otherwise wouldn't be available to you on that network. Since eduroam already has encryption at the network level, it's not strictly necessary. If you do choose to, keep in mind that many campus web services are now being restricted to on-campus network users only and using a non-GT VPN would make you appear as off-campus.

&gt;What level of privacy does this data have from the prying eyes of network administrators?

One of the network administrators speaking, :). OIT has the same level of visibility into your network traffic as any other ISP (like Comcast, Spectrum, etc.) would. Generally speaking, we don't have any interest in the network traffic of individual users unless they're doing something malicious like participating in a botnet or have gotten themselves infected with malware. Our Cyber Security team also does some traffic analysis to address abuse complaints like copyright violations and similar actions.

&gt;What are the best practices for protecting sensitive data on eduroam?

As I mentioned above, WPA2 Enterprise provides a very high level of security already at the network connection level. You shouldn't need to do anything special on eduroam compared to a similar trusted network like that at your house.

There's a [detailed answer on StackOverflow](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/137606) about security with WPA2 Personal (PSK) and WPA2 Enterprise for anyone that would like more technical comparison and details.",Neutral,"security, network connection, data, privacy, vpn, best practices.",21,2019-09-21

There has never been a secret algorithm for getting into college, and most online undergraduate college admissions advice is voodoo that preys on anxious high school students. Just write a good essay that tells something visceral about who you are, and that's all you really have to worry about. The rest is out of your control and probably a bit random too. Don't exaggerate and make up things you didn't do, but also don't undersell the things that you worked hard on and cared about during high school.

comment,"I completely feel you. I felt this in previous semesters too but especially this semester, I feel like homework has been taking up so much time that it's not only preventing me from doing fun things, but it's literally hindering my performance and the amount of knowledge I learn in classes. I literally do not have time to study for the content and for exams in the way that works for me, and it's all because of the homework. It almost feels like I'm being treated like a high schooler since I'm being forced to study through homework rather than my own methods, which from my experience from previous semesters, allows me to get way more out of a class than homework.

To add on top of that, I really dislike homework since it implicitly forces perfection in a concept you only had a week or so of exposure of, which I feel is dumb and ridiculous. I find myself worrying about my grade more when doing homework than the actual concept since I know for a fact I need 2-3 weeks to learn something and I just want to get homework over with. This further makes homework almost a complete waste of time.

My solution for this comes from several of my dual enrollment classes and classes here at Tech that I've learned the most from. Make homework graded based off of completion, but still ""grade"" the homework in the sense of providing feedback for every problem. This way students are awarded for attempting the concepts instead of mastering the concepts. Students are also motivated to do homework properly since they will get the feedback they need to study. We can then use the time they saved from trying to perfect knowledge and skills within a week to study for concepts on the previous homeworks. In classes that use this model, I find myself learning way more and being much more prepared for future classes. Also, in my final semester of dual enrollment ALL of my STEM classes were like this. I find myself not only doing extremely well and learning so much that semester, but I actually had more free time to do whatever I want even with a decently tough course load. What I did with my free time though... *sigh* that's a story for another day.

Alternatively, make homework completely optional, but still ""grade"" it and give feedback for the students that give a reasonable attempt at the homework. This would give even more flexibility to motivated students but would take away the grade buffer many of us depend on. This model probably will not work in required classes as many students are unmotivated simply because they're not interested, but is definitely a plausible one in 3000/4000 level courses.",Negative,"topics: education, homework, time management, grading, student motivation.",32,2019-09-22

comment,"I'm not saying I don't learn from homework. It's just that I find it needlessly stressful and ridiculous that our homework is getting graded based on a certain degree of perfection and mastery on skills a week after it was covered in class (or sometimes, not even covered in class at all).

That being said, most people don't agree with this but I actually think some textbooks are a very useful resource. I do agree that reading through the textbook once or twice causes more confusion than clarity, but a third, fourth, or even fifth time actually does help (over a span of 2-3 weeks - repetition over a longer period of time seems to be key), because it allows me to understand the concept on a deeper level than what we really need. This really helps and it makes the difficult homework problems 2-3 weeks ago and even some exam problems actually quite trivial (minus the intense calculations involved at times). From there, I do as many problems as I can in the textbook, with lecture notes and homework as a guide as to what we need to know in the class, picking textbook problems that fall in line with that. Doing this over a longer period of time actually allows me to learn the material rather than trying to perfect my homework over a week and still getting penalized for essentially being a slow learner. This semester, I can't follow this method because I'm spending my days perfecting my homework and crying in lab rather than reading the textbook and doing extra problems and I'm struggling in classes and quite frustrated because of this.

I definitely agree with the question bank and solutions method, as it is basically what I do except I have to pick my own problems in the textbook, which is a problem since I can't verify my solutions easily (I usually go to a tutor/TA or the professor).

During my interview I mainly talked through projects I had done, and answered why I designed parts of them certain ways. I asked a lot of questions about the job and about NCR's tech culture.

If you whiteboard it won't be language specific, since within NCR they use a ton of different languages.

Dr Platt would lecture really fast and wouldn‚Äôt provide the lecture slides on canvas, and there is a lot of material to learn.

, or elaborate on things I didn‚Äôt understand (the textbook might help you with those difficult topics, but don‚Äôt waste time reading the entire textbook page by page, for Platt or santangelo).

Then for the exams I would just study those notes and work through practice problems he provided, and be good to go. practice problems were essential in that class imo, since many of the test problems were focused on problem solving skills (and lots of stoichiometry lol) rather than blatant memorization. but you do need a solid knowledge of the concepts as well, just don‚Äôt get too caught up in the details unless they tell you you need to.",Positive,study tips,1,2019-09-23

‚Äú Some years ago, I was lucky enough invited to a gathering of great and good people: artists and scientists, writers and discoverers of things. And I felt that at any moment they would realise that I didn‚Äôt qualify to be there, among these people who had really done things.

On my second or third night there, I was standing at the back of the hall, while a musical entertainment happened, and I started talking to a very nice, polite, elderly gentleman about several things, including our shared first name. And then he pointed to the hall of people, and said words to the effect of, ‚ÄúI just look at all these people, and I think, what the heck am I doing here? They‚Äôve made amazing things. I just went where I was sent.‚Äù

And I said, ‚ÄúYes. But you were the first man on the moon. I think that counts for something.‚Äù And I felt a bit better. Because if Neil Armstrong felt like an imposter, maybe everyone did. Maybe there weren‚Äôt any grown-ups, only people who had worked hard and also got lucky and were slightly out of their depth, all of us doing the best job we could, which is all we can really hope for.‚Äù",Positive,imposter syndrome,83,2019-09-24

comment,"If we had functioning transit, this wouldn't be such an issue. Whenever you see this scooter mess, you're seeing the breakdown of vital campus services, and a student population overburdened with the need to fill the gaps themselves because the system that already took their money isn't working. It takes a whole system to fail before things get this bad. 31 scooters on the street is selfish behavior, yes, but it's also not fair to put the entire onus on the smallest functioning component in the system (the student), with the fewest resources to deal with the overall problems. 

Or in other words, if you generate a huge systemic problem for students who are already overworked, under-slept, broke, late for class, and desperate, and you replicate this problem for *thousands* of constituent members, we're probably lucky it's only 30 or 50 scooters at a time. Individuals will solve their problems, and the less the community supports them, the less engagement they'll have to act civilly while doing so. 

It makes me mad that there are so many scooters that this atrocious behavior has become normalized, but it also makes me mad that students have already paid for useless parking, useless transit, and now have to pay again for a 3rd party individually-sourced solution. A Tech student a year ago did the math on overall scooter costs, and posted to this sub. Buying and throwing away a used car *every semester* would be cheaper than renting scooter rides. But thanks to PTS, you'd have nowhere to park it! Checkmate, students! 

Groome Transportation doesn't strictly *have* to run a usable system, because their customer (Georgia Tech) isn't setting and enforcing standards of acceptable services. That's kind of like how Aramark is just feeding us spoiled milk and the only consequence is a new complaint every week on Reddit.

My un-researched guess is that usable services aren't actually profitable enough to attract a corporate outsourcer. 

That's why they shouldn't have outsourced transit, and should have trained student workers to get CDL's instead. We could probably cut parking fees in half if we did it in-house and weren't subsidizing a corporation. We could break even, or just make like 1% profit, but could substantially lower costs to students and faculty and staff, and cut down on DIY nuisance solutions that cost us all more in the long run.",Negative,"public transportation, campus services, student issues, outsourcing",40,2019-09-24

comment,"As someone who bikes on campus, I can‚Äôt speak for everyone who does this. But I can say that there are certain spots where it feels safer to bike on the sidewalks than to bike in the lane itself. A lot of this has to do with cars and reckless driving. I personally will ride on the sidewalks rather than certain streets like 10th just because of how dangerous they are for riding bikes.

Furthermore, try to keep in mind that if you as a pedestrian get hit by a bike, you‚Äôll have some injuries but most likely will survive. If someone on a bike gets hit by a car, the injuries are more severe, and death is far more likely. Civil disobedience may be saving a cyclist‚Äôs life. So next time don‚Äôt think of a cyclist on the sidewalk as an asshole. Think of them as someone who values their life more than adhering to that one law, especially when it puts their life at risk.

Do I agree with riding on sidewalks around campus? No, but I understand the thoughts that led to that decision.","Neutral

comment,"I definitely second this. Some of my favorite things to do aren't at all related to my major, but it's key to know what those things are so you can enjoy life. We're often sold this idea that if your career is not your single greatest passion, you're wasting your life. This is **NOT** true!! You can have great passions that aren't your major/career, and that's completely ok!! College is a great time to find these passions ‚Äì if you can turn them into a career, then that's awesome, but if they're what you have to look forward on evenings/weekends, that's ok too. No matter what Hollywood/social media tells us, life isn't ever going to be a never-ending pleasure trip. Even people that do exactly what they're passionate hate their job from time to time, so don't burden yourself with the unreasonable expectation that you need to find something that fills you with joy every day in your career. 

Another tip is to find community. It's extremely easy here at Tech to become a homework-eat-sleep machine that spends days without talking to another person. I know ‚Äì it's happened to me every semester and this is my 5th year. The biggest factor for my not losing it here has been my support system and the community I have here on campus is a really huge part of that. For me, that's been my campus ministry. For you, it might be a club, roommates, people you meet through classes, etc. I'm sure that there's something that you do that makes you happy. The great thing about being at a bigger school like this is that you're almost guaranteed to find someone else that also loves that thing! Finding those people and supporting each other is key.

Lastly, please don't give up hope. Reaching out for help, even here on Reddit, is a sign that you're open to change and that's the first step. You're not alone, everyone else here either has or will be feeling very similar things. We're all rooting for you, and I know you're going to make it and do great things!",Positive,"life, passions, community, support, hope.",2,2019-09-25

For applying online, most companies will post their positions on Careerbuzz, which is our job board that‚Äôs just for GT students. They‚Äôll tell you to apply to the Careerbuzz posting (some companies will also have you go through the official posting on their website as well).

This allows resumes to go directly to a recruiting team for Georgia Tech, instead of some faceless HR system where thousands of resumes go to die. That‚Äôs essentially what being a ‚Äútarget school‚Äù means: companies will have a dedicated recruiting team for the school that will look at resumes and hand out interviews solely to students at that school. 

So even if you get into the career fair and hit it off with the recruiters there (never mind the fact that they‚Äôll immediately see that you‚Äôre not a GT student from your resume), nearly everyone will still tell you to apply online through Careerbuzz so you can go through their campus recruiting system...which you don‚Äôt have access to because you‚Äôre not a GT student.",Negative,"career fair, application, target school",15,2019-09-25

comment,"Kantwon here. Not sure if you are in my section or not, but just thought I'd chime in.   


The class is of course not perfect. However, we do try our best to create a course that in its entirety affords students knowledge of basic CS concepts and skills. From my historically polling over the last 7 years involved in the class, 2/3 of the people who enter the course have never programmed before, which is very different than other intro/1st year courses (People have done math, chem, physics, etc, before coming to Tech). Therefore, having the class be entirely project based or open-ended would likely cause much more harm than good. The 1171 class that was mentioned in another response is for people who already had significant prior programming experience and just need Matlab credit for the CS thread. Given this prior experience, having it project based it feasible.   


That being said, I do agree that the tests do not emphasize creative problem solving and adequately testing your code, as you mentioned. But that is what homework is designed to do. Tests are designed to have very similar concepts/problems as what has been covered in homework, lectures, and recitations such that problem solving on the test is not as novel and time consuming. For every single concept/problem on the exam, I can point to multiple problems or examples that have been done in homework or lecture that are extremely similar.  Although the tests do assess a lower-level of problem solving, what they primarily focus on is tracing and syntax. I believe it is very valuable to have learners not become completely dependent on a tool (in this case the Matlab environment). This is analogous to how the math department does not allow advanced calculators in lower-level classes. Being able to confidently write and trace through simple programs without needing the computer creates a base foundation that then is able to be improved upon with the help of the computer. Moreover, given my experience in industry software engineering, a significant portion of the job is reading code written by other people and understanding it and possibly adding to it or adopting it into your own--which is why we emphasize some sort of tracing on every exam.   


However, one of the largest problems that this class has is the size. Learning at scale is a VERY hard thing to manage. It's becoming a very hot area of research within computer science and education. Nowadays, on average, 700ish people are in the class every semester (it used to be closer to 1000). A class of this size does not easily allow for project based assessments due to grading and feedback personalization. You compared the class to computer graphics which has an undergrad section of 150 and grad section of 50. This difference in scale makes this comparison disingenuous. In the past we have had exams on the computer (where code was essentially typed into a notepad document without access to Matlab) but there were issues with this system due to class size and data retention. I would like for homeworks to be worth more in the class; however, this is also problematic because of issues of collaboration/cheating at scale.   


We are constantly trying to improve the class and we know it has its flaws. But to account for these flaws that have yet to be completely resolved we have designed the course to have A LOT of leniency and ways for people to still do very well even if some things don't go well. Every homework can be submitted twice, there is extra credit on every homework, there is help desk 30+ hours every week, there are lecturer office hours, we have very fast responses on piazza, we post practice exams, we have the database of practice questions of all types, and there is the unofficial final exam grade replacement policy. There are little to no classes at Tech that provide as many resources and chances to allow for success as this class does. 

&amp;#x200B;

My research area is in computer science education. Unlike other disciplines that have had centuries to understand how to best educate learners, CS does not have this privileged. The world as a whole has very little knowledge on the best ways to teach people computer science, and seeing as the tech industry is rapidly changing, there is even more confusion on how to best prepare students for a rapidly moving target. However, I base many of the decisions I make in pedagogy and class structure around research that has been done on teaching and learning. If you have any suggestions on how to better improve the class, please do reach out and we can see what we can do!",Positive,"education, computer science, teaching.",95,2019-09-25

comment,"Would be nice to see some enforcement near Tech Square for cars/pedestrians/cyclists. Seems there is usually an officer walking around while cars are cutting cyclists off/making abrupt u-turns/opening doors into traffic, cyclists going through the red light and sidewalk, and pedestrians glued to their phones wandering into the street. Enforcing all forms of traffic at the same time in a single location goes a long way in preventing finger-pointing and helping everyone recognize the danger.

The other spot I have issues with is Ferst and Atlantic, mainly turning left from Ferst onto Atlantic. I've been told by officers that when the light is red, I have to ride to the front of traffic and sit in the magical green box (assuming a car isn't blocking it) until the light turns green for both cars and bikes. To turn left, I have to wait for the opposing traffic to pass by, meanwhile I'm blocking traffic and getting honked at. Not to mention I'm trying to turn left across traffic and maneuver past the barriers, phone-distracted pedestrians, and sometimes illegally parked cars/trucks. But if I reach the light when it's green, I have to pull over onto the sidewalk, dismount, press the cross button, and wait for the other light to turn green before proceeding onto Atlantic OR merge into traffic and block any traffic behind me.

That Ferst/Atlantic intersection is so poorly planned for cyclists trying to turn left from Ferst onto the brick path. I've been honked at countless times for doing what is considered legal. That light needs a dedicated time for cyclists to pass if you're asking bikes to simultaneously merge with one-lane traffic near bus stops AND turn left onto a pedestrian-busy pathway.",Negative,"traffic, enforcement, safety",6,2019-09-25

comment,"Hi, SGA here. 

In response to today's developments with the Community Market, we want to be honest and transparent with you, and we also want to provide you with accurate information directly from those involved.¬†

Here is an update we received today from Georgia Tech‚Äôs Auxiliary Services:¬†

‚ÄúCampus Services is committed to offering a quality community market, in conjunction with student needs and institute sustainability goals. While the market was originally scheduled for today, it has been rescheduled for a few reasons:

During the spring 2019 semester, the Health Department raised concerns with the type of permits that were required for market vendors to operate on campus. This caused Campus Services to temporarily suspend market operations in order to review our processes and procedures, as well as legal requirements, to ensure the Institute is fully compliant. This review is not yet complete, so the Market scheduled for Sept. 25th has been postponed to Oct. 9th.

A steering committee has been created to guide the market and focus its direction. The committee is comprised of several stakeholders including GT Sustainability, SGA, the Student Center, Auxiliary Services, Health Initiatives and GT Dining. The committee has decided to align the market with Institute sustainability goals and broaden its scope to include local farmers in addition to merchant vendors as well as participation from GT sustainability groups.

A survey has been created to generate feedback on what the community would like to see in the Market. The results of this survey will help the steering committee choose applicable vendors for future markets and mold the future of the program. To participate in this survey, please click [here](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bgci9aDD0AHCbxH).‚Äù¬†

In sum, we want you to know that we do hear you, and our priority is to get the Community Market back on campus as soon as possible and as frequently as possible.

They are meant to give the people running the class the ability to give out the grade distribution Georgia Tech (or the CS department) wants them to.  The professors and the TA's seem to know that getting an A on a test only roughly correlates with coding and CS ability.

But seriously, you should definitely change your perspective on what ""doing good in general"" means. Most people who come here had excellent grades in high school, yet I've never been in a class where the class GPA was 4.0. It's harder here, and you're working with people who were all top of their highschool classes. A few Bs are not bad. In  some classes, a B is pretty impressive. 

Also, don't get caught up on ideas like a 90% is an A, 70% is C. I've been in many classes where you didn't even need a 50 to pass and an A was somewhere around 65-70. See how the class averages are doing. 

If you're really worried about your performance, go talk to your professors and TAs. Most of the professors are very helpful in office hours. Despite some of the rumors, most of them are people too and want to help you succeed and learn. 

There are also tons of other academic resources on campus. Take advantage of them early. 

Most importantly, don't get discouraged. Classes are hard here, but you were chosen to be here because admissions knew you could succeed in this environment and that you can do great things. Speaking from experience, giving up is the easiest way to make sure you don't do well in a class.

comment,"I live on McMillan and have been riding through that intersection for years, maybe lucky but never been honked at.  As someone else said, just take the right lane and if someone comes up behind you to turn simply pull up and to the left to let them go.  I usually wave them on or even wave them off if it's not safe for them to turn at that time.  How are you getting run off the road?  Good defensive biking involves taking the lane when it's not safe for someone to pass you.  So you should be in the middle of the lane, not to the side (basically inviting them to run you off the road).  Getting out of the way for someone to turn is just common courtesy.


I've found that asserting your place in the road and good use of hand signals (also look for eye contact from other drivers so you know they see you) will save you from most if not all the problems people complain about.  If you were to continue down Hemphill you would need to basically merge into the other lane (yes there is a bike lane but people use it for space when there are no bikers).  Slowly drifting into it without looking is suicide.  Looking back, making eye contact, and pointing to the lane as you move into it is safe, and if you see that the person doesn't see you, simply stay out of their way.",Positive,"biking, road safety",4,2019-09-26

comment,"*Background: I conducted hundreds of interviews over the last decade when I was an engineer at Large Silicon Valley Tech Company(tm).  For undergrads, the interviews are generally coding a solution on paper or whiteboard for a problem that's not trivial, but still solvable with standard data structures and algorithms.  The interviewer will have some follow up questions on edge cases, running time, or space complexity.*

My advice is to practice writing code on a whiteboard.  Grab some problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and see if you can write it out without an IDE.  Interviewers know programmers rely on software to remember library and function names and will be forgiving of small errors in syntax but less so with logic.  Make sure you can derive the space and time complexity.

If you want the real Life Pro Tip for interviewing, become a TA.  Not because it boosts your resume but because you'll spend hours each week writing code on whiteboards while explaining complex subjects to strangers, which is basically interviewing.  I TA'd and Head TA'd 1331 or 1332 every semester after my freshman year and credit it as the both the most significant part of my collegiate experience and that which made coding interviews easy.

Well there‚Äôs your problem right there. I‚Äôm only half joking. 

I don‚Äôt think your problem is solely because you‚Äôre on West campus vs. East. Being in a normal freshman dorm vs. Woodies is so much better for social interactions because you‚Äôre surrounded by freshmen and everyone is generally open to interacting and meeting new people. It‚Äôs why I recommend participating in FE despite being forced into the meal plan, simply because it makes socializing so much easier.

I‚Äôd recommend going to clubs if you‚Äôre looking to find people with similar interests; people going to clubs in general tend to be more open to meeting new friends. If you‚Äôre into sports at all, try jumping in to a game of basketball at the CRC or frisbee/soccer in the fields.

I was extremely depressed for most of my time at Tech due to some outside issues. I ended with a 3.56 and felt like a failure because I never felt like I applied myself enough. I would cram just enough to scrape by with a B, and then forget everything. I never felt like I really learned the material. 

I had two interviews before I graduated that went nowhere because I was such a mess. I ended up going to the alumni career fair the following May and got a couple hits from there!

Now I work up in PA at a factory (yes, those still exist) making little plastic widgets. I work in the Quality Assurance lab. I get to spend all day weighing widgets and putting them in the crusher and looking at the resulting stress-strain curve. Now that I see the giant extruders on the factory floor every day, I realize I should have paid better attention in Polymer Processing (sorry Dr. Yao). 

Oh, and I work a shift rotation (2-3 days on, 2-3 days off) so I'm typing this on my day off. I have therapy today and it's going fantastic! Don't be discouraged if the Counselling Center doesn't help. There are so many good therapists out there.

\*Disclaimer: I technically got the job offer at 5 months 29 days, but I purposefully took the weekend to ""think about it"" so I could tell the MSE department that I was 6 months unemployed to tank their job placement stats.

comment,"So glad you did this. I wish there were more threads like this while I was at Tech. 

May 2017, BS ChBE grad. Finished with a super low gpa like 2.2 or 2.3 or something. Didn‚Äôt take school seriously *at all* for the first two-three years. I think my junior year I tried to switch to IE, took a semester of IE classes and realized it would take forever for me to finish so I went back to ChemE. As I was getting closer and closer to graduation I started putting way more effort into my studies. Very little going out, much more time in the library and office hours. My grades were trending upward but I had gotten so many bad grades that it was only making very small improvements in my gpa. Luckily I got an opportunity to do research one summer (shear luck, had a friend who was graduating and he recommended me) but I could barely even get any interviews for internships and I was really really down on myself. A lot of ‚Äòwhy am I doing this? why am I here?‚Äô etc. But I was too deep into my loans so I had to keep going until I graduated. 

Eventually I did graduate after 5 years with 2 or 3 summers where I took classes. I was happy to get out of there but then the real fun began, finding a job. A tough process. But I told myself no matter how long it took or how many rejections I got, I wouldn‚Äôt get down on myself like I did at Tech. And honestly, you have to have that mindset. It took me like 8 months to finally get a job offer. Underpaid, not in a booming city at all but now I‚Äôm using this experience to get my foot in the door at other companies.

all this to say, Tech was - by FAR - the hardest goal i've completed in my life.

Luckily, freshman forgiveness gave me the opportunity to retake Calc 1 that summer and I was able to get myself to a 3.0.

The next year, I realized that ME might not be for me, and I switched to CM. I managed to get my GPA up, slowly and with a lot of hard work and tears, and was able to get a job before I graduated.

I was on academic probation and my parents were considering pulling me out of school. I was suffering from crippling depression and struggling in my classes even though I had found a traditional support network in my fraternity.

Luckily around this time I somehow managed to convince a company to give me a coop position with a 2.1 GPA (overall) and an even lower major GPA. My girlfriend at the time (now fiance) pushes me into high gear come fall and I completely change the way I'm approaching classes, manage to make it through the rest of my collegiate career with 2 C's from then on. Graduate this past Dec with a 2.8 GPA. Hired out of graduation with the company I cooped with.

If I could do it all again, I'd say:

1. Your mental health affects everything. If you have depression that makes doing things you want to do impossible then you definitely won't be able to study. And yes, sitting in front of your TV playing destiny for 3/4 hours a day when you have a test that week counts.

2. Get involved. Clubs not only help with the above mental health but are a welcome distraction. Networking is also more important than anything you learn in class. I got my job from a guy I used to drink with off campus who told me his company would take resumes no questions asked if you had a recommendation.

My advice during a job search is the same as when in school: pay attention to your mental health.  Try to work out and eat well.  Spend time outdoors.  

Bottom line: figure out how to shake off the negative self talk and comparisons. You have talents to offer an employer AND to others.  Sometimes (often), true fulfillment comes outside the workplace.  Your success in school and at work does not define you as a human being.","Neutral

Ended up going back to AtL to another job that payed a lot less to save my sanity. Switched jobs a again even though it's mostly paper work than actual engineering. Tried to start my MAsters in Computer science, but felt sad and depressed since it was work all day, study all night kind of schedule with no time to socialize or meet people.

The income opens up opportunities like better living standards, affording things you didn't think you could before, and doing hobbies you feel passionate about.

However, that does not mean for a second that you should not demand a better experience while at Tech. Current students reading this, it is worth asking why adult life, with all the stresses and difficulties it entails, is so vastly better than life at GT. Everything I've accomplished since graduating could have been done sooner and easier if I had not spent 30k per year for the privilege of being terrorized by professors and mostly ignored by the mental health facilities. There's a tendency with these kind of success stories for there to be an undercurrent of ""it gets better, so stop complaining"". Ignore that. Demand better of your school if you are suffering.

comment,"ME 2018 here. Was extremely down on myself and depressed my sophomore year at GT. Had a 2.72 overall, thought it was impossible that I'd ever manage to reach my dreams of working in nano and microtechnology. 

Buckled down on myself, gave up on the bullshit stereotype that I had to be partying every weekend or I wasn't living, and tightened up my study habits like no other. Made three straight semesters of 4.0's and got my GPA up to a 3.33, which was enough to get me into graduate school here. 

Currently going into my second year as a GRA doing research into Memristors. If I can pull off that turnaround, so can you. Gotta be tough and uncompromising with yourself ‚Äì you will have to make sacrifices. Your mental health is your responsibility, as is your own happiness. If you are doing things that you know aren't healthy for yourself, and you're denying it, nothing you do is going to make you happy. Whether that's alcohol, drugs, toxic organizations, toxic relationships, video games, television, or whatever vice you know you don't have control over in your life, you have to exercise your personal discipline over it if you want any chance at feeling good about yourself. That's what the essence of being an adult is; not doing the things you know you'd enjoy but that you also know wouldn't be good for you.  

Boiled down, I suppose you can condense my message to a fairly simple phrase: listen to your guilty conscience. 

One of the best pieces of advice I ever received was that you are everything both wrong and right with yourself. You don't like where  or who you are, you have the power to change that.

comment,"Yup. I had like a 3.71 for most of my undergrad. And then I just got to a point where I hated my life due to major depression and I just spiraled. I couldn't keep it together at the level I needed to. I retook u/O 3x. I just kept failing because I hated certain aspects of my major and depression clouded my ability to make the adjustments I needed. It wasn't until I took an IC FAB class in that janky Van Leer basement that things started clicking for me. I found what I loved -- hardware building.

We just had an intern supporting one of our projects here from GT doing another BS degree (after graduating from Emory and not being able to get a job in her field) she went back at 29 to get an engineering degree. Older students are there and they are cool! Technical pursuits are hard, but they are fun! 

I got around it by taking lower level jobs. I got in the door as a technician at NGC. I did my tasks which were easy and then I followed around all the senior level engineers on my team. When a job opened, I applied and every single one of them voted for me because I was smart and they knew I had already shown work ethic and simple, they liked me. Once you get past the ""years of experience"" burden, shit goes so easy.

Early action is sort of like an extra chance, and I've heard odds are better if apply early. Just from experience I had 3 friends who applied regular with SAT scores around 1450 and get denied (keep in mind it is a holistic process) and a bunch of friends who applied early with SAT scores around 1400 (including me) get accepted.

I was the opposite. Very serious my first years. Depression, non serious and party mode in my latter years.

I had a blast in the end and was exposed to things that were impressive to people. Doing fabrication work as an undergraduate was majorly impressive to everyone I interviewed with. GT has awesome opportunities and it's challenging. I skinny dipped in the campanile. I went on top of every roof I could. I studied late nights. I made life long friends.

For a lot of these students, yes, they were the top student in their little corner of the world. But for a lot of them their support structures aren't as good as other people's. There exist families that don't love you, unless you are successful bordering on perfection. Mine is one of them. Also financial concerns are very real for a lot of people. There is frankly a lot at stake and a lot of change when you begin this process and it's hard to balance things.

GT is an excellent place. They are lucky to be in the environment and to be tested, but for some people they lose perspective and there have been suicides because of isolation and stress. I was almost one of them. This is why I made the post. We have a responsibility to you guys as your Alumni to support you and allow you guys to benefit from our advisement and experiences. A lot of people don't get their needs met easily and it gets discouraging. A lot of people are afraid to ask for help and fear being met with harsh judgement. No one gets through this shit alone. We can't solve it for you, but we can give advisement and take the conversation into a good place. It takes time to hone your process and fire on all cylinders effectively. Life will beat you up sometimes.

Have empathy for others. You never know what others are going through. Also C's get degrees.

Reveling in negativity is easier than choosing the positive response and appreciating the experience.

We, as alumni, are responding to challenge these people who are having doubts to continue fighting for themselves. To tell them, yes, this process made me who the fuck I am and I'm glad for it. I don't care if people get butthurt over it, because this is what participation in a community is and this is my method to contribute to the betterment of this community.

However, I will admit that during my first semester I did not use the multitude of 1000-2000 level class resources (office hours, math HELP DESK!!!!! in CULC, free 1-1 tutoring, etc.). I'm confident if I used those I could've gotten through the class if I used them. I use them every day nowadays and they keep me afloat even though I'm not the brightest student. There are so many resources that are specifically for these classes so take advantage of them while you still can!

What's prestige going to bring you if you're not happy working there? 

I would still encourage you to continue with your internship search though because it's always good to explore other opportunities. Have your return offer as a backup option.

I've had a few jobs where it wasn't difficult at all to get up in the morning, make the commute and get going.   Part of that was what I was doing, but a much larger part of that were the people I was working with and working for.

comment,"If you haven't already (I think you have), look at the [undergraduate](https://math.gatech.edu/projected-schedule-of-undergraduate-courses) and [graduate](https://math.gatech.edu/projected-schedule-of-graduate-courses) projected schedules for the math department. I have both of these pages bookmarked in a folder. 

The three classes you listed are ""not currently offered,"" which sucks. You could try to talk to people/professors and convince them to get to offer the class next semester, but I would be very impressed if you could pull that off.

As for actual advice:

Consider taking graduate classes. You're only a second year atm, and that will require jumping through some administrative hoops, but it's doable. Graduate classes are also very different--the go extremely quickly through the material and expect you to teach yourself lots of thing (though the grading can sometimes be easier). If you do decide to do this, please please talk to non-internetstrangers. Ask some grad students who are on the applied track how the classes were, and TALK TO STEINBART before making any decisions.

Second (not mutually exclusive) option is to talk to one of your professors that you know and try to set up a reading course. Basically just say ""hey I'm really interested in learning more about _____, but it isn't offered blabla do you have any book recommendations, blabla would it be possible to set up a reading course."" I've actually never done this, so I'd recommend also TALKING TO STEINBART to see what your options are.

Third option related to the second--join the directed reading program. Basically they pair you off with a grad student and have you read something, then you talk about it. Exactly what you do varies depending on who/what you're working with but I currently read some pages from a textbook, then talk about it with a grad student once a week. Last semester I was reading random papers. Talk with the organizers (John Etnyre, Kevin Kordek, Dan Margalit, all very friendly), and see if you can get a grad student *specifically in the areas you are interested in*.

Hope that helps. I'm happy to answer more questions to the extent I am able.

comment,"I graduated a few years ago with a BS in Aerospace Engineering. Trying to juggle school, applying to scholarships, applying for internships/jobs, working (TA and lab assistant), my health, and my social life was always a huge struggle for me. There were several periods during school where I was on the brink of a mental breakdown from all of the stress I was under. There were days where I'd have ""cry"" in my schedule just so I could get it out of my system.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated with a 3.6 GPA but was super anxious because I didn't have a job lined up and was never able to get an internship (applied to hundreds as an undergrad with not much luck). As other AE's can attest to, having no industry experience while looking for a full time job makes things way harder. Took me six soul crushing months after graduating to finally land a job.

&amp;#x200B;

All the days of tailoring resumes, cover letters, going through phone interviews, getting ghosted by recruiters, and going to in person interviews paid off in the end. I got a job at my dream company and have been able to do things I never thought I'd be able to. I've been able to travel for work, do analysis, do hands on work, and am able to interface with a bunch of different disciples in aerospace. I've also gotten to work on a bunch of interesting projects. When I graduated I never thought I'd be able to get such a breadth of experience so quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

I also showed a bunch of initiative and really hit the ground running. I was promoted twice within my first five years of working and got several awards and special bonuses acknowledging my work. I have also made great connections that I know I can use whenever I decide to change positions.

Whether it is the potential for on-campus interviews or being fast-tracked through the application process, students want a tangible reason to talk to your company. Students don't want to be told about the company and to apply online after waiting in line for so long; it's borderline disrespectful. A good example of that this year was IBM; the line was gigantic and they had multiple recruiters present, but in the end, all they did was tell you to apply online. Another good example is taking resumes as an application to the company if a candidate is qualified. That way, they know you're interested at the very least and are being told a script.

The reason why you're told to apply online is because you've literally provided just the information that the recruiter would get from your online application. I.e. you are wasting their time and have demonstrated that you don't care about the position at all.

Use the face to face time for what it is. Get to know more about the recruiter, their job at the company, and what they're looking for on their team. Find out what it takes to get on their radar because that's what it means to actually be interested in the position. If your resume were good enough that you can show it by itself and they give you an interview, then you're not the kind of person who is waiting in line for hours to speak to one recruiter.

Think about it. The point of the fair is not to parade your resume around to every company. Rather, it's to get the opportunity to actually speak to recruiters in person. Expecting that you'll see a return on investment by throwing your resume into a pile of hundreds boggles my mind.

I think homework can help us study, but at the same it is kind of annoying because it takes too much energy and time. At the original post, I was trying to find some way to balance between my study and life. Because I was finding myself constrained to a more and more dull routine, go to class, come back to apartment, sit down and do homework. No social and no exploring. That worries me, because you know, people repeatedly doing the same thing ends up crazy.  But I think I could not blame all that on homework, because I think part of that is due to myself. I think I could take some time to go out and explore new things. After all, homework here is far better than the homework I used to do in undergraduate school. Back to my undergraduate school, professors used up pick up some questions on the textbook after class. There will be feedback on our homework, but there are no detailed solutions. We need figure them out by ourselves.  It was terrible for someone trying hard to learn. Usually, my confidence is destroyed after two weeks of class.  So I think homework here can in a degree helps us learn. (But I am in graduate school, I think undergraduate students are taking much more pressure than us.)  But I think your idea on changing homework is graded is great.

comment,"So I'm going to be a bit of a black sheep here.  BS MGT, got out in 2005.  My GPA was 3.0.  I went into private finance right out of Tech and did that for a few years, but it was a ton of work and I didn't feel like I was making a huge difference.  Now I work for the federal government at a regulatory agency, overseeing the banking industry.  It's far more interesting, far more challenging, and I feel like I'm doing a huge amount of good.  I won't ever get rich, but I get a ton of time off, a pension, 401k matching, and my pay scale is above GS-15 (if you want to look that up).  I'll be able to retire at 55 if I really want to, though I probably won't.  A lot of people say they want to ""work to live, not live to work"" and I get to actually do that.  Tech prepared me in ways that I am still uncovering even today.  It can be the crucible that turns you into who you have the potential to be.

And if you‚Äôre using alphaE to E, then it‚Äôs ln(E/E‚Äô) and dE‚Äô; Range is over the potential scattered energies (alphaE lowest, E highest) so you want to integrate over all final energies dE‚Äô. 

And yes, integrate, and profit. Use change of variables. 

So, integral of (ln(ratio of initial to final energies) * probability of scattering to a final energy), integrated over all final energies, which are between alphaE and E. 

this is RP 1 right? Perhaps it‚Äôs more ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù for that reason. Dealing with transport/diffusion will be much more complex, so perhaps my view is from hindsight.

comment,"That sucks, man. I lost my wallet back in April and it never turned up anywhere. 

First of all, cancel all your cards. Check for any fraudulent charges ASAP. Start the process of getting new ones. I know you seem optimistic someone will identify your wallet and return it, but you probably need a way to spend your money in the meantime/ if it never comes back. Pro tip: it may take a few days to receive your cards, so ask for a temporary card which they can give you right away. 

Next I would make a few calls. Call GTPD and ask if they have your wallet. Usually if it turns up there, they‚Äôll find your student ID and call/email you that they have it. I would try anyway. Same with APD. Just call the non emergency line! After that I checked transportation services (in case it went missing on a bus), and then lost and found in every building you recall being in. 

If this doesn‚Äôt work, I think it is time to assemble your new wallet. I hated having to rebuy a wallet/ID/buzzcard, but it taught me to be way more cognizant of my wallet. It sucked, but eh that‚Äôs life.

I would apply for a new ID if it doesn‚Äôt turn up by monday. It‚Äôs very important to have in general and I wouldn‚Äôt want to go too long without one. It would just make life easier rather than carrying 2 supporting documents for your identification. 

Next, a new buzzcard. You may take an exam that requires it, or to access certain buildings, maybe even your dorm. If you hated your old picture, this is a new opportunity! Or they can use the old one if you want. 

After that, just everything else including a new wallet. If the old one turns up that‚Äôs great! But there‚Äôs only so long you should wait before starting the process of making a new one. I would also look into the Tile lineup for tracking items. They have a wallet tracker that fits in a card slot.

I hope it was worth the potentially hundreds of dollars of after-insurance cost for your urgent care visit + prescription.

I know it sucks having the flu, but if you're a normally healthy individual that aren't in one of the high-risk groups (elderly, hospitalized, child), there are some major diminishing returns for anything beyond basic OTC ibuprofen and day/nyquil. There's a reason why the consensus from licensed medical professionals for dealing with the flu is to get lots of food, water, and rest, with maybe an ibuprofen/other OTC drug to alleviate some symptoms if they get too bad.",Negative,"healthcare, flu, medication",7,2019-09-29

comment,"The slur is probably one part of it, the other, bigger, part is just how entitled and whiny you come across. Let's break it down:

&gt;Thank you for being closed on the weekends while I'm very sick.

Stamps isn't a full hospital. It sucks that they're closed on the weekends when students are sick, but that's why there are other hospitals you can go to. Stamps isn't supposed to be urgent care; in fact most hospitals and medical facilities in my experience don't have appointment options available on the weekends. You'll simply be directed to urgent care/the emergency room if you need to see a doctor on the weekend.

&gt;Thank you for not offering flu shots until next week, despite the flu going around. 

It's not like they have flu shots and are choosing to withhold them because they're dumb. Flu incidence rates begin increasing around October/November, which is considered to be the start of ""flu season"". With the way the medical supply chain works, they probably haven't even gotten their flu shots in yet because they can't anticipate the flu season starting earlier than normal this year when they're placing the orders months, maybe even a year, away.

&gt;Thank you for having an archaic system that makes it difficult for me to get a sick note when I really need it. 

Don't you need to make an appointment to get a sick note? What's difficult about it? Sure the appointment system can be hard to navigate, but I haven't had too much trouble with it when I needed to make an appointment. If you're just complaining about how hard it is to make an appointment online, I'd say that's more of a budget issue and not really something worth calling them a slur over, no?

&gt;I finally went to an urgent care clinic with the Emory health system, and they actually helped me. Looks like one atlanta school knows how medicine works. 

Emory Healthcare is the largest healthcare system in Georgia. They serve the general public, Stamps does not. Emory has a killer medical school. We're first and foremost a STEM school. No shit their healthcare system is better than Stamps, it's not about ""knowing how medicine works"".

&gt;Thanks for giving the sickest people I know otc medication which is weaker than Geoff Collins's offense. At least you're not sending the doctors to strip clubs with 300 cash.

What? Are these people sick with the flu as well? [As I explained in my earlier comment,](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/dav3xz/dear_stamps_health_services_youre_retarded/f1y623w/) you really can't do much when you have the flu, and antivirals don't do that much more to help vs. OTC drugs when you're not a part of the high-risk populations.

&gt;Sincerely, A freshman with the flu in a dorm where everyone has the flu

This is the best part, the ribbon that really ties your whole post together. 

You have the flu. Yes it sucks. Yes you feel awful. We've all had it, we all know what you're going through.

Are you really demanding that Stamps be open over the weekend so that they can tell you ""you have the flu, get lots of rest and water"" and maybe give you a Tylenol? What exactly are you trying to get out of them here? Do you want a sick note for when you're experiencing severe symptoms, which last 2-3 days (aka over the weekend when you don't have tests or assignments due)? Do you want them to do the medically inadvisable and prescribe a normally functioning adult some extra-strength drugs so that they can feel better for a few hours?",Negative,"healthcare, urgent care, medical facilities",15,2019-09-29

&gt;I want to do a double major of math and CS because I plan to study for a master's degree on CS.

I'm not sure how useful a double major is for getting a Master's in CS - a CS degree will make you perfectly qualified for this. Overall, it's certainly possible to get a double major in math and CS but it will likely take you more than 4 years.

comment,"INTA graduated in 2001. No laughing, please.. still had to take CS, calc and chem, and not any kind of modified versions. Which is why I have had the opportunity to correct an interviewer who told me ""You mean you got a BA. Your resume says a BS...""   

Jimmy Dugan was right... The hard \*is\* what makes it great.  I got so stressed out as a student than I broke out in shingles (YES! SHINGLES! **ON MY FACE.**) just about every time finals rolled around. A lot of the good friends I made freshman year transferred out after sophomore year, and I was \**this*\* close to doing it, too. I was convinced that those friends were definitely smarter than me, and if they needed to leave Tech, surely that meant I did, too. But I was so determined to stay. So I did. And to this day, graduation day is one of the high points in my life. I didn't think I was going to make it out, but I did. I had some of my very best memories, experiences and opportunities to grow at Tech, and I wouldn't change it for anything.  Maybe could have done without the shingles on my face... but meh. This too shall pass.

Currently working in STEM outreach here at GT after spending about 12 years in the non-profit world.  I actually worked at the Ferst Center as a student, which got me interested in the world of non-profits. I am not making bank, but I make enough.  I love what I do, and love that I have been able to ""come back"" to Tech and serve the campus and the community at large in this role.  

The long story of how I got here is a much longer one, but I would not have landed here had it not been for the people and experiences I had as a student at Tech.",Positive,"university, college, education, career, memories, challenges, growth, friendship, overcoming obstacles, non-profit work, stem, outreach.",3,2019-09-30

Do you booboo.

&gt;a loser dropping a class because I don't like it

Dropped a city planning elective because it was not interesting to me and too much for for an out of major elective. No regrets, not for me. Wish I had dropped Cell Biology 15 times over and taken 40,000 ECE electives instead. Took German classes for fun.

&gt;Additionally people break bad on those in the media/people thread saying it's ""the weakest link"" in CS here

You're the one who has to live with the choice. Is it financially worth it? Do you think you'll be able to stick with it? Would you learn something applicable which might be good for you later on? Don't make your decisions based on other's haterade. Let those grumpy bros do their dick measuring elsewhere.

Congrats on the job, but still keep your focus on getting the degree. Lots of my CS friends bailed on finishing their degrees, HR still likes the paper, worth it to keep on! :)",Positive,"education, career, advice, personal development.",6,2019-09-30

You're later to this party. But I want you to know that someone read it. Congrats on the AA and transferring! 

Transferring is harder than so many people realize, and I'm so happy for you. 

I wrote to someone else ITT that we had an intern who was 29 who was interning at NASA this summer from GT, because her first routes didn't go as planned. There are older undergrads there and what she said to me was that, ""we tend to find each other."" Find those guys in your classes and get some support amongst the 19 year olds. They exist.

Put yourself first for a while. Work out. Do therapy. Study. Take some debt, if it lets you be stable. It wont be easy, but so much will be under your control if you put your health, your growth and that degree first for a while.
