I am hoping to go down the pre-med track, but I want to keep my options open in case I change my mind later on.\n\nI have been looking at course requirements and 8-term plans for the Chemistry with pre-health concentration on the GT website, but I am unsure about if I should take credit for some of my AP/Dual Enrollment classes. On one hand, it might be a good idea for me to take all the credit I can get and continue with more advanced courses, but on the other hand, I really want to learn the material well so that I can do well on the MCAT and higher level classes that build on the basics.\n\nFor reference, I go to Lakeside High School and I take my DE classes at Georgia State University Perimeter College. The courses that I am considering taking credit for are CHEM 1211 &amp; 1211L (GenChem 1), CHEM 1212 &amp; 1212L (GenChem 2), MATH 2211 (Calc 1), MATH 2212 (Calc 2), PSYC 1101 (Intro Psych), and SOCI 1101 (Intro Sociology).\n\nIf I were to take credit in all of the above classes, I would probably take Organic Chemistry, Introductory Biology, and either Multivariate Calc or Linear Algebra in Fall 2024. This seems a little overwhelming for my first semester, so I am wondering if you guys would recommend padding this a bit by retaking one or both of the GenChems and/or the Calcs.\n\nThanks in advance for your input! To hell with Georgia!",

The quality of schooling, classes, etc? I\u2019m coming from UCLA Mechanical Engineering. \n\n2. Like are the classes really big? I heard from some that GT classes are too big so most Professors tend to do power point slides and don't really dig into how the physics and the equations come from - would you say this is true? \n\n3. How's the social/culture like? Diverse? I've never been outside the west coast. Idk if Atlanta is expensive or not. But I heard it's very humid? Well, I guess only west coast is sunny year round,lol\n\n4. What would make you choose GT&gt; others, what made you pick here? The pros.\n\n5. Anything else? Cons? \n\nI appreciate the help!",

So Firstly, one of my criteria for colleges has always been the professors. I'm avoiding other large colleges that are known are being the only self-study (UC's) and really want to have good teachers. I couldn't find anything about the computer science teachers at GT so I wanted to learn more about that. I also wanted to know how hard the classes really are. I know going into computer science itself is a really tough major and GT it would be even harder, but just to give perspective I'm not a crazy smart student or anything. My stats are kinda mid and way on the low end compared to most students at GT. I'm willing to work hard to keep up, but I really want to understand how hard it will be before I decide. Other sources say its impossible at GT, but I wanted to ask the students themselves. Lastly, I just want to go to a college with a nice community and students who care and are willing to help each other, not people who see you as competitors and ignore/avoid you (other colleges).\n\nSorry I have so many questions, but I really want to GT for college, but I'm also really scared and worried about it",

This summer I will be heading outside Atlanta for an internship and am looking for someone to sublease my apartment at Theory Interlock located on Northside Drive in West Midtown. It's a new apartment building which opened last fall and is about a 15 minute walk from West Campus. They also have a shuttle which runs from 8am-5pm on weekdays to bring students to campus. The rent for my room will be reduced to $1100/month. I will also only charge for the length of the summer semester (I will pay the remainder of August rent from 8/13 onward when the fall semester starts). The total cost would be $2750 for the whole summer stay from 05/3/24-8/13/24. The room is fully furnished with a bed, mattress, walk-in closet, private bathroom, and a desk with a chair for studying. The whole unit is shared with 2 other bedrooms in the same configuration and includes a common area with a couch, table, TV connected to Roku, a kitchen, and free WiFi with speeds around 150 Mbps. There are many food options right around the corner, including but not limited to Cookout, Chick-fil-A, Burger King, Waffle House and more. There is also a Five Guys restaurant, along with a nail salon (Eleven Nail Bar), Starbucks, and a Sushi restaurant--all located next to the apartment. For grocery shopping, I usually go to Atlantic Station where there is a Publix and Target which is about a 30-minute walk. There is a garage for residents and a parking pass can be purchased for $125/month. Guests can park in the Park Mobile spots for $3/hour in the garage located across from the building with all the restaurants. Please feel free to contact me if you have any other questions! I've also posted a listing on this website which was recommended by the off-campus-housing website and it may help other people who are trying to sublease as well or find other options for housing: [https://www.rentcollegepads.com/off-campus-housing/georgia-tech/subleases](https://www.rentcollegepads.com/off-campus-housing/georgia-tech/subleases)",

I use it maybe once a month, if that, and I\u2019ve been trying to get rid of it. I use it so little that I didn\u2019t even know it was booted. The fees are now nearly $600 when my car is worth maybe $900. \n\nI won\u2019t pay that. I\u2019m trying to finish my PhD  and that fee will ruin my life in my current financial situation. My car is basically worthless as is and I\u2019d be just fine just getting rid of it. The boot company can have the car for all I care. I just want the car out of my life.\n\nIf anyone wants to have this car and is capable of dealing with the boot (financially or otherwise), it\u2019s all yours. It\u2019s a 2010 Subaru legacy. It starts and drives (sans boot). It\u2019s got a fresh oil change. It\u2019s got some mechanical problems (blown head gasket, starting to be worn front brakes). \n\nYou can literally have it for free. The reduction in stress would be priceless to this yellow jacket right now. ",

I am in-state and I was thinking if I there is any way I could take classes at GSU to quickly finish all my humanities and history requirements. I didn't come in with credit for these and I feel like doing those over the summer at GSU will be easy and will help me take fewer classes when my coursework gets harder over the next couple of years. How does the application process work if I am able to do this and what you would suggest? Thank you for your time.",

I don't recommend doing them during the summer or at another school.\n\nIf anything, I'd take the hard core classes like Math and Science/Lab electives at a Georgia Perimeter college or GSU during the Summer instead since they'll be easier than doing them at Tech. And you'll get them out of your way. You'll want your hard classes during the main semesters to be only your major courses, adding hard sciences/math on top of that makes your life much harder than just having an easy humanity taking up space instead.",

I agree with the two longer posts: enthusiasm, professionalism, and someone who fits into our group's culture are the most important things for us.

Make sure the time you spend working will be productive and meaningful. Best of luck! And if you don't find a lab right away don't be discouraged.

So it is possible, but you'll have to come in with quite a few credit hours and take a higher than normal course load to do it (including some summer semesters). \n\nHopefully this advice isn't outdated. Also, other people might have different opinions, and YMMV.\n\nYou should make sure you genuinely enjoy both majors. I think the general consensus is that having a second undergrad degree doesn't make you more employable than having one undergrad degree + internship/co-op experience. So you probably shouldn't do this if your motivation is just to get a job (although maybe there are some niche jobs that need both EE and Math knowledge, idk for sure.)\n\nIf you can afford it, taking 4.5-5 years to double major might not be too bad, especially since you'll have a lower course load each semester. I don't think employers or grad schools will look at that too negatively.\n\nIn EE, you'll probably want to take classes in signal processing, control systems, and/or info theory as those are the more math heavy areas of EE. \n\nFinally, try not to take Real Analysis and Abstract Algebra in the same semester since those will likely have proof intensive homeworks due regularly. You don't want to pull two late/all nighters each week.\n\nThat's all the advice I can think of right now. Good luck!",

But if you're really interested in mathematics, and you're good at building intuition for math by yourself, and it's more recreational/curiosity based for you rather than based on career interests, I would just major in EE and learn the math on your own later on. The reason is that all the rigour and heavy workload in mathematics classes (or any subject for that matter) in my opinion doesn't translate well into *actual understanding* of the topic, just the ability to churn out results, with the drawback of having to do countless of exercises that the professors want you to do, rather than the ones that actually interest *you*. All the while, not giving you additional employability benefits. In fact, just putting down that you're interested in mathematics and read a lot on maths on your resume will already boost your chances of getting an EE job -- no need for that extra degree, unless the job specifically requires it. That will give you more time to learn mathematics in the way that interests *you*, and if you're talented this will actually be more productive and give you more long-term advantage.",

Clearly they have no consideration for anyone else on the hall, why do you need to consider whether you're throwing a wrench in their social plans? Why do they have the right to disturb the entire hall and boot you out of the room you are paying for with clear quiet hours? I've been on campus for 4 years and it is not a common issue to be kept up by strangers on the hall all night. Sometimes people are loud, sure, but that should be kept to a Friday night every couple months, not to the point of consistently disturbing your sleep. Since your RA isn't doing anything, you are well within your right to go ahead and escalate to the hall director. Shoot them an email. \n\nI had a similar issue with a roommate (not loud, but insisted on cranking the heat to 85 in the middle of the night all months of the year which makes it impossible for any rational person to sleep) and negotiating with them directly was fruitless, the RA kept deflecting and did nothing, a second RA also kept deflecting, but the hall director got something done. Only after I sacrificed almost an entire year of sleep trying to be considerate to a fucker who truly did not care about the wellbeing of anyone else until real consequences got involved \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Think wiffle ball on steroids. \n\nHere\u2019s a video of an example game\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8jH2JEL84Fo?si=DZhruFsvbEaZgM4B\n\nOur club rules will be slightly different, and we don\u2019t have massive dedicated mini-stadiums, but you get the idea.\n\nParticipation costs nothing, and we\u2019re looking to grow the sport in the area, so we plan to start slow and build up, so it\u2019s a perfect way to get off campus and meet new people, as well as something fun to do with friends!\n\nHere\u2019s the discord we\u2019re going to use to organize games\n\nhttps://discord.gg/cumjWrHX\n\nReach out if you have any questions; I hope to see you on the field!\n\n",

        "selftext": "I just got the email that my grad portrait pics from grad fest were ready. I go to the website and pick a package as I'm checking out and put in the promo code I got after registering for an account. It said invalid promo code, mind you the GradImages people were there giving out flyers that said register your account for a promo code. So I went to Google to look for a number to call and saw the reviews and wowwww, they have a 1.4-star rating with sooo many people complaining about never getting their pics in the mail or getting poor quality pics AND the promo codes not working. Why does GT still use these people?  Anyways, any recs for local studios in Atlanta for grad pics or local photographers because the reviews are off-putting, not gonna pay for that!!!  \n\n\nTLDR: GradImages seems to do bad business, please recommend some photographers and or local studios for grad pics.  \n ",

People seem to already have their own groups and are not willing to accept anyone new. I try to attend club events, but even then I still feel like a stranger and outsider from the various groups. Even when I try to converse with someone in my class, it just gets weird and they just sit somewhere else next time. I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll graduate soon and it\u2019ll be useless if it\u2019s like I was never even here or create any meaning memories, or have the proper college experience.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me or it\u2019s just the environment at Tech. When I was at GSU, I was a little successful in getting positive interactions and meeting girls but it\u2019s worse here. I have no hope for dating at all either. It gets lonely a little now that I\u2019m in dorms this semester, but I try to keep busy to not think about it as much.\n\nI might be complaining a little here, but I just wanted to know if anyone feels/felt the same way.

It\u2019s called \u201csocial dancing\u201d for a reason; there\u2019s no romantic subtext involved.\n\n(2) ORGT \u2014 outdoorsy people are generally quite outgoing. Maybe it\u2019s the sun. Go to some of their meetings, and maybe sign up for a trip or two. It\u2019s incredibly cheap and incredibly fun.\n\n(3) Intramural sports \u2014 there\u2019s random groups of people playing sports at STAMPS all the time. I met my best friends one Wednesday afternoon playing soccer. Just ask, and don\u2019t be afraid if some people say no. They won\u2019t remember you.",

Don't be standoffish, but don't immediately try to spend all your time with anyone either. Find enjoyment in the work and let your mutual passion help you form new connections.\n\nExamples of places where I found lifelong friends at GT:\n\n- Technique/Blueprint staff (working hard to get articles written and edited, photos taken and edited, etc.)\n- Orchestra (practice and rehearsal to perform)\n- Any team sport (practice and win competitions) - club sports in particular",

Early courses such as 1331 and 1332 are in person paper for instance (oop and data structures) and even 2110 sometimes is depending on the prof which is the basis for a lot of the more hands on courses.\n\nMath courses and other are all in person paper too.\n\nThere are ***some*** hybrid / online options, but the consensus is that you only register for those as a last resort imo since you're forced to learn solely online vs at least having the option of an inperson class and help if you sign up for in person sections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of us (myself included) are guilty of skipping and tbf it's entirely a valid option if you learn better alone, but for a lot of coures, you can't really have a better/faster time than with lectures and being able to talk to your profs and TAs. There tends to be a lot of internal mobility though beween sections of large courses (e.g. if im signed up for prof A in section A and I just decide to go to prof B's lectures cause i understand them better). It really depends a lot on your ability to force yourself to focus and work on your own, and the support network you build with friends and peers in the same classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImportant to note as well: a lot of core classes require attendance or something along those lines. E.g. from my experience:\n\n\\- Combinatorics\n\n\\- Psych\n\n\\- Probability and statistics\n\n\\- 2110 and 2200 (though tbf these can be done via reading the slides afterwards for lectures -- labs require physical tap in id card attendance sometimes)\n\n\\- etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of classes have recordings but an equal amount if not more don't.

I am a veteran so people say that is a lil bit of a boost during the acceptance process, but it\u2019s not a proven thing. I failed 3 courses at before transferring and the grades replaced by taking those courses again. I had a 3.84 GPA, no research or extracurricular activities linked to the school. I was able to technically apply using the REPP pathway and the veterans pathway but they accepted me under the REPP. I explained all of my circumstances about failing classes and I did do volunteer work as well as tutoring at the library for free since I was often there to study and my ex girlfriend was a tutor that would get swamped with students and needed extra help so all the students got tutored. They offered me a student tutoring position while I was there but I turned it down because I did to help not for money and if it became a job I wouldn\u2019t like doing it as much. I mentioned all this on my application as well as making several drafts for the application essays and having several people look through them to make sure they were top notch. I don\u2019t think my application was anything special, but I think your essays do matter a good bit because it\u2019s not just academic standing they are looking for. They want to make sure you are a good fit for GA Tech morally and ethically. As well as having drive and aspirations. You may have been waitlisted but don\u2019t give up!",

I am trying to get an idea of my financial situation, and have created a preliminary budget. \n\nI'll be making about $2600 a month after taxes, and the apartments I have looked at (1br) range from \\~1350-1450 a month. \n\nThe part I could use help on are the extra monthly fees that most apartments dont tell you until you apply. Specifically things like electricity, water, and gas usage. I know these depend on how much you actually use, but I am just trying to get a rough idea. Currently I have budgeted about $150/month for these costs. Is this reasonable ?\n\nAs a reference, In my current apartment I use about \\~200 kWh per month (for electricity). \n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqsdb186zylc1.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2414588893825434d05e599e7a7f80ac3f869b3",

If any of you saw a post I made earlier this week about a housing dilemma I had (ended up deleting it because I thought it was too niche of an issue), I got it resolved!\n\nAnyway, my actual post is about y'alls experience living in some of the on-campus apartments. My friends and I are rising 2nd years and are hoping to get into Crecine, but we wanted to have some backup options in case that doesn't happen. I currently live in NAV North (accoms), which has definitely been something (if you live here you already know LOL). Despite that, I do like the convenience of the dining hall being right there, and also having laundry. \n\nIf any of y'all have lived in the following apartments, please feel free to share what your experience was like! Just want ideas on which buildings to prioritize for backups.\n\n* NAV South, East\n* Crecine (#1 choice)\n* Zbar\n* GLC (since it's apparently for undergrads now?)\n* 8th Street\n* Center Street\n* Nelson-Shell\n* Maulding",

It makes it a pain in the ass if two people are cooking bc you have to do the weird squeeze behind thing, but in terms of everything else it's a solid building. I've heard decent things about Eighth and Z-Bar. Apparently Nelson Shell had roaches at one point? Could be hearsay.",

The interviews can even be designed to target specific skills that they need practice with.\n\nThe value for candidates is to help calm their nerves, build confidence and be prepared with answers for a comprehensive set of evaluation skills.  \nThe app is called RightJoin- [rightjoin.co](https://rightjoin.co/)\n\nIf anyone is in the job market and have interviews coming up, and you want to test my app for free, please DM me for the discount code. i would love and really appreciate some honest feedback from the gt community here.",

There were several supply chain issues that slowed this down.\n\n* We are also expecting 4 more treadmills to arrive any day now to help alleviate some of the broken ones.\n\n* Peter's parking deck is open. We are still process-improving on how things work out there. We've gotten great feedback thus far.\n\n* Ken Byers will have inconsistent hours now that NCAA tennis is in season. It is important to check the GTAA schedule before showing up for open play. \n\nAs always you can message me or reply to this thread - I do my best to reply here.\n\nIf you have any questions about our operations or other general CRC questions, please email us or visit our [website](https://www.crc.gatech.edu/).

More competition would only benefit the CoC.

So, for example, if you chose the Intelligence (AI) thread, you\u2019ll have to take your generic CS prerequisites and various general Ed. classes but then you get to take a handful of classes specific to AI like Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, etc. they give you like 9 options and usually you\u2019re required to take like 3 of them. And you get to choose two of these threads. I believe Computer Engineering does this too. But yeah, so they\u2019re releasing (dropping) a new Cybersecurity thread, that\u2019ll basically allow you to take 3 of these classes pertaining to Cybersecurity. I\u2019m not sure if these classes are new, but yeah, that\u2019s basically what I mean. A few of these classes are like, \u201cMalware Reverse Engineering,\u201d and, \u201cCyberwarfare,\u201d which sound insanely interesting. I hope explanation makes sense.",

Coming on here for some advice and insights into off campus housing.\n\nI\u2019m a rising senior, and like hundreds of other students, I have been pushed off campus for the 24-25 school year. This leaves me exploring my off campus options. I\u2019m looking at apartments preferably near east side of campus, and something fairly affordable as well. I am a first generation student, and navigating this situation on my own has been kinda difficult\ud83d\ude05\n\nMy current options are Uhouse, 100 midtown, standard, and the here. I also would need a parking spot, so that must be taken into account. Based on my research, Uhouse is the most affordable option, but it apparently has majorly gone downhill in the past year or so based on other Reddit posts and google reviews. Is it really as bad as everyone says it is? Are my other options fairly decent? Just looking for insights from current or previous residents. Which option is the best for me? Also, are there any other options that I\u2019m not considering?\n\nThanks guys ",

Their office was so annoying and its practically impossible to contact someone when you need to, also their utilities are also so expensive. I remember paying like $80 one month when at uhouse the max i've paid is $11\n\nOut of all your options, here is probably the best if money is not a huge concern but if it is then uhouse isnt as bad as everyone makes it out to be (its just not as nice as the other apts)",

When do recruitment start, where should we register, what is the process (how long and any details I need to know), and are there any fees? How competitive is the process? How much are the dues (and additional ones) for each sorority, and do they work on per-semester basis? Once accepted, do we need to reregister for the next semester? Is it mandatory to attend every events and parties, and what are the requirements to maintain your membership? What are advantages and disadvantages of joining? How are the houses, as in the building and facilities? Does each member get their own bedroom and a shared bathroom? Also, any thoughts on joining a sorority as an introvert?",

                "body": "The links here will answer a lot of your questions. [https://www.gatechcpc.com/welcome](https://www.gatechcpc.com/welcome)\n\nSorority membership is not a social club that you register for a semester at a time. Once initiated you are expected to be a member for all your undergrad years. Greek organizations are regarded as membership for life; when you graduate you become an alum member.\n\nA sorority, or fraternity, is only as good as everyone participating and contributing. \n\nTo maintain your membership you need to stay current on your dues, participate in all required activities, and keep your grades up. Dues are billed each semester and you really can't opt out for a semester unless you aren't in school. Plus there is a meal plan and everyone takes their meals at the house and the meal plans are pretty good plus it's a great way to meet others and get comfortable as a new member. Participation is required for weekly meetings, philanthropic events, and most sisterhood events and socials unless you have a valid excuse.  Sorority membership is not really a drop in kind of thing, you need to be committed, but you will get far more out of it if you throw yourself into the opportunities.\n\nEach member does not live in the house, only about 1/3 - 1/2 the membership lives in plus exec officers are required. First years never live in the house. The rooms are a roommate situation, not singles, and there are common bathrooms for everyone on a floor.\n\nThe big advantage is friendship. You will not like everyone but most members find their group of close friends. That's what it's all about. Relationships in a Greek organization are really like a bell curve: you will love and be close with a small group, you will like and respect most of the other members to a certain degree, and there will be some that you really don't care for at all if not can't stand. But that's life. There will be members in your major and in your classes that you can study with, there will be members involved in clubs and orgs all over campus and can help you get involved too if you want. If you want leadership experience there are many offices you can run for, you will learn how to run a formal meeting efficiently (a great skill) and you will hopefully develop skills to get along with all kinds of personalities. You will also meet and make friends in other sororities and fraternities, as well as their friends who aren't in Greek life.\n\nIf you are an introvert you may find recruitment difficult. You need to hold up your end of a social conversation and show your best personality and appearance, and not just answer questions with short answers. Too many PNM's equate recruitment as an interview process but it's not at all, it's a process to find best fit. Each house has a slightly different vibe and a culture. Sororities are social organizations and social skills are important. After recruitment it is important to try to make friends in your new member class. Meetings and meals help with this, plus you can hang out at the house when you aren't in class. You don't have to be a gregarious person necessarily, but you might need to get out of your comfort zone at first and then it gets easier.",

The 8 NPC sororities actually really are far more alike than different, with around 175-200 members in each one. \n\nWhat anyone thinks of each group's vibe or culture or characteristics is completely dependent on their own personal lens, the individuals they happen to interact with, and the influence from other's personal opinions.  \n\nRecruitment is in person for a reason. The only way to get a feel for the different sororities is through meeting and talking to members.  This is why fall formal recruitment is the best time to consider joining because you get to meet some members in all houses at least once.\n\nYou also need to keep in mind that recruitment is a two-way process; the sororities will be making their own determination about the PMN's 'vibes' as well, and while you may decide you think you like the vibe of certain sororities best, those chapters may think that other PNM's are a better fit for them. In that case they would release you and you would need to focus on your other options. \n\nTLDR; you can't go through recruitment before you go through recruitment. Keep an open mind and don't think you can predetermine a certain house for yourself.",

Yes there are required things you go to each semester, but if you have serious conflicts (classes, jobs, etc.) most will try to work with you. Like you would expect anywhere, you'll be really close to a subset and maybe not know others as well. But the support I have felt from those I didn't realize knew my name has been incredible. From day 1 I had people offering to help me study, plan schedules for classes, and a group who would consistently bring me dinner across campus when I had evening classes just to make sure I would eat something. Greek life may not be a great fit for everyone, but if you're curious, take a look at the CPC guide, watch some of the GT sorority sisterhood videos on youtube, and rush. You can always back out of rush, COB at a later date, or join a chapter and then drop before initiation if it's not a right fit for you.",

Like seriously, you can't tell me tofu costs more than beef, I know how much they cost. Maybe these fake meat options should be replaced with protein like tofu or beans that aren't as expensive or something? Because just having vegetables as the only affordable option is ridiculous.

In terms of my experiences,\n\n1. Cooking so so valuable. You save money and you can start simple. If you have a pan, you can always make a run to Publix to get a lotta veggies (different colors), pasta, sauce and whip up your \"mostly homemade pasta\"\n\n2. In terms of protein, tofu has been a valuable asset. I personally am into making curries. An easy way could be to get some veggies, tofu, and thai curry paste (yellow, red, etc) and whip up a beautiful thai curry in minutes. You can enjoy with rice! Also, my roommate and I also like to make quesadillas with refried black beans, veggies, taco seasoning, taco sauce, some chilli powders, cheese and its also not as difficult if you put your mind to it\n\nThe point is that sometimes we gotta get a bit creative and realize that there are options if you actively try them out!\n\n3. In terms of food options if you dont have time to cook or unable to, below are a list of places that could work (according to my experience + vegetarian friends' experiences). Not exahustive by any means:\n\n* Chipotle\n* Rreal tacos\n* Lucky Buddha\n* Govindas Cafe (they deliver to campus if you join their whatsapp group. very affordable)\n* Food terminal\n* Mamouns Falafel\n* Gyro Bros\n* Sometimes there's this place called Marrakech Express that comes to campus to serve lunch. Price point and food really good\n*",

I wish they'd use those here rather than these more expensive alternatives. Because at the end of the day, it's not exactly a \"good option\" if nobody can reasonably afford it, especially on a college campus. I'm just venting my frustrations but yeah, it's the south, probably isn't going to change :(",

It's disheartening for food truck owners to see the never ending line for Slutty Vegan while it takes an act of congress for students to look in your direction. \n\nSee the running theme? Actions speak louder than words and when people don't patronize XYZ, they're going to change the format to whatever people will patronize. \n\nThe Slutty Vegan situation is complicated so I'll leave it at this: their food truck was the MOST successful food truck to set foot on campus. Now that they're here permanently, everybody hates them. I don't get it.",

JJ is similar to others as they have no protein, it's still just vegetables. I like Subway because they have those patties and places like Panera have eggs, taco bell has beans, etc (for an affordable price too).\n\nAnd I totally get your point with Slutty Vegan. Maybe it's their good marketing (like wow there's a burger named sloppy toppy? That's crazy, I gotta check that out!) But now since we have it here permanently, I think it's easier to see that each burger is 20 dollars which trumps their brand. Honestly, I'm not sure how well Slutty Vegan is doing, I'm assuming not well because it burns through everyone's wallets, but I could be wrong. I'd be curious to know though.",

There are numerous vegetarian Caribbean, Indian, and Chinese places as well as vegan pizza and central/South American food in the city which isn't reflected in on campus options. I agree there should be something other than Slutty Vegan which is good but cost prohibitive and uninteresting to have regularly compared to the wealth of options for those without dietary restrictions",

Coding should be pretty straightforward but I remember exam 2 usually has one or two Tree-related coding questions that\u2019s not a direct HW method so just look at the past exams and you\u2019ll see patterns in the solutions to tree-based problems.\n\nSecond tip is to practice, practice, practice. Come up with a data structure and practice adding an element to it, removing an element, etc. Then check your work with CS Vistool. \n\nThe Big O questions were the hardest in my opinion, since they were the trickiest. Here the main tip I have is to write out the worst case time complexities for all operations of all data structures (e.g. adding to external chaining hashmap) and study that.",

However, getting only negative feedback with zero positive reinforcement isn\u2019t exactly balanced constructive criticism, and I\u2019d hope it\u2019s not the norm in the real world.\n\nFor example, we were meeting with a faculty member seeking advice on the valuation section of our report asking whether we should explain a high-level framework or be more granular and try to execute the valuation and produce numbers. She said that without fail, the examiners will be disappointed either way. You\u2019re damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be a baby, but I hope it\u2019s understandable that it\u2019s not super validating to do a project given unclear expectations and being told that no matter how hard you\u2019ll try, you\u2019ll always be a disappointment. It honestly makes me want to put in less effort since we\u2019ll be a disappointment either way. \n\nI\u2019d love to hear if alumni look back on Senior Design thinking it\u2019s more or less intense than the real world and if they felt they\u2019d actually learned applicable skills in this class ",

They want to be as harsh, but they're not as connected with the project and they don't have the time to add nuance and positive feedback. I was lucky because my team's advisor did a good job of meeting with us after the interim and translating the pure criticism into something constructive (if still harsh, we were objectively behind at that point).\n\nBecause of that, I personally had a great experience, but if you don't have a faculty member on your side like that, I'd say just keep you head down, take your passing grade, and get out.\n\ntldr:\n\nGood advisor: ignore the haters and have fun doing a cool project\n\nBad advisor: just get out",

Teams feel like the feedback is \"rating their performance\" while the faculty are just trying to give clear, candid feedback based on their experience in industry.\n\nIt can feel harsh, even brutal, but we would be doing a disservice to any students by not giving them clear feedback.\n\nGetting feedback that hurts to hear doesn't mean you aren't doing a great job! Generally you get good, detailed feedback when you're doing a good job. Even if it's not fun to hear. If you get little to no feedback, that's when you should really be worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you think you're going to get kinder feedback given in a way that's easier to hear in industry.. you won't.",

He didn't tell us how it was wrong or what could be fixed. We confirmed with our Accounting notes and the CFO of the client's company, and the formula was correct. I've also heard stories of ISYE faculty getting so angry that they storm out of the room during a presentation.

Great talent will only want to come to GT if they have a competitive program and a pro-style offense (with rare exceptions, GT has a tough time getting offensive skill positions into the league and it's usually just trenches guys).\n\nPaul Johnson did the best with what he had but we will continue to struggle as long as our Athletics department refuses to gets real and smart about their strategy to challenge UGA meaningfully.\n\nWe are a harder school than UGA - that is both a positive and negative. You can go farther in life with a degree from GT (on average) than a degree from UGA. So that should be an advantage when recruiting talent. BUT GT is hard and if a top talent is focused on playing college football and then going pro, then they don't (and probably shouldn't) focus on too much else other than football. Why would they put themselves through the stress of weed-out engineering classes when they could be racing cars after strip club visits in Athens?\n\nIdeally we would want to recruit athletes that are up for the challenge academically but also talented on the field. That unique subgroup of athletes typically make the best pro players anyway (professionalism, game IQ etc.). Stanford and Michigan are both academically challenging schools but are able to recruit well because they have a firm strategy on *who* to recruit.\n\nGT sells itself in terms of the quality of the degree, location, program history etc. It's in a big conference as well. The problem is our team doesn't have the vision or the belief that it can create a culture of high performing athletes that won't just get destroyed by UGA. It would take a big personality that comes from a culture of winning and understands the nuance and history of GT Football, that could create pull and get us up to the floor of talent necessary to challenge for a ranked spot consistently. One good hire can be the difference maker. I doubt we will see that though. The athletics department is too narrow-minded/focused on short term appointments, when, in reality, no one ever truly believes that we will win a CFB championship from year to year when in reality it should be totally possible.",

When I was learning data science, I did attend an online presentation and they went over the job titles for different roles (analyst, data scientist, data engineer, ML researcher, etc.) but it was still hard to understand the distinctions until I read lots of job postings, and I sent out multiple resumes for jobs with different titles that were not really matches (HR could probably tell right away).

Self-care in general is a really good idea before any high-stakes/high-pressure situation, and tests are no different.\n\nDuring the exam, force yourself to slow. down. Make a pact with yourself to read every question twice. For problem set type tests, commit to checking your answers once you get them. It's often possible to verify that the answer you got is reasonable; this will let you catch misinterpreting the question. Practice these behaviors with the practice exams.\n\nWhen you take the practice exams, do you do a mock test? Give yourself a time limit, and the same resources available for the real exam? It is very easy to think \"oh, I've got this\" after flipping through a practice exam with the answers written out. But it sounds like your issues are more with \"how to test\" than with the core material; reading the answer key isn't helpful for those problems but practicing taking the test is!",

However, I'm uncertain if this is something I want to commit to 100%, considering I might want to change professions in the future or focus on a different area.\n\nIf I decide that I no longer want to pursue this field, would it be acceptable or professionally ethical to resign or not return after a semester? The employment is not binding. I'm genuinely excited about this career opportunity, and it seems interesting, but I'm very unsure whether I will enjoy it or want to shift my focus.\n\nAdditionally, it's at GTRI, so would leaving have any effect on my opportunities at GT?

If you decide you don\u2019t want to return to the same position, just tell them you very much like GTRI but are interested in [insert discipline] and interested in other opportunities within GTRI to pursue that. If you demonstrate that you\u2019re smart and motivated, your manager could be a reference to another position within GTRI. \n\nTechnology careers are more fluid than you may think in terms of disciplines. I started as a software engineer but have also run lead the cybersecurity programs for a start up, managed IT/help desk, been a business analyst, project manager, lead infrastructure and devops teams, and more. Knowing how all the different disciplines work together can help you architect better solutions and better build and organize teams.",

I think the group was called GT \u201824 or something but basically you would make a post introducing yourself or reply to other posts or just lurk. My post got a looooot of attention like it became one of the most popular posts on there \ud83e\udee8 so my now boyfriend didn\u2019t bother approaching me\n\nBut it also hit him at 2 am when I got an Instagram DM from him randomly\n\nHis line was \u201cI heard you like anime, wanna be friends? \ud83d\ude05\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 we laugh at it together now\n\nI had a boyfriend at that time and of course, we didn\u2019t know each other irl so all that came out of it was him sending me random reels that were not my humor or interest \ud83e\udd2a\n\nWe were totally online our first year. When we finally got to campus sophomore year, we met up the second day of moving in (still before classes) and he introduced me to a group of people he knew that is now our friend group that has amassed about 30 people from GT :D and we\u2019re all close\n\nHe found out that I was single and then he started to get flirtier (? LOL idk what was happening it was a blur) for two weeks\n\nAnd then he confessed to me at the CRC (which was set up by our friends) he started the conversation off by asking me relationship questions \ud83e\udee3 and then asked if I know who he liked\n\nAnd then he pulled out his phone and it was our DM\u2019s HAHA so cute \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\n\nand we are still together now and he sends me cute reels of animals and calls me a rat\n\nTL;DR: shoot your shot :)",

I found out later there'd been a silane gas leak in one of the labs. Anyway, I had time to kill, so I was just standing there watching the spectacle. This guy walked by on the sidewalk, and we realized we recognized each other from Pride lunches, so we said hi and started chatting. He was a transfer student and was feeling gloomy about doing badly in classes and possibly needing to drop one. I reassured him this was normal at Tech and dropping a class doesn't mean you're a failure. We had a nice chat for 15 minutes or so and then parted ways.\n\nSoon after, he realized we might never meet again, so he tracked me down through mutual friends in Pride Alliance, we exchanged messages, and arranged a date. The story goes on, but TLDR we've been together 14 years and finally tied the knot a few years ago.",

Instantly attracted. Didn't do anything, though, and moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to end of fall semester 2005, and instead of studying I decide to trawl Facebook (still TheFacebook at the time). Found out that this girl also happened to know another friend of mine from classes freshman year. I asked said friend to introduce us. She agreed and held a party right after finals at her apartment in 6th Street. F and I met, found out we lived in Woodruff North together. We chatted every now and again, and in May 2006 after finals F's roommate asked F for some alone time with her then-boyfriend (a uga grad, ugh). So F and I got to hang out for a bit.\n\nWe went on our first date the summer of 2006. It went well, we did an impromptu extension, ended up having some chemistry. Went on a second date and met her younger sister and her now-husband (that was quick). I thought things were getting serious. So I tried to determine the relationship (does that term still exist?). F said she doesn't want to be in a serious relationship because she just got out of a long one with a not-so-great guy. Well shit.\n\nBut I wouldn't take no for an answer! Fall 2006 started, and we continue casual dating. It slowly gets more and more serious, and in fall 2007 I lavaliere her. We graduate December 2008, and for Christmas we get engaged. Finally got married in 2012, and now we're working on raising the next generation of Tech grads.\n\nEven if it's a remote opportunity, pursue those opportunities!",

After they approve your application, they will send you an email and submit other documents and notify career center on your behalf. You will receive another email after that for the application fee of $30. That is all you have to do. After a week or two, you will get an email saying that a new I-20 with CPT authorization has been issued for you. You will, then, go to iStart to check if all the information is right, accept the new I-20, and download it. That is all.",

Here\u2019s some of the pros and cons I can think of off the top of my head\n\nPros:\n- In state tuition (if you\u2019re out of state) (no additional out of state fees like you would see if you do undergrad)\n- cost of living (rent particularly) is cheaper\n- smaller classes so you get to know your professors well\n- you get to go abroad (they only do classes M-R so you can take long weekends to travel)\n- registration (particularly first semester) is WORLDS less stressful than your first semester as a MS student on Atlanta campus. Classes rarely fill up at GT-E compared to the madhouse that is ATL Phase-2 registration\n- Applying to BS/MS on GTE campus gets you a much faster acceptance than the ATL campus (~2-4 weeks vs ~2-4 months depending on when you apply) and is pretty much a guaranteed acceptance as long as you meet GPA requirements- I\u2019ve heard rumblings that this is no longer the case for ATL campus applications but haven\u2019t confirmed\u2026\n\nCons:\n- Course selection can be a bit slim but they have it posted on their website ahead of time so you can see if they offer stuff you\u2019re interested\n- (pro tip on the class registration: if you see an online class taught in the online campus/shenzen campus you can probably convince them to give you a waiver to take that class)\n- long time away from home\n- language barrier can be a bit rough when dealing with administrative stuff (getting housing, a visa, etc) but once you\u2019re in the city people are very nice and accommodating if you make an attempt to speak French. \n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s more I am missing, so ask me any questions- I can see what advice I can give. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s a great experience I would say. Though it is dependent on how social you are willing to be. I went with friends from undergrad, so that helped me a lot. If you do the BSMS program, you only have to stay there for one semester (obvs you could do it your whole time there too if you like). If you do it through just a plain MS you would have to spend 2 semesters there. Great opportunity to travel and see loads of Europe. Would recommend if studying abroad has been something of interest.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI was offered the Talent Initiative Transfer Pathway Program for gatech for Fall of 2025. I've got the gist of what the program is understood, but I just wanted to ask here on this subreddit on what other people's experiences were? Is there some catch to the program, or something I should look out for? I just wanted to know what exactly i'm getting myself into before I start to pick courses that would transfer to gatech at my other school. \n\nFor some background, I'm OOS, and am planning to major in Aerospace Engineering, which gatech is world renowned for. During application season, gatech was my dream school, and some place that I really wanted to go to, but knew it would be hard for me because of me being OOS. I'm sort of adamant on attending gatech now that I have a garunteed chance (as long as I dont slack off my first year), so I really wanted to know about some personal experiences on the program. \n\ntldr: is transferring in through the talent initiative transfer pathway program worth it?

I\u2019ve made B\u2019s in 2020 and 2026, and a C in 2036. I also believe I\u2019ll get a B in 2031. \n\nI chose EE because I enjoyed Physics 2 in HS and wanted to do Power Systems. However, going through Tech, I feel that I am consistently doing mid in all these ECE courses and it\u2019s somewhat killing my interest for the major.\n\nI\u2019m considering switching to ME but I am still unsure.

Of course, you don't need to know exactly what that is. As a second year, it's hard to really know/understand all the options you have. However, I would recommend sitting down with someone or multiple people, preferably someone with more experience (ex. upperclassmen), or own your own and asking what you think you're interested in and why. (Feel free to DM me. I'm a 4th year, former ME who's now EE.)\n\nWhile grades are important to an extent, they aren't always make or break. (They definitely are in some cases when scholarships and entry jobs have GPA cutoffs, but people will definitely stop caring at some point.) I would also suggest reaching out to other classmates, TAs, professors, friends, and school provided tutoring (ECE is starting to offer some for some of those classes, flyers in Van Leer) if you are struggling. Good chance your peers have also have/had the same issues and if not they should be able to help you. You don't and shouldn't have to do this alone. It's going to be hard at times, but I know people who were struggling to pass in some of those early classes who were making high Bs to As consistently by the time they graduated. They put in a lot of work on their side not being too bothered by the grades constantly asking when they weren't clear on anything in office hours or with friends/classmates.",

All advanced studies are difficult in their own way because you\u2019re learning more than rote memorization, you\u2019re developing intuition and a framework for understanding. You\u2019re paying to be in college, so make more out of it than a 4.0 transcript.",

Equipment is expensive, editing takes time, and you're valuable :)!\n\nEdit: as this event is tmmrw, you won't be able to rent a library camera in time... But def would recommend for future events.",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a former employee at GATech, who filed an HR report on the EthicsPoint system in accordance to the university policy about unethical advisor behavior. In the very beginning of the process after I filed, they told me that, even before any investigative action is taken, and even if I choose to withdraw now:\n\nA) My confidential report will be made into public record, as per the Georgia Open Records act.  \nB) The person I am alleging advisor abuse against, will be notified of the information.\n\nI was told that this would happen independent of any choice I make now including to withdraw the complaint, even though the case has not yet begun beyond them contacting me and having a short Microsoft Teams meeting with me / receiving my complaint.  The EthicsPoint site I submitted the report to said that the information would be \"confidential\" (source: Ethicspoint Navex terms and conditions). This seems to be directly violated by A, B given that I cannot withdraw according to the HR employee I spoke to, and no where in their terms and conditions or their website was this clearly indicated.\n\nA and B combined means that sensitive personal details of my complaint will be unmasked to the person I am complaining against, which includes information about people who can corroborate my story, who I would prefer not be known to the complainee due to retaliation potential.  There is also personal information that I would prefer not be made public (although if it is, the world doesn't end for me).\n\nI have already considered seeking legal advice, and may pursue it if there are no further options at the university. I aware of the 50-18-72 carveout of the Georgia Open Records act.  I do not believe i was informed about the Open Records Act prior to filing a report that was called \"confidential\", nor was I informed that I would have no way to stop the process and no way to prevent the complainee to be informed even if I wanted to back out of the process.\n\nI was wondering if there was any advice besides for seeking legal representation, to prevent the publication of highly sensitive personal information about witnesses and more.   I am looking into legal representation, and look forward to a chance to exercise my rights.\n\nPS: I am happy speaking to anyone of the details of the case, including my name and information about the case (and the complainee), in private message.",

Your base rent might be cheap but even before adding power and water that's already like 100/mo in just bullshit fees.\n\nI'm beginning to think shitty leasing offices are sort of normal in this area though unfortunately, can't find any apartments that don't have people who will say the same about theirs.",

Only in mass layoffs after they've succumbed to lifestyle creep do a lot of people really start to understand how fucked up life can get, or if they get some sort of chronic illness themselves. A lot of people need a reality check like this to happen. I just happened to have that reality check happen over and over again during my climb up the academic ladder that is GT and trying to find a job after graduation.\n\nExpecting people who are in positions of privilege like that to show an ounce of compassion for someone navigating a situation that most would struggle with turns out to be a really big ask.

It reads exactly like faculty training materials on disgruntled male students prone to disrespect/violence.

It can destroy organizations from the inside out. Smart individuals step in when they see lazy work leading to negative impacts, and for someone to be an instructor and not have the ability or thoughtfulness to step in to a situation where negative work is being directly addressed by a student ( or at least squelch their worries about it affecting their grade ) that is a huge issue.\n\nWhen you experience that level of apathy, you might hold onto it as well.\n\nEdited the post to leave out her name since it's so concerning to you.",

Along with the acceptance, I've been offered a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) position with an annual stipend of approximately $35k. \n\nAs this is a significant step in my academic journey, I want to make informed decisions moving forward. I'm reaching out to this community for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. Is a $35k/year stipend in line with what's typically offered for Physics GTA positions at GT (or similar institutions)? I want to ensure this offer is competitive and fair.\n\n2. Does anyone have experience or advice on negotiating GTA stipends? Is it common or even advisable to try to negotiate this aspect of a graduate offer?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

For reference, the highest is ISyE, BME, and one of the CS schools that pay up to 40K. \n\nBut to answer your questions, it's a very competitive offer at least based on the price levels of Atlanta and you can already get a really nice apartment. And no, I don't think you can negotiate your stipend, and Ph.D. programs do not work that way (I assume you are not from the US in this case).",

Some of those lists have many people on them (undergrad, male) while others have very few (grad, GIH). So, it's possible that someone who filled out the form at 1:30pm might have a relatively low position number, if they are on one of the shorter lists.\n\nHOWEVER, that does not mean they have a better chance at getting off their waitlist. People will be offered a space as it becomes available for their classification and gender. If a space can be used for multiple classifications/genders, the original survey timestamp order will be used to fill the space.",

In general, the number of spaces allocated for the different classifications is pre-determined and primarily driven by demand. So, the longer lists have more people, but they also have more beds allocated to them, and vice versa. Ultimately, it depends on how things like cancellations play out over the next few months, so I cannot predict either way, but the person in your scenario might see a slight improvement or they might see the opposite. It should not be meaningful in either direction though, and we'll be monitoring the velocity of each list closely to make sure that is the case. Therefore, I would recommend that person stays on whichever list would potentially provide them the most comfortable living arrangement if they were to get off the waitlist. (Instead of switching for a perceived advantage or in an attempt to game the system.)",

                "body": "Last year 1,665 people got off the waitlist for on-campus housing ([source](https://youtu.be/CE9KWP0sm7o?si=RcVmS6T07SC2-Ze4&amp;t=371)), so it's likely that you're going to get off the waitlist it's just about when and if it's worth worrying about it. There's also the Waitlist Priority Consideration [form](https://housing.gatech.edu/applicants/faqs#WhatisWaitlistPriorityConsiderationandhowdoesitwork), which I think opens in March but you won't be given priority until July which makes no sense but it's better than nothing if you need on-campus housing for financial reasons, disability, or other factors.\n\nThe most important thing is making sure that you have a worst-case scenario that you can be okay with. If you are waiting for on-campus housing, you need to have a plan for what you'll do if you don't get it since this will allow you not to worry as much and to make sure you have somewhere to live. These worst-case scenarios can be:\n\n* Commuting if that's an option for you\n* Living in an unfurnished apartment that isn't a \"student apartment\", you can get good rates if living with at least one roommate and you can live there until you graduate and you can sign a lease in July or August if needed\n* Finding somewhere last minute to live with people you might not know which will likely be in Home Park or farther from campus (the [GT Housing Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GeorgiaTechSubleasesRoommates/) is a good place for this)\n* Signing somewhere off-campus and trying to find someone to sublease if you get on-campus housing (finding a sublease isn't guaranteed though)\n* Subleasing from someone only for the Fall and trying to get on-campus housing again in the Spring (it'll open in October) since you basically can't get back on-campus once you live off campus unless you live on-campus again only in the Spring\n\nWhile none of these are ideal, it's likely that you'll get off the waitlist and you have options if you don't, so just make sure that you have a solid backup plan so you that don't have to worry while waiting for the waitlist. Good luck :)",

Join the waitlist or DM me if you're a curator or if you've ever thought about content curation. You can make lists like [https://www.curatelists.xyz/explore](https://www.curatelists.xyz/explore) in less than a few minutes.\n\nWe're currently in alpha, so would love some more early adopters. Thanks!",

                "body": "Interesting idea. I'd pose it as a generalized \"playlist\" creator rather than \"content curation platform\" which is a clunky mouthful. You call it \"curate lists\" but who cares about \"curation\" - anyone who likes things should be able to use the tool, regardless of whether they view themselves as a \"curator\" or not. And most people don't.\n\nI guess your idea is to approve curators first, but then you have the issue of trusting your curators as tastemakers. It doesn't make sense. Lists that are \"curated\" by your network aren't a draw to your platform. If I were you, I'd open it up to everyone, but I'd also create lists based off of established, public lists. Barack Obama publishes his list of books every year - use that, and you don't have to get Obama to DM you to have him as a curator. Same goes for many artists who publicly list their influences. Start there, build a userbase, then reach out directly to tastemakers who already have a platform.\n\nThere's a huge friction issue with waitlists. If someone's interested, you're turning a user away, and they probably won't come back. If you're truly in an alpha, let people sign up and figure it out. The more data the better. You're not taking money.\n\nAs for the tech, this is entirely on the frontend and very slow. If you click on \"explore,\" you have a flash of \"no trending list found\" before it finally loads all the data. You're leaking your firebase SDK info. Your lighthouse performance score is abysmal, and I could absolutely feel it on first load of even your homepage. If you want to stick to React, highly recommend Remix or Astro, but even Next.js will give you a huge performance boost at this stage.",

This is definitely very useful, and I encourage people to take a look at what you posted.\n\nHowever, the group I'm making is not exclusively the discussion aspect. To be clear, I'm not claiming that this is a substitute for therapy, or pretend that I know a lot about psychology. But gathering people with similar experiences can't possibly hurt.\n\nThe main differences are that there will be a social aspect. I was thinking about organizing things like campfires, challenges, trips, mini-debates, and all kinds of social events.\n\nAlso, on the more philosophical side, I feel like anxiety and loneliness are increasingly common, and it's all nice that we have facilities to handle mental health on the campus, but many communities don't. Part of running this experiment is to see how making a local group like this can be helpful, and to create a model that could be replicated in communities all over the place. \n\nSome of the more philosophical aims of this are: A. encourage people who are resistant to go to therapy, as many people have inner stigma and shame for going to therapy, B. provide an alternative for people who don't have resources to go to therapy, C. relieve therapists in an ever-increasing mental health epidemic. The best treatment for anxiety is really exposure to what you're afraid of, and a lot of people simply need encouragement and accountability for going beyond their comfort zone; there is no need for psychological expertise for the exposure aspect alone, and exposure by itself is incredibly powerful.",

I don't see how I'm playing a psychologist, because a lot of exposure therapy is also what parents, family, and friends are for. You don't need therapists just to get a net of people who will encourage you to grow as a person. An example from parenting: a child wants to approach other children and play but is afraid, the parent encourages them to go play; an example from friendships: a guy wants to ask out a girl he likes but is afraid, a good friend has their back and encourages them to do it.\n\nThe purpose of this club is to encourage people to try to expose themselves to the things they *want* to experience but are afraid of, step by step. This cannot possibly hurt because people are specifically pursuing things they want to achieve, but didn't have the necessary encouragement. It's goal driven; it's not meant to be a program to eliminate anxiety altogether because it is not clear to me how to do that. But it is true that exposure makes a person braver, and shows a person that they can do more than the thought they can.\n\nOf course, exposing oneself to their frights too radically can be more regressive than helpful. That's why it's important that it is *voluntary* exposure after all, and done in thoughtful moderation. There is no need to have a masters degree here. Besides, I'm not planning to be some kind of \"psychological leader\" more than just an organizer of events where people can try to figure things out on their own. If it makes you happy, I will make people sign waivers that this is not substitute for professional therapy, and that they should enter this club with no expectations. Cheers.",

Person had a panic attack in the break room and ended up in the ER, was fired shortly after for \"unrelated\" performance issues. Person has not been able to find full-time work since and their anxiety has only worsened despite now being in treatment.\n- Person with fear of heights was encouraged to go to higher and higher locations. Person never tried to tolerate their distress, just go and do it and leave. Person ended up being anxious about leaving the ground floor until they entered treatment.\n- Person had anxiety about throwing things away (not trash/hoarding). Person was encouraged to have someone go through things with them for support. Instead of learning to tolerate the anxiety, person became completely dependent on having others make decisions for them until they entered treatment.\n\nShould I go on?\n\nIf you don't have a clinical understanding of what is going on, you're at a risk of providing the wrong kind of encouragement, taking too big a step, becoming an enabler.

To add to that, the class can put you behind in your course schedule due to pre reqs.\n\nYour probably going to have to take useless classes at some point in GT (humanities, English, social sciences, etc).

GT is my dream school but I want to ask some questions about some reservations that I have about going to Tech.\n\n1. I've heard the culture at Tech is pretty cutthroat. Is that true? I attended a small liberal arts university for my undergrad and I really enjoyed the collaborative environment there, and I'm worried about going to a school that's a lot bigger and that has a reputation like Tech does. I don't back down from academic challenge (because I'm pursuing a PhD!) but I also don't want to feel like I'm doing it alone.\n2. I have heard the qualifying exam pass rate is 50% and that it is brutal even compared to quals at other top AE programs. Is this accurate?\n3. How is the housing situation for grad students? When should I start searching for apartments if I want to begin leasing in August? Any areas that grad students tend to live - and conversely, any areas to avoid like the plague?\n\nThanks so much!!! I'm so excited",

I feel that PhD students are quite insulated from the overall \u201cschool\u201d culture per se, and it\u2019s really more your program/cohort/lab that defines the environment you\u2019ll be working in. So like my cohort in ChBE was quite welcoming/cooperative, but best to talk to someone in AE\n\n2. Talk to someone in AE\n\n3. Housing is pretty much going to be all off-campus as you might expect (though there are on-campus options too). I think timewise you could start looking anytime now through early spring, though definitely don\u2019t have to sign anything this soon (although if that would put your mind at ease then thats fair enough). \n\nA lot of people I know live in Midtown, Home Park, Atlantic Station, or further out, but that depends on your budget/transportation situation/willingness to travel. Home Park is pretty cheap but is your more typical run-down college houses kinda thing; apartments in midtown are close but can get expensive; stuff like that. \n\nNo particular notes on where to avoid as I don\u2019t have much experience with other areas but midtown/home park/atlantic station are all decent. Worthwhile looking around at apartment reviews and other posts on this sub about housing as well",

Each lab is different though so while I didnt experience many of these issues ymmv depending on the lab. No matter the program you choose you will feel like you are going at it alone at some point. I have friends that went to different programs and they too had phases of their program that were difficult and deeply lonely.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n2. The AE program is known for having the hardest quals in the university. However the pass rate accounting for both tries is anywhere from 70-90% depending on the cohort from what I was told and observed\u00a0\n\n\n3. Housing can be tough. See if you can connect with other students coming into the lab/department for roommates and you will be fine. Start looking in March/April to get the lay of the land but a lot of apartments have 60 notice periods so they won't post apartments open for August move in until May/June.\u00a0",

Question 2 is for you to ask someone in the AE program although my roommates can attest to that brutality LMAO (they are 5th year doctoral candidates in AE program). \n\nFor question 1, if you are coming from a LAC (I assume LAC as in like Williams, Amherst, Swarthmore, etc.), expect a cultural shift. GT Ph.D. students are more or less insulated from the rest of the school (by the rest of the school, I mean undergraduates and masters) UNLESS you are a GTA, where you have to interact with non-doctoral students. \n\nYes, there's a collaborative culture, but DO NOT EXPECT your peers to be extremely well-rounded with regard to other aspects (I myself went to a LAC and GT was more academic-focused). After all, you are here to do research, research, and research (with caveats). \n\nWhether you are doing a ph.d. in aerospace or any program, this is GT and learn to be persistent FIRST before you come here in the Fall (or else, you won't like it when the reality hits you). And sadly, loneliness is also real and that's something I and my peers across different programs suffer; but this is not unique to GT. \n\nFor question 3, I don't know about your stipend situation, but look for apartments near school (someone else mentioned Midtown and Homepark already) and I am saying this from my personal experience; in my first year, I lived like 60-90 min commute using MARTA bus and trains, and it crushed my mental health (and to this day, I am still recovering because while the location is safe since it's a recently gentrified area, it was too isolated). Fun fact, I once saw a guy rolling weed, casually putting down his pistol and a broken HP monitor during summer on MARTA.\n\nNevertheless, I do enjoy my life here and I would not trade anywhere even though I trash GT occasionally because that's my beer time conversation (ok maybe except for 1-2 other schools).",

                "body": "I am a PhD student in one of the big AE labs. To address the questions:\n\n1. The grad community is not cutthroat at all. Many people mature in high school, and almost all mature in undergrad. The most cutthroat you'll find is the few bootlickers who will openly argue to the AE faculty that the PhD stipends should *not* be raised (despite being the lowest stipends at GT). Academically, the community here is delightful, especially if you are taking classes with your labmates.\n\n2. The AE quals are archaic and systemically disadvantage students from smaller labs. The big labs (ASDL, SSDL) pair you with senior students to ensure you are prepared for quals and have banks of previous years' questions for study material. Smaller labs don't have that. The quals are challenging, and you'll lose 6-12 months of research output studying for them, but they are doable. The previously mentioned bootlickers defend the AE quals because they gatekeep \"personalities\" that aren't suited for an AE PhD.\n\n3. There is a housing group on Facebook that is popular.\n\nBeyond your questions, I strongly recommend that you reconsider GT AE. The department has a strong reputation, however seriously lags behind other departments, especially in the post-Covid world. GT AE ranks dead last in PhD stipend relative to cost of living for the top 10 AE PhD programs in the US, even behind other GT departments (CS, IC pay $3,200/mo, BME pays even more, AE pays $2,500/mo).\n\nThe AE faculty are stuck in the belief that a PhD is supposed to be 5 years of indentured servitude with just-above-poverty pay and absurdly challenging quals that accomplish little beyond inequitably weeding out students (I know multiple students who were told they should have failed quals but passed because their advisor is so and so). That romance for the \"good old days\" is purely exploitative and is simply not today's reality. Competition for PhD programs is so intense that most admits already have MS degrees and/or work experience. PhD students aren't vulnerable 22-26 year olds anymore, but 25-30 year olds. GT AE still thinks they can get away with paying barely anything for high research output, while virtually every other comparable university (including other departments at GT) has moved on and left GT AE behind. This also doesn't consider that GT's student fees (which also apply to grad students, no matter their coursework status) are among the highest among comparable universities. Around 10% of your salary goes to having the opportunity to be paid minimum wage.\n\nIf you have any choice, I highly recommend choosing another program. I know GT is your dream school, but please, please take this advice seriously. The GT brand is not worth what AE has done to take advantage of its PhD students, and from the recent conversations between AE's GSA and the faculty, has full intention to continue doing.",

However, understand that much of the challenge comes from within, from traits that are inherent in you and the reason you were accepted in the first place. Because you have what it takes to make it!\n\nWhat does this mean? If you choose to attend; it will be incredibly stressful. You will feel the imposter syndrome. You will strongly consider quitting, and your reasons will be valid. Your grades will be lower than ever before. And very likely, you will eventually have a mental breakdown (often within the first year).  None of this is meant to imply that \"you are incapable or lesser\" in any way. But setting these expectations in advance will help you to perservere when you are at your lowest. Because if you already got admitted, you can do it!  It's up to you to not give up; that is the final test.\n\nAs for housing; i've heard that Home Park (the area on the immediate north side of campus) is well known for robberies. But it is so close, and affordable, that it is a popular place for students. If you can afford a little more, i know many people that live on the east side of campus that are much happier. Meanwhile, south and west of campus, depending on distance from school, gets pretty sketchy... i would avoid these two areas.\n\nLastly, myself and a few final grad students choose to live in the suburbs and drive to campus. This distant north gets much cheaper than downtown/midtown, and places are bigger and nicer... but you pay with your driving time. Our commute is about 20-30 minutes, and im probably the furthest at about 30 minutes away, living in Marietta. 3 or 4 live in Dunwoody.",

Whether those of us who are familiar with the program (or at least with the department, as in my case) should encourage you or discourage you from spending half a decade of your life there really depends on what your alternatives are. \n\nSSDL \u2014 which I assume is your lab given your comment about astrodynamics/GNC \u2014 is a great lab and you\u2019ll likely be a part of fantastic research, and you may or may not be actively involved in flight projects as well. \n\nAt the same time, SSDL/GTAE is neither the only place, nor the absolute best place, where you can do either or both of those things. For example, given your interests, I wouldn\u2019t tell you to pick Tech over Boulder... There is a higher concentration of true astrodynamicists there, as well as at Purdue and Austin, so if you wanted to go down that path I\u2019d probably point you in that direction. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d put GTAE in general above all other top AE schools in any other subfield other than pure systems engineering. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I can empirically confirm the other comment about Ph.D students from smaller labs having a harder time passing their quals. My former roommate was brilliant, worked his ass off, and didn\u2019t make the cut. He was in a small lab.",

There are efforts being made around campus to expand those student services (I heard something about construction of more dorms), but not fast enough to keep up with the rate at which GT is accepting new students.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s good they continue to provide access to Georgia Tech and more students without reducing their acceptance rate as aggressively, it really seems unsustainable to keep increasing the number of first-year admits accepted each year without noticeably reducing the quality of the student experience. Although I don\u2019t see this negatively affecting things like research money/prestige, academic rankings, graduation rates, etc. that are the most pressing concerns for the admin.",

Because permitting, building, approvals etc are the way they are, the latter will take a few years to realize. But the former can be realized immediately, and should be IMO. Tech can and probably should drop the instate admit rate to make the school a bit more competitive and also decrease the pressure on infrastructure. The impact of that on prestige is a separate conversation but from where I stand it isn't a bad thing.   \n\n\nPrimary, admin needs to recognize that GT cannot grow by a huge amount without growing its services. While decreasing admit rates to give infrastructure more breathing room may decrease access, it lets GT make school itself cheaper by increasing how many people can be on-campus and not pay inflated rates off campus.",

If you want Tech to admit fewer students, the number of OOS and international students would have to drop too.\u00a0\n\n60% is not an unreasonable percentage given Tech is a public university. Most of our public peers have much harsher in-state/OOS restrictions than that. UNC is required by the NC legislature to be 82% in-state. UT Austin is always over 90% in-state because of its unique admissions process. UVA is required by its state legislature to be 2/3rds in state IIRC. The State of CA recently dropped the hammer on OOS admissions in the UC System.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely not a bad thing that the State of GA wants to keep schools 60% in-state and should the opposite happen, you\u2019ll get a situation like CA where several schools are on Tech\u2019s level but the general perception (which does not match reality) is that none of them are actually accessible to students from CA.

However, I will never recommend intel unless ur genuinely passionate and interested about AI/ML or doing a master's or phd in the Intel area (AI/ML) or doing research in it.\n\nIf u dont fall into those categories, its not even worth the hassle. Most people will tell you your threads dont matter but id say they kind of do bc the selection of classes in intel is so useless if u dont fall into those categories. Ur learning introductory topics that are difficult to understand and putting urself through multiple stages of hell (getting the class bc of how little seats there are, shitty profs, bad grades) to take them just to never use them in industry bc u need higher level education and experience to land those jobs/research. even a master's in ML will probably not get u a job in ML because there aren't many entry level roles in ML. so even with a master's, ur still looking for a normal swe job.\n\nSpeaking in a career-focused perspective, most CS majors just wanna become a SWE and id say the only benefit i got out of intel is that all the higher level classes use python and it helped me switch from java to python in my leetcode. If u jus wanna be a SWE, id take like Info/sysarch or like info/devices or even like info/people for a balanced schedule. the reason i say info is because the classes teach u things u'll actually get asked about in an interview like i was asked about like databases, caching and load balancing (cs 2200 stuff), networking, TCP/IP. Actually learning C/C++/Linux/Java is better than Intel.",

I struggled a lot because I didn\u2019t have good study habits last sem and got a C in CS 1331. Now I\u2019m in 1332 and have been grinding since day one going to office hours and really doing everything I can and I got an 88 on my first exam which I was happy with if not estatic. Then my friends mentioned they both got 100s and I watched them \u201cstudy\u201d the night before and they just sped run through one practice test together and that\u2019s about it. I guess imposter syndromes really hitting me hard and was wondering if I\u2019m the only one struggling this much?? Because everyone else seems to be doing okay. And I\u2019ve been telling myself comparison is the thief of joy but my heart won\u2019t belive me. Idk I just need to let that out and was curious if anyone else is in the same boat.",

However, everyone around you at Tech is just like you in terms of the level of success they had in high school. A new bell curve is made out of brilliant students from all over the world when you start out at a school like this - which means that being an \u201caverage\u201d student isn\u2019t a bad thing at all. \n\nMy advice would be to do your best to remove your grades from being a part of your self-worth at all. It is important to realize that you are much more than whatever grade you got on your last test. Tech is a grueling experience for most every student, and heaping more stress and pressure on yourself isn\u2019t going to do any good. \n\nThere will be highs and lows, but I promise it will all even out in the end. I can tell you from my own experience that my very worst grade at Tech (a D) was in a class regarding a very specialized field. I ended up getting a job in that very same field, and have been very successful in my career so far relative to my peers. It goes to show that a grade isn\u2019t even necessarily an indicator of future proficiency in that subject, so why go as far to let it determine the way you view yourself as a person? \n\nJust do your best, join some clubs, get involved with some cool projects and enjoy the ride! It will be over before you know it, and you\u2019ll be looking back on your time at Tech with fond memories.",

Instead, compare yourself 'today' to how you were yesterday. Everyday, learn a tiny bit. It will be imperceptible, and sometimes feel like backtracking due to the Red Queen effect. But after even 2 years of this 'feeling of backtracking', you will notice how much further ahead you became compared to the rest of the world outside of Tech.\n\nYour experiences are normal and expected.

Most likely, there is nobody in your 1332 class would be able to implement a neural network, explain ed25519 elliptic curve cryptography, or describe SSL certificate chaining; these are all things *you* have the potential to learn at GT.\n\nAlso, an 88 is not a bad grade for a 1332 test.

And that a C is supposed to be the average, and he wasn't going to curve the exam.\n\nThat was definitely a reality check. I applied myself better, and remembered that lesson, and ended up getting an A in the class, a 4.0 for my freshman year, and graduated with a 3.89 GPA.\n\nYes, it will be ok.

I transferred in from way south ga in Spring 2008 and almost flunked out within 6 weeks. Ultimately, I changed majors, cut back my hours at work, and really spent time figuring myself out and spent time asking myself what I really wanted. I got in as a nuclear major, but changed to electrical and it was the best decision I ever made. I then reached out during my second semester in the fall to the email lists for the entire DSP class asking if anyone wanted to study - and a few people responded that I still consider great friends today. I got out in May 2011 and wouldn't change a thing - especially the difficult soul searching.\n\nI think alot of the pressure and self doubt for me came from constantly being told I was smart or clever by friends and family and being a relatively big fish in a backwater small pond. The best advice for that is find what makes you happy, latch onto it, and see where it leads. I still remember there was one particular day that the sun came out and I sat outside in the garden across from the library with some good music playing and then I remember just riding the bus a couple laps around campus aimlessly. Something about it just felt good.\n\nHang in there and if you need any support, I and many others are here for you. It takes hard work and dedication to get what you want, but sometimes you might realize that you gotta shake things up a bit or find your stride.",

GT has always been my dream school and I thought this would be the place I\u2019d finally settle down, but since coming here, it\u2019s been really hard to find my place. I met a few people in my FASET group, but we\u2019re all different majors and some of them commute so we\u2019re not super close. I tried informal rush but got dropped by every sorority. However, I\u2019m mostly concerned about the competitive culture. I knew it would difficult, but I\u2019d heard my classes would be more collaborative than I\u2019ve experienced them to be. I\u2019ve found it very hard to do group work or ask for help in my classes. I\u2019ll reach out to my group with questions about lecture or hw and they will either not respond or say they didn\u2019t see my message until after the hw/exam passes. I\u2019m fine with going to OH, but I feel some questions don\u2019t need to be directly answered by the professor when a simple text can suffice. At my old school my friends and I would study together and help each other as much as possible. I just thought that was the norm. I get the vibe that students here think helping others is in some way disadvantaging them. So I ask\u2026does it get better? Is this just typical of intro courses and people will warm up over time? I\u2019m seriously contemplating switching schools again. I\u2019m tired and just want to be settled in somewhere. App deadlines are coming up and I need to figure out what to do. What are y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",

All the other students had already found their groups and it has been a challenge to make friends with them (partly also because I'm an introvert). They all study together, while I do my homework alone. I've also haven't been able to establish a bond with my roommates either. It's tough sometimes, but GaTech was also one of my dream schools. I'm grateful to my PI who took me in his lab, and I love the work I get to do here. I think it's a slow process, especially if you transfer over. It's not all that bad though. My labmates have been very nice, and they've kept me going so far. I also managed to talk regularly to a few folks in my classes.Try joining a club, or sign up for activities! I think it will take time, and will be slow as hell, but I guess you gotta push through if everything else is to your liking.",

These are students/peers that are likely struggling to balance their own studies and lives, just like you.  They aren\u2019t tutors or TAs, or even people that have signed up to be in a peer study group.  They certainly have no obligation to teach class material via text message.  What might feel like quick questions to ask likely would take a meaningful amount of thought and time to put a response together for you.\n\nExpecting other students to give their time to help you out in your classes is a not a normal expectation to have.  If you find a friends group that makes time to study together, that\u2019s awesome and those things exist. But that\u2019s not what the group in a group project is meant for. If you need help learning the material so that you can contribute to the group assignments, that\u2019s really on you to find mechanisms meant to help people study/learn.  Office hours like you mentioned, study groups, tutors, etc.\n\nGood luck!",

I'm at a small liberal arts school now (saving money and time) and am graduating next year with a pure science major. I've made a couple friends and also just everyday mundane things seem nicer at my new school (pretty campus, friendlier students/profs, less people in classes, etc.) I'm not going to lie, I was a little worried about how transferring so many times might look to future applications but I was just accepted into an internship at an ivy with that on my record so idk how much it matters. I just knew tech wasn't right for me and I honored that (with family support which I think helped a lot)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: also side note- I did like my first school too, I just wanted to try out engineering so I had already built up some good connection with profs/friends by the time I was at tech",

New paint is on the deck as well as the lines for Tennis and Basketball. New additions to the courts are Pickleball and a Roller Derby practice track.\n\nSome photos can be found here: https://imgur.com/a/nVMqXYb\n\nIf you wish to reserve Peter's Parking Deck, reach out to us via email, and we'll work to get your event in place.\n\nThanks, all, for your patience!",

Seems like pretty bad advice, but let me explain:\n\nAt least from what I've seen, most people that go to clubs are there for an hour and just leave and return the next week. I pulled the same thing my first two semesters at Tech and I felt the same way. Honestly, that is expected. I think many people forget that a club isn't just a 1 hour a week thing, but something you actively engage in. You get what you put in. If you go for an hour and don't stick around after meeting chatting with people, you find yourself in that position where you go home and think \"Time to wait another week to go back to club to talk to no one\". For a ton of the people I see attend aniclub (the club Im most active in), they never really stick around to hang out after we are finished watching shows and I never get the opportunity to meet them because of that. I can say the same for myself when I stayed in my dorm 90% of the day and didn't try to go to unofficial club events. No one ever got the opportunity to talk to me because I never gave myself the chance to put myself out there and try to start conversation after/during meeting times.\n\nThat is where I think clubs like D&amp;D and Anime Club shine. D&amp;D I think is the more obvious example of this. You aren't actively playing D&amp;D (p2e on top btw) during club. Instead, you find a game and play it outside of club time. Before you know it, you are actively hanging out with the people you play with on the weekends outside of session because you put yourself in that situation where you form bonds. For anime club, we have a channel called #culc-cult in the discord where most people will ping if we are all hanging out in Crosland or we will post when we all go out to dinner after meetings, or even board game night. If you look hard enough, every club has something like this.\n\nAnyways I'm writing all of this to say to not let that twice a month meeting time limit you. Maybe message the main slack or discord channel and see if anyone wants to make plans, or if that is too much, try taking small steps and meeting a couple people that regularly attend and hang out with them",

My student org was having a meeting while the PA system was blasting just constant curse words. That stuff doesn't normally bother me, it was going on last semester but this semester it just got way way worse. With this music playing all the way across the student center and having heard songs graphically describing fingerbanging and violence against women, it's really a problem. Even more so because this was during the swim meet yesterday where hundreds of children are getting lunch at chick-fil-a, and kids are touring the school, its a really bad look for us.\n\nI'd honestly like it if they just turned the music off entirely, because it's hard to study with that going on constantly, but please at least stop playing constant explicit music.",

Not to mention, it's a public building, so there are always going to be rational limits on what can be played there. If you still want to listen to such music, that's what earbuds are for. Ofc, I don't know what songs they're referring to and if they're overreacting, but if they aren't then this seems like a valid conplaint.",

The same people whose dopamine receptors are fried from scrolling tiktok and IG reels at the same time. When someone defends the Stucen music that not only plays inside but through the outside speakers, blasting across tech green all I hear is \u201cI can\u2019t enjoy this public space without some kind of distraction from my own thoughts!\u201d Alright bro we get it. You enjoy being blasted with royalty free music like you have some kind of anti homeless architecture fetish.\n\n\nLike bro, if you want music so bad feel free to wear headphones- they have the added benefit of playing whatever you want! If you legitimately enjoy listening to the same top fifty pop songs someone chose for you idk what to tell you man, you\u2019re cooked. You probably have subway surfers gameplay going while you\u2019re in lecture.\n\n\nIt just really takes away from the versatility of the Stucen. Strangely enough, if you go to the Stucen after dark when all the food places are closed, you\u2019ll be strangely hard pressed to find any of these so-called Stucen enjoyers \ud83e\udd14 funnily enough, everyone who\u2019s there is on their laptop studying or doing homework. So we can really just dismiss this whole \u201crecreational aspect\u201d of it- after dark anyways.

The student center literally wasn't designed to be a study space, it was made for students to hang out, socialize, eat, and be entertained. Of course there will be music. If OP thinks the music is too explicit, that's a valid complaint. However, complaining that you can't study in the student center really isn't.

It's a much better idea to have each bin type in the same location. Going to a further bin the app suggested is even more friction.\n\nI could see using something like wave an item over an edge device right above the trash bins that identified the item.",

I will definitely mention this issue with the GT recycling coordinator Malte Weiland and see if we can get some improved signage on those bins this semester.\n\nContamination is definitely one of the primary issues we are trying to address by giving accurate rules through the ECGO app, but you are right, signage is immediately accessible and we have heard anecdotes from some recycling coordinators that great signage can lead to both lower contamination and higher engagement.\n\nIn regards to your idea about edge devices, both Scrapp and Oscar Sort are trying out these approaches with mixed success. The unfortunate aspect of edge devices is their upfront cost, continued maintenance, and propensity to be stolen. Furthermore, we believe that although there are improvements to be made at the bin, the biggest oversight in recycling in the US is the lack of community/culture and direct incentives. We believe these are best delivered and scaled through an in-app experience and we have big plans to substantially improve both for the Fall semester.",

By comparing the clusters by the number of bins within and the number of images taken, we get a basic view into how well supported an area's waste stream is.

The enclosure must be equipped with advanced security measures to prevent SCP-GT from breaching containment, including electromagnetic barriers, motion sensors, and a 24/7 surveillance system. Interaction with SCP-GT is to be limited to personnel with Level 3 clearance and above, and any maintenance or research within the enclosure must be conducted under strict supervision. Personnel engaging with SCP-GT must wear standard issue protective gear to prevent potential harm caused by SCP-GT's unpredictable behavior. In case of a containment breach, Protocol GT-Alpha is to be initiated, involving the use of specialized acoustic devices designed to pacify SCP-GT and guide it back to its enclosure. Description: SCP-GT appears as a large, metallic creature resembling a yellow jacket wasp, an entity closely associated with the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). Despite its metallic structure, SCP-GT exhibits organic behaviors such as territorial displays, vocalizations reminiscent of traditional college chants, and high levels of agility and strength. SCP-GT possesses the ability to inspire and invigorate individuals around it, particularly those affiliated with or supportive of Georgia Tech. SCP-GT's origin remains unknown, but it was first contained following a series of events at Georgia Tech where it was observed leading rallies and participating in sports events, causing significant disturbances due to its anomalous abilities and the fervor it incited in the populace. Addendum GT-1: SCP-GT has demonstrated a unique ability to affect technological devices within its vicinity, often causing them to operate at significantly enhanced efficiency levels. This effect seems to be beneficial, although the potential for SCP-GT to inadvertently compromise electronic security measures necessitates further study. Addendum GT-2: Incident GT-5 occurred on \\[REDACTED\\], when SCP-GT breached containment during the annual \"Homecoming\" event at Georgia Tech. SCP-GT was observed leading a parade, with numerous individuals, both students, and faculty, following it in a state of heightened excitement. The event resulted in minor property damage but no casualties. SCP-GT returned to its containment voluntarily after approximately 2 hours. The incident has led to a revision of containment protocols to include countermeasures for specific Georgia Tech events.~~\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Following the \"Incident of 17\", SCP-GT's containment protocols have been significantly revised. SCP-GT is now housed in a high-security Keter-class containment facility at Site-\u2588\u2588, specifically designed to mitigate its enhanced capabilities and prevent any form of external influence or escape. The containment facility is equipped with multiple redundant security layers, including electromagnetic barriers capable of nullifying SCP-GT's anomalous effects, vibration-dampening walls to counteract its acoustic influence, and a Faraday cage to prevent its interaction with electronic devices. All personnel interactions with SCP-GT, including maintenance, research, and security operations, are to be conducted remotely or via autonomous drones. Direct human contact is strictly forbidden without approval from the O5 Council, given SCP-GT's demonstrated ability to manipulate human emotions and technology. In the event of a containment breach, Protocol GT-Kappa is to be immediately enacted, involving site-wide lockdown, deployment of Mobile Task Forces equipped with specialized anomalous countermeasures, and activation of the site's Scranton Reality Anchors to negate SCP-GT's abilities.\n\n**Description:** SCP-GT is a highly advanced, anomalous entity with the appearance of a metallic yellow jacket wasp, emblematic of the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). SCP-GT exhibits both organic and mechanical characteristics, with the ability to exert control over technology and influence human emotions, particularly those related to competitiveness and loyalty to Georgia Tech. SCP-GT's reclassification to Keter was necessitated by the Incident of 17, where it demonstrated previously unseen capabilities, including mass emotional manipulation, spontaneous generation of technological constructs, and a significant resistance to previously effective containment measures.\n\n**Addendum GT-1:** The Incident of 17 occurred during an unauthorized testing phase, where SCP-GT managed to override its containment field, resulting in a campus-wide blackout and the temporary loss of control over several Foundation assets. SCP-GT mobilized a large group of civilians and personnel, instigating a large-scale event that mimicked a campus riot. The incident resulted in multiple casualties and significant damage to Foundation property.\n\n**Addendum GT-2:** SCP-GT's influence over technology and human behavior is more profound than initially assessed. It can induce a highly competitive and aggressive state in individuals, significantly enhancing their physical capabilities and technological understanding, albeit at the cost of their rationality and awareness of their surroundings.\n\n**Note:** SCP-GT has become a subject of interest within the Foundation not only for its unique characteristics but also for the potential application of its technology-enhancing abilities. Research proposals aimed at understanding and possibly harnessing this aspect of SCP-GT are currently under review. However, SCP-GT's ability to inspire extreme loyalty and its control over technology pose a significant threat not only to the structural integrity of the Foundation but also to the global balance of power should its influence extend beyond containment. Ongoing research focuses on understanding the full extent of SCP-GT's capabilities and developing more effective containment and countermeasures.",

Since you did your undergrad at GT, you should know some professors that you have a good rapport with. If you\u2019re going to work with any of them, mail them ahead of time and talk about your interest and that you\u2019re going to be coming back to school. That would help you get in for sure.",

Like when having the thought \"ugh I know I have to still do this shit\" hanging over my head, and then simultaneously being frustrated that I still couldn't bring myself to start, I learned to shift my focus to doing something easy to do that didn't feel like work, even if it seemed like an extremely small baby step.\n\nFor example: If I have this whole problem set to do and I haven't even started it yet and I realize (as you have) that the anxiety alone is not helping (maybe making things worse). In this case I would instead shift to thinking of how I can make it easier for my future self to do the work. I can pull out my laptop and open up the problem set from canvas. That's easy. I'll work on it later but I've done that step. I can take out my notes from the past week so they're ready for me to look through them. Not stressful. Well, now that I have it open, I but I can at least read through the problems, even if I need to study later to fully understand them. If some feel easy to knock out, maybe I'll start them now, maybe later. Right now it's late, if I think  I'm not going to be productive tonight anyway, I can force myself to sleep (or just rest in bed without devices) make sure I waking up earlier and I'll have everything ready for me to start\n\nThis method isn't a panacea, but it is something that cumulatively made a big difference over my years at Tech. And if this isn't the right method for you, I'm sure you will find your own way to make your intelligence work best for you. Best of luck!",

Its a paradigm change. Its a different perspective for living life. The problem is not you cannot find you motivation externally in the world, I believe it is that you do not have motivation existing in your heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet the world go for a few. Take some time. Go to a mountain top or something. Write in a journal. Find what you want to work towards, a dream, a goal, and let your passion for the future or your hate for the present spurn your will for change. *This*, in the long run, will give you motivation that burns for much longer than 11:55 pm energy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, just for clarification, this is my own way of seeing things, and I know I said a lot, probably an unexpected response. I dont mean to convince you or \"convert\" you or anything like that. Just sharing some of my thoughts that I think could help you.",

My groupmate emailed them (on a Friday) for the first big assignment (due on a Monday) because there was no rubric or real guidelines posted for it. No response, and we all got docked off 10%+ for not including items that were never specified to us. Only feedback was to \"answer more specifically\". \n\nThis week, we have a pretty critical discrepancy in our results ie it makes no physical sense. We group emailed the TA and prof on Wednesday, only got a response from the TA saying they were unsure and asking the prof if they have any ideas. We emailed back to the group email both yesterday and today, still no response from prof. This assignment is also due Monday before class, which is the only time we see the prof in person. I wish I had the foresight to identify future obstacles (on Monday, when we see them in class) we may run into for an assignment assigned Wed and due Mon, but alas. Any outside of class communication feels impossible. \n\nOffice hours are by appointment only, which is kind of difficult to schedule if we just get ghosted by email. I pulled up to their office a couple times and they were not there. We're just gonna have to BS this assignment and chalk it up to human errors probably, even though I'm 99% sure there's more to it than that. But in the future, how do we deal with an unresponsive prof if the TA is unable to help? Just deal and survive the semester? Anyone else we can go to outside of the instructional team? I'm almost out of here, this just sucks. Thanks friends \ud83e\udee1",

It's *very* difficult to find a complete meal for under $10 these days outside of the cheapest fast-food places.",

There's a reason the McAlisters on Northside doesn't do a ton of business with Tech students. I was thinking it would be a Panera (to replace the one in Willage) or even a step down from that.",

I just don't think it's feasible to open a proper restaurant because to have any type of 'authentic' feel, you need a lot of spices and condiments that require (in the US) non-native ingredients meaning that if you want authentic food, it's $30 or more if you want it to be a full meal but those types of restaurants don't really suit the lifestyle of a college student. So I think it's not really feasible, on the other hand, I'm really surprised there isn't a food truck of pani-puri/dosas and indian snack food, I think that's pretty doable",

I actually found I don't even look back at my notes often when I do the HWs and end up sourcing help from the internet anyway. Instead of multitasking on notes, try to just focus on the online lecture and remember as much as you can and then go straight to the HW ASAP to solidify or confirm your understanding. CS 1331 is a course that's half on what you remember the semantic basics of and what you can code to make sure you understand how those basics actually work. At least when I took the course that's how my tests were structured.",

My PI; however, did not tell me that I would need to be using the web-clock on OneUSG to log my hours. This was a miscommunication on their part as they likely assumed I was already using it for my other position, which I am not because my supervisor puts in our time manually. \n\nSo, I worked 9 hours during the first 2 weeks of school and did not log them, which means I was not compensated. I immediately emailed them when I figured that out and their attitude was very much \u201cyou should\u2019ve logged them\u201d and they essentially ignored any email I sent requesting and update on whether or not they were able to get in contact with payroll and fix it.\n\nThese past 2 weeks, I made sure to log my time. There were some mistakes on my timesheet because the website is super glitchy so it logged my in time on one position and despite me setting the page to be on that position, switched to my other position when I punched out so that had to be corrected. I worked over 11 hours over the past 2 weeks and this morning I noticed that my time had been changed to 5.2 hours, which means I am now missing 15 hours worth of compensation. \n\nI also put in an inquiry with OneUSG and apparently my PI is the only one who can fix it \ud83d\ude42\n\nI emailed my PI about this again and included the live document my team has been using to log our hours week to week, but I\u2019m almost positive they\u2019re going to ignore it and at this point I\u2019m considering not working at all until I am fairly compensated. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s illegal for people to deliberately refuse to compensate you, but is this a bad idea?",

If that doesn\u2019t work then you probably need to ask your PI if you all can set up a meeting with whoever in your department works with grants to see the most appropriate solution to getting the back pay fixed. If the PI stonewalls you at that point your options are (1) ombud (2) Dean of students (3) department chair. Not in that order specifically. \n\nUsually the best course of action is to find a way to resolve the issue without requiring additional paperwork. You may have slightly higher taxes inputting in more hours but at the number of hours you are putting in it would be negligible and wouldn\u2019t affect your overall end of year tax burden. \n\nUnfortunately these issues are not gatech or even higher education specific, though you see them happen at research universities when faculty who are trained in X field are tasked with work beyond their training (finance, administration, etc.) bc we in academia somehow think a PHD and a faculty job grant us magical powers. \n\nHope this helps.\n\nOne last note: a good phrase to have in your arsenal now and forever is \u201cI can\u2019t continue to work without appropriate compensation, what can we do to resolve this issue? Who can we talk to to get this resolved?\u201d Approach it as a problem to solve together not as an adversarial situation, and it can help. But stand your ground on getting a timely resolution.",

It was likely done by another admin who is ensuring compliance with your worked hours vs max hours according to your percentage employment. How many hours had you put in for your other job?\n\nTo be clear, the amount of money you receive from your PI is vanishingly small compared to the amount they have to pay for a graduate student, which includes paying tuition. To be honest, your relationship with your PI is more valuable in the long term if you have any designs for graduate school, so keep that in mind before you might cause a schism. To resolve the hours issue, go talk to the department office your PI is in to talk to the finance person. They have ultimate authority over this, not your PI.",

I'm a student at GaTech, and I borrowed a Microsoft Surface laptop from the college for coursework. Unfortunately, I entrusted my laptop to a friend to submit in the library, but he mistakenly handed it over to the IT department instead.\n\nNow, the library is insisting that they never received the laptop, and they're asking me to pay a hefty $1500 fee. When I approached the IT department, they claimed they don't have the laptop either. I'm at a loss for what to do next.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation before? Are there any steps I can take to track down my laptop or resolve this issue with the library and IT department? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!",

Make sure that you mention that you've been experiencing both things.\n\nYou don't want to mess around and delay too much when one of your symptoms is numbness, because that points to your nerves possibly being involved. Nerves don't heal very well if they've been damaged, so if something might be hurting them it helps a lot to find it and address it quickly.",

Check the syllabus beforehand so you can be well-informed of their policies, but still ask even if the syllabus mentions the official channels. Depending on if you plan to pursue option 3, be frank but professional. Technically they're supposed to ask you to keep details confidential, but a little honesty can go a long ways. Above all, COVID has encouraged them to insist that you not come when truly sick. Do with that info what you will, considering periods aren't contagious XD\n\nIf the prof requests proof or you suspect will be difficult: \n\nOption 2: STAMPS\n(The one time I managed to get an appt they were closed when I got there. No particular advice. I have heard that the women's health department is pretty good from a decent amount of ppl, but overall the place has a rather mixed bag of feedback.)\n\n\nOption 3 (particularly if stamps has no appts, if you are in too much pain to want to leave, and/or have insurance that covers it nicely) teledoc or other virtual appt. Your goal is a doctor's note, that goes to the office of the dean. They send you an official letter back to forward to the prof, but bewarned, how exactly any makeup is handled still depends on the prof. I recommend checking their syllabus still. Obviously what the doc writes on the note depends on the person, and on what you say or ask (including Rx)\n\n\nAs a fellow woman, I agree with these other commentors that you should seek medical advice if you can!",

The campus integration isn\u2019t bad either, as it allows students to directly search to see if there\u2019s a club they are interested in, but as for finding small interest groups, it\u2019s a bit harder in that regard since the servers are sorted by member count.",

For the project we're also interested in how to get people to meet up in-person on campus. In the old photography club we did I think bi-weekly meetings with photo &amp; editing critiques and competitions on the overhead projectors; workshops on different techniques and technical aspects of photography. Also club trips to places like the Atlanta Zoo and Botanical Gardens, I think some areas of the Greenway etc. Thanks for creating the Discord though, I think that there definitely should be a photography group on campus as a club or otherwise.",

I woke up and couldn\u2019t feel my right arm, then when I stood, again, my knees gave up on me. Now it hurts to walk.

However, blood tests and other types of exams can be expensive (but still cheaper! than in many non-campus clinics) depending on what your symptoms are. I had some gallbladder-liver issues last semester and paid about $500 in blood tests (but it was a LOT of blood tests), which I now have a claim with my outside insurance for, trying to get it back.\n\nSchool insurance is really unnecessary because it's way more expensive per semester than any out-of-pocket you would possibly pay. Also, if you are lucky to have outside insurance, you can always either file a claim, or the doctor will send you to outside institutions for any CT/MRI/other medical tests that require a referral. And with outside insurance, these tests go down in price from thousands of dollars to literally 40 bucks. Even blood tests tbh, but I didn't realize this early enough.\n\nIf you don't have even outside insurance, then you are more unlucky, but at the very least you should go to a doctor's visit because they are free. And even though you'll pay out-of-pocket for the blood tests, you should still take them if your doctor wants you to, because blood tests have valuable information that could narrow down your diagnosis. Then at least you'll know how serious your condition is, and you could start talking about options. One thing to remember is that stress alone can cause so many weird conditions, that if you are constantly in stress, it's worth considering ways to destress, or minimizing stressors because they can seriously detrimental to your health. And you'll know if your stress levels are through the roof enough for this to be a possible cause.",

Nelson and Shell, this semester alone, has had the water cut off completely atleast 5 times now, each times lasting many hours past their emailed time expectations. \n\nNot only this, but on unrelated occasions the hot water is turned off with no prior warning. Today the hot water has been turned off again, and there was literally no email sent. I had to call the office and be told that the hot water was turned off. \u201cIt should have been emailed.\u201d The \u201cit should\u201d seems to be their go to at this point. It should but it never actually is. \n\nNot to mention the fact that The director for Nelson Shell, literally ignored my emails twice. Each time for separate issues. She\u2019ll respond to the first one asking for more information, and then never actually acts or even has the common decency to reply to my email with additional information. What\u2019s ironic is that the first email has plenty of information to begin with\u2026. \n\nI could write a 3 page paper about all of the issues of the dorm, but it\u2019s pointless because housing could literally care less.",

They got the flooding under wraps in okay time (like, just one full day) but would not help dry out his flooded room. Say Friday it leaked, Sunday they put those floppy gray pads in his room and the living room. Monday they came and removed the pads and fucked off. Tuesday they came and then talked to one of the roommates and left. Finally by Wednesday they put some damn fans in his room. Meanwhile he couldnt sleep in that undoubtedly biohazard room and it smelled like ass, so he slept on the couch in the still moist living room. \n\nEvery day he called either emergency maintenance or RA on duty and just got told it wasn't an emergency. Kind of is urgent if you have active mold growing and the things in his room are on a time limit before they get permanently damaged. If they just did their job the first day they came to dry shit out it wouldve been easier for everyone my brother in Christ. Nelson Shell as well btw",

Unfortunately this caused flooding and now they have to do repairs. However, not only were we not informed that these repairs were going underway, we were also not told that they would be going into our apartments without prior warning.\n\nI was taking a test for a class on honorlock when suddenly someone started hammering the wall next to mine. There was also sawing and drilling, just all kinds of noises and there were no emails or no postings about the fact that this would be in my kitchen and living room.\n\nThey also ripped the floor out in the kitchen. My living room is not accessible, it has a giant tarp covering it. The entire space smells like toxic fumes and I wear a mask when I am out of my room.\n\n[They took out the floor of my kitchen without telling me. Now the floor is sticky and it all smells like toxic fumes.](https://preview.redd.it/3pr6c3fno3gc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3542c23c39d3e3cc22c6b24b6fc069860d50da59)\n\n[They took out kitchen cabinets and the wall.](https://preview.redd.it/njzpw89zp3gc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb65a3aef6e80f9941d464554ea16b7ba3e24ad0)\n\n[My living room. They took everything from our cabinets and put it on the floor in the living room. It is unusable.](https://preview.redd.it/npjw7nf1q3gc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6c106497e10abc3b08d240e99f666a873e612a2)\n\nAfter they've been working on my floor for the past 2 weeks (they've been IN my apartment for 3 of those days), we all got the following email. It says we will receive an individual notice if they will do something with our apartment, but I still have not gotten said email...\n\n[Look at this shit](https://preview.redd.it/hlobw6hvn3gc1.png?width=539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b73d036abfb82a9611e535d5590c87f9f6a05e6)\n\nThe cherry on top of this disaster: my ethernet was out for two straight weekends and my roommate lost power to all outlets in his room.\n\nI am extremely upset and disappointed in the way GT is handling this. Anyone else in the same boat?\n\nEdit: I am currently trapped in my room. I woke up and the kitchen floor and bathroom floor were torn out and have this glue on them. A contractor was there and he told me that I can't walk on it. Updating because people dismissed the problem since we were given an email and got 'compensation' (I got $200 dining dollars) for this. Currently requesting to move to another location during repairs. I got an email about my room needing rennovation and to pack up my stuff, nothing can be on the floors or on any desks. I called the housing office today to find out more about the repairs they would be doing and, moving up the chain of command, I am waiting to hear back. I really have to go to the bathroom, so hoping to be able to use it soon (cannot leave room or use bathroom because kitchen floor has paste on it that I was told not to walk on).",

        "selftext": "As a student body, we are very upset with the administration for moving spring graduation from Bobby Dodd, where it has been held the last few years, to McCamish Pavilion. This historic venue has been a goal for many students to walk across the stage and complete their prestigious degree. \nMost of the undergraduates attending this ceremony will be those who did not receive a normal high school graduation ceremony because they are 2020 grads, so this could be the first and only time they and their families would have the chance to see them walk across the stage.\nThe benefit of Bobby Dodd that is also being overlooked is the ability for as many friends and family members to attend graduation. Many students' families have made travel plans around the graduation schedule that has been around for years. Now, these family members may not be able to attend a once-in-a-lifetime ceremony for many because of the ticket limits. We also will not be able to have other friends who have not yet graduated or are in other ceremonies attend the graduation, which has long been a benefit of unlimited seating in Bobby Dodd. \nWe request the Georgia Tech administration and President Cabrera to move the Spring 2024 graduation back to Bobby Dodd. If the weather is inclement, McCamish as an emergency plan is understandable, but it is not understandable why we have this long tradition of walking across Grant Field taken from thousands of Georgia Tech students.",

The pictures were essentially worthless. and the stadium is so big for the number of people and students it felt kinda empty. Yea the ticket number limit is better but I\u2019ve never known anyone with an issue getting tickets. There\u2019s plenty of opportunities after the initial ticket allotment to get extras. A lot of people don\u2019t even go to graduation and just give them away. Other aholes sell them. And I think the school also gives away any extras in a lottery type system. I graduated in mccamish twice. And my sister I Bobby Dodd once and we all agreed mccamish was way better",

I imagine it would be the same for others, especially those in ROTC or other related programs. Your petition is a spit in the face of people with family that have conditions where they can\u2019t sit in the shiny bright Bobby Dodd bleachers in the May heat for 2 hours. Just because you and your immediate contacts want something, does not mean that everyone wants it. You\u2019d think as someone graduating from Georgia Tech you\u2019d have the maturity and sense to realize every system has trade offs and opportunity cost. The cost of this system is 4 tickets, but it\u2019s a good solution that the admin has made the decision for. If you can\u2019t narrow down your family to four people and the rest watch virtually and congratulate after, just don\u2019t take any of them and then they\u2019ll all be equal and you\u2019ll be $1000 richer from selling your tickets",

Especially when a graduation a couple of years ago ended abruptly in the middle of a storm.  And you don't have to deal with May heat or the chilly December wind. I graduated from undergrad last May and was apparently the last group to be able to do that and I personally loved it. Sure the heat sucked, but I enjoyed it getting to buzz around the stadium field while hanging out with my friends who are all graduating and take visit where my friends and family were sitting during graduation was super fun. I also loved getting to easily sit through my other friends' graduation with a large group of my friends. I went to the Spring 2022 and Fall 2022 graduations as well and didn't mind anything and liked it. \n\nIn my personal opinion, I think if all the conditions are right then Bobby Dodd is better, but McCamish has way more advantages from a planning perspective and is a safer option for the admin to plan with. There are less issues to worry about and it is the comfortable option. The main issue is the ticketing limits. This past Fall's graduation was in McCamish and it was annoying that I wasn't able to some of my friend's graduations. I got lucky and one guy had an extra ticket for me but other than that, it can be pretty hard. It requires you to know a lot of graduates who might have an extra ticket or be willing to pay someone for a ticket. As far as I know, besides the roll call which is luck-based and you have to go pretty early to get it, some people who really want to go just won't be able to go. I am graduating with my Master's this spring and I don't even have enough for my whole family, and I'm one of the few left who's graduating so a bunch of my friends won't be able to make it in for the ceremony. McCamish is great that it is indoors but it's size really makes it annoying. I personally am hoping for Bobby Dodd but understand why they're doing it in McCamish.",

You still get to shake Cabrera\u2019s hand and receive a rolled up welcome letter from the alumni association. There\u2019s also a benefit that with smaller ceremonies, you spend less time just sitting there listening to names of people you don\u2019t know until you perk up for the ones you do know.\n\nThere is the caveat of the ticket limit, which I do agree is a fair complaint. But it\u2019s not like that completely ruins the ceremony experience for those that can be there. As a 2020 high school grad, my HS ceremony was a bit scuffed, but thankfully *both* ceremonies here have been a step up. Maybe Bobby Dodd feels more \u201ctraditional\u201d with how football has shaped the culture here, but as others have said, McCamish was the actual traditional venue.",

However, it looks like I'll be completing my degree requirements only by summer. I've already filled out the OAG because I still want to participate in the May commencement ceremony, but I'll have to reach out to OIE a week or two before May, to withdraw my application (quite a hassle).\n\nShould I apply for an early walk instead? What are the odds of approval for an early walk, and would that be a better option for me?",

Given that it was a winter graduation, there were of course less graduates. They held engineering, college of sciences, and masters all in the same ceremony. Due to this, they made the college engineering sit IN THE STANDS INSTEAD OF THE FLOOR. I was a spectator at my own graduation and I was quite unhappy about it. I would assume the same or worse with the larger May graduations if they were to be held inside. Weather is always a factor, but I would rather sit on the field and have my entire family be able to see me walk at graduation after 4-5 years of hard work. Move it back outside.",

The degree is currently in three languages (French, Spanish, German). Students can take it full-time or part-time. Most students complete it in one year (fall, spring, summer), though some students also take the degree part-time (usually completing it over two years). Undergrad BS ALIS majors can also apply to the BS/MS ALIS, a special program that allows students to count some of their BS ALIS credits towards the MS degree and thus expedite completion of the degree. No GRE is required for the application process. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions! I can also connect you to current or past students if you\u2019d like to chat with them about their experiences.",

I will also say that when I was in the program the funding was pretty good. A good bit of my cohort had some sort of GRA that helped with tuition costs. Funding isn\u2019t guaranteed (!!) but that\u2019s a possibility. \n\nThe application requirements were pretty standard:\n\n- Official Transcripts (w/ min. 3.0 GPA), \n- Two letters of recommendation (contact info), \n- Government issued ID, Statement of Purpose(4000 characters), \n- Language Proficiency Assessment Interview (essentially a series of questions that you upload your video recorded answers to in the target language)\n\nThe program course offerings might look a little different depending on your target language, but, from what I know, everyone was generally satisfied with the options! The courses spanned across digital media &amp; culture, topics on sustainability, internships, sociolinguistics, feminism, film, etc. You even get some flexibility to choose outside of the standard list as well. \n\nOne tip I would give is to try and pick your advisor (and meet with them to solidify it) waaaaay ahead of time\u2026 like 1st month of the program ahead of time if you can. That way you can start preparing for your final project/thesis during the entire program. \n\nPM me if you want more from the student perspective! I\u2019d love to chat.",

There are a lot of software focused thread combos that you can take in CompE, but in general, you wanna make sure that you have the core concepts of 2020 down for the rest of the CompE common classes(especially 2031 and 3058). I would recommend taking advantage of all of your resources to do well in 2020, and see if you feel the same at the end of the semester.",

Furthermore, you have people who work on say, packaging or pcbs, and this requires a completely different set of skills from those two(mostly circuit analysis + emag).",

You should know 2020 pretty well for 2031(Digital Circuit Design Lab) and 3058(Computer Architecture) as follow-ups.  Regardless, you should pick your major based on your goals, and it seems like you have an interest in building things.  Regardless, I'm not sure if the robotics thread would be for you since it focuses on heavily on math, although I could be wrong about you since you're considering IE.  (Fun fact, the way it turns out a lot of IE majors have to take ECE 2020, and they even have their own sections).\n\nIf you still want to build things, I would recommend looking into doing embedded systems, which something like DSSD + Devices(in CmpE) could help you achieve.  I don't think most people actually want to do \"robotics\" which truly involves hard math, but hey, that might be you.\n\nRegardless, you should try to pick a major and concentrations that align with your specific goals.  The variety of career directions between majors, within a major, or even within a given concentration or class can vary greatly.",

You will struggle no matter what major you choose. GT has classes that will challenge you. These sometimes really stink but this rigor is what turns you into a helluva engineer. Do not switch majors because it is difficult. If you want to switch because you are more interested in a different topic, that is fine. But go to office hours, get knack tutoring, ask the TAs for help and DONT SWITCH MAJORS. Even if your GPA takes a hit, you can still find great jobs and it is always always better to do so in a field you are interested in.",

                "body": "Don\u2019t be shy to escalate issues outside of the standard (OIE iStart) process if it\u2019s a life or death matter. \n\nOIE deals with a huge spectrum of situations \u2014 from processes that are completely passive / routine / non urgent, to legit emergencies that can quite literally put students at risk of deportation, accusations of immigration fraud, or multi-year bans from returning to the US if they don\u2019t get immediate support. I think a mistake that several of us former or current F-1s made/make when dealing with OIE is to not seek support outside of the standard channels when in these urgent situations. The iStart system doesn\u2019t reliably auto-detect levels of urgency, an actual human being has to look at it and say \u201coh shit, this is bad\u201d.\n\nIf you objectively do need *immediate* help, you\u2019ll get help very quickly if you rock the boat. At least this is what I experienced when I went through a couple of nightmare scenarios that completely messed up my immigration status. I would find a way to email an OIE staffer directly \u2014 but again, only for *status-threatening emergencies*, and be polite. Otherwise, for routine (although still stressful) things like needing a new I-20 to travel or work, your need is always going to take a backseat to those of other people who are in situations that put them at risk of losing their immigration status / their ability to finish their degree. That\u2019s just the reality of dealing with an understaffed office that handles both routine paperwork and emergency situations. \n\nTech needs to give OIE a *much* bigger budget, I\u2019ve been saying this for ten years by now. I\u2019ve never gone out of my way to check if their budget is publicly available information \u2014 if so, it should be compared to the budgets of equivalent departments at peer institutions. That\u2019s worth looking into if someone else has the time.\n\nedit: fixed typos",

Always assume that they will take 2-4 weeks to process everything. If they get it done before that, great. If not, it would be fine since you give them plenty of time before the deadline. When you get stuff back, like newly issued I-20, make sure every bit of information is correct before you accept it.  \nAlso, they don't know shit about laws and regulations. Do a lot, and I mean a lot, of research on your own. Save every document and every email transaction including the timestamps in case there is any problem down the line.\n\nI have not had any problems (Went through CPT process 4 times as of now, I-20 travel signatures, SSN, etc.) with them. I try to limit my communication with them so I don't get frustrated by how dumb they can be. Drop-in advising is pretty much a waste of time.\n\nThey take their own time, but you can only control things you can. So, be patient, organized, and give them at least 2-4 weeks.  \nHope this was somewhat helpful lol. If you have any questions feel free to DM me.",

That specific app indeed does not work with recent versions of Android and is (as far as we know) no longer maintained by its developers. If memory serves, it throws a less-than-helpful error message if you do try and use it today in the setup process. \n\nThere is a successor to that app which _is_ actively maintained called [\"geteduroam\"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.eduroam.geteduroam) which _does_ work on Android 14. I just ran through it on a Pixel 6a running Android 14 and it worked without any issues. \n\nWe have [a knowledge article](https://gatech.service-now.com/home?id=kb_article_view&amp;sysparm_article=KB0029073) that links to the correct/working app, and also provides specific instructions on manually configuring a connection to eduroam on Android if so desired. \n\nWe *strongly* recommend using the [\"geteduroam\"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.eduroam.geteduroam) app because it easily and properly configures your device to automatically validate the security certificate used when authenticating to eduroam. If you pick \"Do Not Validate\" for \"Online Certificate Status\" (which fewer and fewer Android devices are offering these days), you run the risk of potentially exposing your GT account credentials to a malicious unofficial eduroam network. If you don't want to use the app, that's fine - the KB article linked above also provides the necessary information to validate the certificate's authenticity on the device's first connection to eduroam.",

The program doesn't impact transcripts or provide credits. Is it worth the five weeks for potential academic and corporate exposure, or should I start college in the regular Fall 2024 semester?",

A lot of that was self-imposed and I felt like the standard I was held to was definitely unfair and higher than that of my white peers (it's no one's 'fault' per se, just a reality of representing a school in the south - and I'm FROM Atlanta). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI included me being South Asian because I can empathize with this person -they're probably feeling attacked and when you already feel like you need to be 'perfect' to be able to have this kind of opportunity, it can be shitty because you already have enough things to deal with.

That being said, in the real world, *all* employees and **especially** social media content managers for corporations, sports teams, and the like have to follow rules around what they're allowed to post on social media in a official capacity when representing the entity and what they're allowed to post when representing themselves.\n\nPut another way, if I was the social media marketing manager for American Express, I wouldn't necessarily be putting a fit check on AmEx's instagram account when advertising a new card offering. AmEx doesn't have to have super stiff social media marketing as an alternative though. There's likely a happy medium in between where this IG account can feature stories and authentic (and fun!)  perspectives of many students across the student body instead of just the perspective of this one student. It could almost be run like a gonzo-esque look into what real life as a student looks like within the boundaries of what would be considered appropriate to show in front of parents.\n\nLong story short, I don't really think she's hurting anyone by tagging herself in stories/including her content about herself and some people here *are* clutching their pearls/overreacting BUT I think self promotion seems out of scope and unprofessional for a social media account for an institute of higher education and don't think many social media teams in the corporate world would approve of that approach. **Ultimately, you are being employed to do a service for the school and document the student body as well as get prospective students to engage with us. Using the brand to promote yourself and your own personal account is unprofessional and wouldn't fly if you were to try and do this as a career once you graduate.**\n\nWho cares though... it seems like there are way more important things that deserve our attention these days anyway.",

I don't mind her running the account, I just think the way she (and I'm saying this is her here because she is the one posting, but I'm sure there are other people on the team instructing her on what they want, no college would let one of their students run the social media account with absolutely no over sight) is trying to make it more personal is not the right fit for our audience",

That said, I'd be willing to bet we will reach full circle when GenAI models become more accessible and make it easy to make a \"professional\" looking post using your org's branding instantly instead of waiting on designers to produce batches of posts.",

That notification was very exciting to get, as Georgia Tech is in my top tier of grad school destinations due to the program ranking. All the professors I've talked to there have been helpful and kind.\n\nAmong the rest of the research I've been doing about grad school destinations, I've been looking at the subreddit for each school. I have to say that out all the schools I've looked at, the vibes here on /r/gatech are by far the worst.\n\nGoing based on posts here:\n\n * Pretty much all students are in a really unpleasant headspace and/or deeply dissatisfied with their current life situation\n\n * Campus infrastructure is poor to the point of really noticeable hits to quality of life\n\n * Dining on campus is intolerable, not just uninspiring\n\nIt seems like on the vast majority of posts there will be at least one current student deeply aggrieved about their experience at Tech. Of course everyone is entitled to their opinion and everyone has a different experience, but the negative posts seem so frequent and intense that they give me pause about spending years of my life in that sort of environment.\n\nSo, be truly honest for the sake of an outsider. Are the in-person vibes at Georgia Tech really as miserable as this subreddit can make it seem? Or is it just that Reddit is a safe place to vent?",

He's having a decently good time. Don't misunderstand, he's still got a lot of stuff to do between classes and TAing and research with not enough hours in the day, and he has the usual complaints about some labmate or another, but on the whole he's doing fine. He's not actively talking about it because there's not much to talk about, everything is just...fine.\n\n\nThat said, I think the complaints you raise are kinda irrelevant. Campus infrastructure is totally fine. The building may be dated architecturally but all the lab equipment is in good shape because the PI cares about keeping it that way and puts grant money towards it when needed. Campus housing and dining may be unappealing, but who cares? Atlanta is a major city with world class food and housing; you're not an undergrad, go live off campus!\n\n\nWhen you pick your lab, make sure you're picking your PI. The professors who want to work you to death will tell you so. The professors who respect your work life balance will tell you so. Don't ignore people when they tell you who they are. Talk to the professors, talk to the current students, and pick the vibe you want.\n\n\nIf you're looking for an active social life you can find one. There are grad groups who go out for drinks every week. There are sports games and tailgates if that's your thing. You can find a vibrant social life if you look for it.\n\n\nDon't base your opinion of the school on a bunch of reddit posts. Every grad program is going to be work, and a top tier program like GT is going to be a lot of work. But the school itself is no worse than any of it's top tier peers.",

I think most people dont know the city but also dont know how to find things to do, so if you propose something, someone might be interested. \n\nSome advice for undegrads does not work with graduate students since you are not living on campus. In my experience joining any of the clubs was terrible because people coudnt keep a conversation beyond 3 phrases, and their interests are very different.\n\nI keep in touch with a lot of people that I met on the first week events, but you have to propose activities and actually get their contact somehow..I feel instagram is better for that IMO",

Excellent opportunities for student orgs, research involvement, connections to industry, etc etc. If you connect with a professor you can often get a TAship as a master's student as well, which comes with a tuition waiver.\n\nIf you are a PhD student, I strongly recommend you go elsewhere. AE is notorious for underpaying students (w.r.t. other universities and even other departments at GT), and recent efforts from the AE GSA to increase the PhD stipend were shot down by the AE faculty. For perspective, PhD students in CS and IC make $3,000-$3,200/month (pre/post quals), while AE and ME students make $2,500 (was $2,400 until this past fall). If you have a car, or average student loans, or medical concerns, or a pet, you will be living paycheck to paycheck. A large proportion of AE PhD students rely on financial support from family to make it through their PhD. AE also does not guarantee funding WHILE ALSO not guaranteeing an advisor, which means if you don't have a TAship or GRAship by early fall, you are on the hook for ~$15k/semester tuition.\n\nVery few departments at top universities hold PhD students to such little regard.

If you're planning to live in grad housing on campus, it's  something to be aware of, but not a dealbreaker.  Food on campus is just okay. So you are possibly seeing those issues amplified here.\n\nAll that said, the AE program is highly respected .  See if you can speak to some grad students in the program. Visit the campus if you haven't done so. The things you want to focus on  will vary depending on whether you are a masters  or a doctoral student .\n\nBest of luck!

Some of it has to do with GT and its systems but for many student their personal/professional life just isn't there yet and it's frustrating being a grad student. You work hard but don't see any real fruits from it. If you don't have anyone in your life or at least some immediate family to talk to, life can get difficult.\n- Many students complain that the admin and logistics are slow. Infrastructure can be poor, but I haven't noticed it being a significant problem. Logistics and admin are slow, but again I'm pretty tolerant of it so it doesn't get my goat.\n- I don't know how many grad students actually dine on campus. You should learn how to cook some decent recipes. There are many great restaurants in Atlanta but there are many bad ones as well that are still highly rated for some reason. I'm looking at you, Tacos &amp; Tequilas. There are several others like this. You don't get good pizza in Atlanta unless you really look (thankfully Atwoods is nearby). It's hard to find a decent deli (Reuben's in downtown is great, but far from Tech). Your food options will be limited, even outside Tech dining.\n\nAll in all, you'll have a decent experience and meet cool people if you have a good social support system (at least an immediate family you're close with, which I thankfully have). If you don't have that, it's really tough being stuck in the South for the extended duration of grad school, especially if you're not from here. It can get lonely.",

It really is a once in a lifetime experience and I miss it all the time. \n\nI initially had similar concerns about missing out on my first semester at Tech and making friends coming back in Spring, but you build a strong friend group with your other study abroad students. It's a group of about 40-50 students and you end up getting really close, especially during the travel portion when you're on the bus A LOT.  During the following Spring semester they typically put all the returning FYSA students in the same dorm so you have a community right away coming back to Tech. My closest friends at Tech are all study abroad friends. And if you're looking to join clubs, they're no harder to join in Spring semester as 95% of clubs have Spring recruiting. \n\nAs far as courses go, classes aren't too bad. You'll take two classes for the first 6 weeks and two for the second 6 weeks so it's easy to manage the workload. You still have to dedicate time to them, but there is more than enough free time to travel (its honestly a travel program with a side of school lol). \n\nDoing a study abroad in your first semester also has the advantage of minimal impact to your degree map. You're also not tied down by clubs, research, jobs, or things like that. \n\nIt's a really awesome program and if you like travel I highly recommend it.  Just lmk if you have more questions!",

You'll end up taking 15 credits for the program (at least in my year). \n\nThe first three weeks you take a health class which is a Tech requirement that you'll be able to get out of the way. \n\nThe 6 weeks at Oxford you'll choose two classes. My year we had English 1 and 2, Differential Calc., History, and a Comp Sci class to choose from. \n\nDuring the travel portion we took two humanities classes (not to be confused with social science classes) which you won't have a choice on. (So, if you are coming in with humanities credits, they could be redundant. Check [Core Area C | Georgia Tech Catalog (gatech.edu)](https://catalog.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate/core-curriculum/core-area-c/) and  [Core Area E | Georgia Tech Catalog (gatech.edu)](https://catalog.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate/core-curriculum/core-area-e/) to see what counts as humanities or social sciences. You need 6 humanities credits and 12 social science credits at Tech)\n\nFor me, I already had credits that satisfied the humanities requirement of my degree, so the two travel portion classes became fall through credits. My degree wasn't lengthened, but it's definitely a little tighter. The hardest part is just sorting out prerequisites since your map will be a little scrambled compared to the norm. That being said I didn't come in with a lot of credits, so my degree was already extremely tight.\n\nTLDR: depending on your credits it can make your degree map tight (and in rare cases extend it by a semester), but it entirely depends on your major and what credits you have coming in. That being said even though my degree map has been somewhat tightened, it was absolutely worth it to study abroad.",

My BS was in a related, but not identical field. I was also coming from a less academically demanding school where I had been one of the better performing students in my major. In hindsight, I was also a little academically burnt out going into grad school. \n\nAll of that was a recipe for me getting my absolute ass kicked by the expectations of my coursework. I went from being one of the top students at my old school, to being probably at the bottom of my program at the beginning. It was an absolute ego blow. I made the mistake of trying to figure everything out on my own, and continued to do the same things even when they clearly weren\u2019t working. \n\nI ended up getting a D in a core class, which got me on academic probation. It was the lowest point in my life. I felt like an absolute failure. There were days where I questioned if life was worth living. \n\nI ended up taking a year off to decide if grad school was for me. During that time, I came to terms with the fact that there will always be someone smarter or better than you, and you shouldn\u2019t let it crush you when you encounter these people. I also had a little time to reset the academic burnout. \n\nI decided to return after a year, dedicated to finishing my MS. This time, when I had issues grasping something, I didn\u2019t try to grind it out myself. Instead, I figured out who was the best in the class and asked them, \u201cHey, I\u2019m having a little trouble wrapping my head around this. Mind helping me understand?\u201d  No one was ever a jerk, and this approach single-handedly got me through some of the tougher classes. And even if they are just a jerk, oh well. Some people are jerks.   But \n\nHonestly, despite how hard it was at the time, I\u2019m really glad I went through it.  It kinda destroyed my ego. I\u2019m no longer bothered when I meet someone who\u2019s better at something than me. There are 7.9 billion people in the world, at least one of them is gonna beat you. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever accomplished and I\u2019m proud of it.",

I transferred my PhD program (Mechanical Engineering) from University of Michigan to Georgia Tech for Aerospace Engineering in 2014 Summers. \n\nBased on my experience, grad school is not easy for most people especially in any academically demanding school. I feel stressed out in both UM and Georgia Tech. One thing I do think Georgia Tech is much better than UM is the weather. The extremely cold winter in Ann Arbor made me depressed much more easily than in Atlanta. \n\nThe other two biggest differences were: (1) I had a better advisor and (2) my research field was much more interesting here.\n\nThe qualifying exam was hard and very low passing rate in School of Aerospace Engineering. Once I passed it, I realized the more challenging thing was my own research. I had stuck in the same place for 4 months, which wasn\u2019t the worst for PhD students as I know.\n\nI was so stressed out and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder while preparing for my qualifying exam. I called school health center emergency line for help in an evening. I felt hopeless and thought about ending my life for a second. I was glad that I made that call.\n\nThe mental health and support system in Georgia Tech may not be the best in this country. But it\u2019s not that bad. As I know, the school tried to improve the mental health support system every year.\n\nIf you feel you need help, please go ask for help. We are human beings. We are not unbeatable. As long as you want, there are people out there offering support.\n\nI don\u2019t know what you are being through right now. But please don\u2019t give up.",

It's just a symptom of my social anxiety.\n\nI never get tremors at work though because I usually work with old guys and I don't want to befriend them the way I wanted to with my peers and professors at school. I never had that tremor issue before until I got into engineering, because I feel like there's so much pressure to know what you're talking about.

The physical effects though are very very infrequent and that's because I don't overwork myself anymore. When I was going through my master's and working, the stress was a lot to deal with. I also didn't have a support system in Georgia, I moved here for school and was immediately busy. The people I met at work for the most part did not share my ideals and I didn't feel like I could be more than coworkers with them as a result.\n\nToday I still work there but the group of people I directly work with has changed, they are more similar to me in terms of ideals and interests and are much kinder.\n\nBeing around people who you can be yourself around is very therapeutic.\n\nNot overworking yourself allows you to take time for self care so that you don't have all that stress build up.\n\nAnd then also, I worked projects as a technical lead, which forced me to be more assertive and challenge myself. This allowed me to build my self esteem and see that I was as capable of succeeding as my peers were. I had two problem team members who were very aggressive, one would yell and cuss me out. and after trying to deal with it on my own for a very long time I finally broke down and cried, wrote an email to my supervisor about what I was experiencing and said I would continue working as the lead but only talk to the guy who was giving me trouble in writing. My supervisor was very supportive. Knowing that I had people at work who would help me handle more hostile employees was a relief. I had come into that job thinking that I would be othered by most of my peers as a woman of color and just have to deal with it. But my supervisor was really cool and eventually I made it into a team of developers who are more professional and kind.\n\nSo my advice is, be kind to yourself and take care of your mental/emotional/physical health, distance yourself from toxicity whenever possible, find people you can trust and talk to them, and don't be afraid to speak your mind because nobody knows everything all the time.\n\nIf I could do the masters at tech again I still would. It was painful but paid off eventually. And now that I am past it I intend to do more to enjoy life instead of working all the time.",

Its a good location though, I would recommend getting a room in SHELL, not Nelson. Shell seems to be in much better condition overall, but is slightly further from laundry.

MFCC costs $5 per session without insurance, but the drawback is you're scheduled with their grad students who are doing a 1-year clinical evaluation with you and all their other patients. You don't get an ACTUAL therapist. I got to MFCC. My first therapist was great, my second I've struggled with but I'm finally learning some stuff from. \n\ngood luck w whatever you do",

I could definitely tell the therapist I had wasn't as well-trained and skilled as other therapists I've had that had multiple years of experience under their belt, but it was helpful. Best of all, back then at least they didn't really care if you paid or not, it's not like they'll send you to collections or hunt you down or anything, so if you're really low on money it's nice.",

There are a lot more RSOs at UIUC and most graduates come out of UIUC with jobs in the Midwest and California. Champaign is nice but UIUC\u2019s location is rather isolating and there isn\u2019t much outside of college life that\u2019s going on. Want to see a concert? Got to drive 2.5 hours to Chicago for that.  GT is located in a city, and has a lot of connections within the Southeast. A lot of employers have headquarters around you which is a benefit. Not a whole lot of bars that are geared toward college students. Much more going on. There is easy airport access which is wonderful. At UIUC you got to pay 40 bucks for a 3 hour bus ride to get to O\u2019Hare in Chicago. \n\nAll that being said, both programs are really prestigious and ranked around the same. It all depends on whether you prefer city life or traditional college town life surrounded by corn fields.",

        "selftext": "Hello!\n\nMy name is Alex, and I\u2019m a transfer student from Clayton State University into Georgia Tech for Computer Engineering! I transferred in on the conditional pathway during Summer 2023, and wanted to help other prospective students by making a guide on how to navigate the transfer system at Tech!\n\n***I want to go ahead and preface this by saying that there will be alot to read***, and Tech's requirements may change as time moves on - so some of this information may be little out of date. Therefore please double check any questions you may have with either the admissions website or a quick email/phone call to an admissions officer! ***I'm also not involved any way with the admissions office whatsoever***, and this is just an accumulation of information I've gathered over two years of trying (and succeeding) to get into Tech!\n\n&gt;**If you spot any errors (and can provide links to sources) in this article - please don't hesitate to point them out and I'll gladly give you credit!** Typos or bad advice included! My goal is to make this a one stop shop for prospective students to read after getting in, and that starts with a community effort of making this better!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Also, please don't hesitate to ask questions in the comments that you feel I didn't answer here** \\- I'll gladly try my best to respond, and even add them to the FAQ's section once I get a solid and verifiable answer!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What do I do now?\n\nAs I mentioned previously, I was accepted into Tech under the Conditional Pathway from Clayton State. However, my transition into college was not nearly as easy as it should have been. For a lot of y\u2019all, the next steps will be to find a suitable school to get your credits and transfer from!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background (Feel free to skip to the next bolded title!)**\n\nBelieve it or not, this was single handedly my biggest issue heading into life as a college student. This was due to everyone\u2019s nemesis in highschool - standardized testing. On a cold Monday morning in early February 2022, I awoke to a dreadful email from the ACT stating that my test that I had taken almost 2 months previously had fallen off a delivery truck and was lost. They provided me with a template to send to schools on my behalf apologizing for their oversight - as if anyone would believe an email from a student\u2019s email address. And gave me a free test retake, which was already 1 month overdue for Tech and another school I had applied to on the West Coast. What this also did was quite literally screw me for financial aid in Georgia, since the Zell-Miller scholarship required an ACT score of 26 or better. Leaving me with months of hard work and studying down the drain since the deadline to apply was already over with the ACT\u2019s next grading window. But it wasn\u2019t just me affected by this negligence, hundreds of other students had their scores lost too - [and I was even interviewed on the local news](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/henry-county-teen-says-he-never-received-college-admission-test-scores)!\n\nThis left me practically paralyzed, as I had no way of proving to colleges in my area that I could handle a college workload at a level tech would take in time for me to transfer.\n\nI\u2019m not telling you this sob story to scare you, I\u2019m telling it as a story of compassion and warning - since looking back there were so many things I wish I would have known before I started college!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Before I apply to other schools, what should I know?**\n\nFirstly, unless you have an older brother/sister or close cousin that can help you out with the admissions process - you\u2019re going to be on your own here. And while it may sound super scary - especially coming from highschool where your advisor likely picked the classes you took and made your schedule - I\u2019m here to let you know that I\u2019ll do my best to help get you started!\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already done it, [your first and foremost thing you\u2019ll need to do is get the FAFSA done!](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) You should have already been prompted to do this when you applied to Tech, but if not - get this done ASAP!\n\n* ***For Georgia Residents***\n\nIf you\u2019re a Georgia resident, go ahead and count your lucky stars! As you\u2019re in a minority of Tech\u2019s applicants, and now get to experience all my tips and tricks!\n\nFirstly, [do not enroll at a TCSG school!](https://www.tcsg.edu/find-a-college/) In the state of Georgia, these are state owned and operated trade schools (like for welding or cooking) - not community colleges where you can go and get credits on the cheap! You will have advisors lie to you about the transferability of credits, as it happened to me. The TCSG is a different educational branch from the USG (the one that oversees Georgia Tech). You\u2019ll need to be looking into enrolling at a USG school - ***if you\u2019ve already signed up for schools like Kennesaw State, u\\[sic\\]GA, GSU,*** [***or any one of these schools listed here***](https://www.usg.edu/institutions/) ***- you\u2019re okay and can skip the next paragraph!***\n\nIf you did enroll in a TCSG school, [you need to visit this page and cross reference the transferability of credits](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_location). You\u2019re in a really tight place here since you might not be able to take all your credits at a TCSG school - since from my understanding, you\u2019ll likely only be able to take classes GT considers remedial (like college algebra, precalculus or Algebra based Physics). I\u2019d highly recommend you figure out an exit strategy to a USG school, since GT is incredibly picky about the classes they\u2019ll take and the admissions department is really unforgiving about these requirements. For example, taking precalculus (because that's all they offer) and hoping that Tech will take it over Calc 1, will not work and will get you rejected! Your only other option is trying to cross enroll at a USG school to get those credits, but this process is incredibly messy and convoluted.\n\n***Tips and Tricks for Instate Students***\n\n*I\u2019d highly encourage you to not go to a bigger USG school - like KSU, u\\[sic\\]GA, or both GSU\u2019s.* This is because, while the transfer pathway from those schools to tech is more established; [if you miss your pathway and want/need to REPP transfer into Tech](https://www.usg.edu/committees/view/regents_engineering_pathways), your chances of getting in from those schools will be lower since there are more people fighting you for your stop. Consider smaller USG schools, especially those at the \u201cState University\u201d level. I\u2019d recommend staying away from \u201cState Colleges\u201d since those schools typically don\u2019t offer all the classes you need every semester. [But it\u2019s okay since schools at this level participate in a system called eCore!](https://ecore.usg.edu/courses/course-descriptions/) These are entirely online classes, that are often taught by professors at other USG schools - these courses are incredibly cheap and easy to pass! During my time at Clayton State, I took 3 eCore classes and loved it! I\u2019d highly recommend eCore for students still needing credits for English, or Physics 1 during the spring semester.\n\nLastly, [get in touch with your REPP advisor!](https://www.usg.edu/committees/view/regents_engineering_pathways) These are people who are here to help you - and despite not being pathway advisors, still know the transfer system inside and out! *(Shout out to Dr. Catherine Matos of Clayton State! She was my REPP advisor and is literally the only reason I\u2019m at Tech thanks to her awesome advising coming out of the ACT fiasco I mentioned earlier! For anyone in the south Atlanta area and looking for colleges to start at, I\u2019d highly recommend Clayton State University - and getting in touch with Dr. Matos ASAP! She will be a fantastic way to guarantee your success in college! She\u2019s seriously one of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met in college, and would give you the shirt off her back if it means she can help you.)* These are seasoned advisors who know the classes you need to take, have back channels to Tech\u2019s admissions department to ask questions, and can help get you in touch with other students also looking to transfer! Network and enjoy your time at this school! Take a part-time job, learn good study habits, and even TA for classes you enjoy if time allows! Remember this time is not about getting to Tech, but preparing for Tech - that\u2019s why their requirements are so high.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* ***For Out-of-state Residents / Internationals***\n\nYou need to check out OSCAR\u2019s transfer portal, [if your school is accredited by the SACSCOC](https://sacscoc.org/) \\- most of your 1000/2000 level classes should transfer into Tech. But if not, you\u2019ll need to check each semester before you register for classes to see what Tech tells you to take. Please note that if you\u2019re enrolled at a community college in a state far away like Arizona or California - and can\u2019t find a simple gen-ed to fulfill a non-essential class requirement like English. Get in contact with the admissions department ASAP as they\u2019ll likely be able to give you written feedback that they\u2019ll accept an otherwise non-acceptable class as fulfilling!\n\nIf you can\u2019t find a necessary class like Calculus 2 that will transfer to Tech, you need to contact the admissions department right away to get that squared away ASAP. Remember, when in doubt - always contact Tech\u2019s admissions department! (Phone calls are usually the fastest way when it comes to communicating with them, but emails allow you to get a paper trail).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* ***For Everyone***\n\n***Pathways are not Holistic,*** ***and admissions only cares about three things - the classes you\u2019ve taken, the credits you have, and your GPA.*** Notice that I separated \u201cthe classes you\u2019ve taken\u201d, and \u201cthe credits you have\u201d. This is because Tech also requires that you apply for entry into your sophomore year or later, so they require that you take at least 30 credits after highschool graduation. AP or CLEP credits do not fulfill this requirement - and Tech will know if you try to pass them off as classes you\u2019ve taken at your transfer school! This leads me to the next category, \u201cthe credits you have\u201d - while yes, Tech does want to see 30 post-high school credits, you can totally use credits from your AP tests as credit for classes, you just need to do it wisely and make sure that you don\u2019t run out of transferable classes! For example, if you took AP Calc and got credit (even if it's a 3) as long as your transfer school will take it - feel free to use it and skip calc 1 or 2! You\u2019ll just need to make sure that any classes you do take will transfer to Tech, and can be used to fulfill those 8-9 credit hour gaps that skipping a math sequence gives you. [Tech wants to also see 30 transferable credits, this is separate from the 30 post-high school requirement!](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/conditional-pathway) (I used a link for the Conditional pathway, but it's the same requirement for all pathways) This means if your AP credits transfer, or you can CLEP a class for credit, you should be able to fulfill this requirement easily - as long as you\u2019ve taken 30+ credits post highschool.\n\nLastly is your GPA, Tech needs a minimum of a 3.3 STEM GPA, and a minimum of a 3.3 overall GPA. This means you cannot expect to make a C in both Calculus I/II, and pad your GPA with easy arts classes. For in state students - if you're interested in knowing what classes count as a STEM GPA, try to find somewhere in your university where it list\u2019s HOPE (or USG) STEM GPA. These are typically counted by Tech as STEM classes for the purposes of GPA calculations. [You may also be able to check out this directory to find more classes at your school Tech considered STEM](https://apps.gsfc.org/securenextgen/dsp_stem_course_listings.cfm).\n\nThis pretty much covers the basics - I\u2019d also recommend you go ahead and make sure you know what classes you\u2019ll be taking in the fall. Have this in writing, as most universities love setting prerequisites high to milk more money from you for classes you don\u2019t need. So just because you took Calculus in highschool, doesn\u2019t mean your advisor will want/let you take calculus in the fall. If this is the case with you - you need to try to find a way to talk to someone and get them to perform a \u201cfaculty prerequisite override\u201d. Use those words exactly, and explain your situation with your pathway and time restraint. Otherwise, you might need to take a precalculus class over the summer like I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Should I even bother transferring to Tech?\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a pathway - congratulations! Tech sees you as an accomplished student, and just needs some more time to make room for you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **For Instate students**\n\nYou probably know Atlanta, consider yourself lucky as there are people who come here from the other side of the planet. [I'd highly recommend that you take a self guided tour if time allows](https://application.gatech.edu/register/selfguidedtour)! I'm going to keep this section light on purpose as you likely know Atlanta, or have family that knows Atlanta. Tech is in a bubble in midtown, and is usually very safe compared to the rest of the city.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **For out of state students**\n\nAtlanta is a wonderful city! Full of amazing people - you're probably now getting a little worried about the possible move to Georgia - and that's okay! I\u2019m here to help ease some of these concerns you may have.\n\nFirstly, let's address the elephant in the room and talk about student well being - and possible issues with racism being in the South. Georgia is a much different place than it was in your history books. Georgia is a purple state now, filled with a lot more different views and opinions - and alot closer to Florida\u2019s political landscape in the late 1990\u2019s to early 2000\u2019s (mostly progressive socially, but fairly conservative fiscally). Let me go ahead and state that Georgia Tech is an incredibly diverse school, and is typically always well above the pack when it comes to making ground breaking and influential decisions. *For example, Tech was the first school in the South to desegregate - peacefully, and without court order in 1961.* There was not even so much as a recorded \u2018peaceful\u2019 protest during this period against desegregation. The three brave men who first enrolled at our campus have a statue on campus, and mind you this all went down before Alabama\u2019s Governor George Wallace gave his famous \u201csegregation now, segregation forever\u201d speech in 1963. Ivan Allan, who the College of Liberal Arts is named after, is an Alum of Tech and was famous for stating as Atlanta Mayor that Atlanta was \u201cA City Too Busy To Hate\u201d.\n\nAtlanta was also the birthplace of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, and the civil rights movement. With that being said - I won't pretend that racism doesn\u2019t happen on campus, but when it does happen it\u2019s no more common than a normal college campus. I personally don't feel too entitled to speak on this topic, but I'd recommend you reach out to some student organizations on campus to get their opinion on things - [here's a link to the directory](https://gatech.campuslabs.com/engage/organizations)!\n\nLet's talk about Georgia\u2019s climate and some things you need to know about living in Atlanta. Firstly, Georgia\u2019s climate tracks closer to a swamp than a normal city. So expect a lot of humid and muggy days - for those of you coming in from China, I\u2019ve heard some of my international friends say that Atlanta\u2019s climate is basically that of Chongqing to give some point of reference.\n\nWhen discussing Georgia\u2019s climate, remember this phrase I heard from my grandmother - \u201cThere are two seasons in Georgia, summer - and christmas\u201d. Expect cost of living to be higher than a college town but lower than a city like New York, Philadelphia, Boston, or San Francisco. Many students out of state students decide to go greek (rush a fraternity or sorority) due to the fact that it gives them more sense of home while studying at Georgia Tech - and also provides better food and (typically) better housing for less money.\n\nIf you expect to come into Tech and not need a car, please be aware that Atlanta is a very spread out city. So if you plan on getting outside of the city (or as locals call it - going OTP, outside the perimeter), expect needing a car. MARTA, Atlanta\u2019s public transit system - is very underfunded and is incredibly limited in its outreach. One of the few places it can go from campus however, is the airport - but this is the last stop on the Red line and it stays at ITP (Inside the perimeter).\n\nIf you do decide to bring a car, please be aware that parking passes are currently about $800 a year - so I\u2019d recommend visiting campus and seeing if you actually need one before committing. There is a Publix (a Southern chain of large grocery stores) across campus in midtown, so groceries will likely be a nonissue - especially if you plan on getting a meal plan while here.\n\nAlso, note that in the state of Georgia we offer tools for car owners that you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find elsewhere. The HERO/CHAMP programs - these are emergency response vehicles provided to you by the state free of charge for use. They are equipped with repair tools, patrol almost all parts of major highways in Georgia - and can easily be called through dialing 511 (the Georgia DoT\u2019s traffic reporting system) for help with anything from flat tires to accidents! (Fun fact, but they were created in 1994 for the Olympics - and were established in order to promote Southern Hospitality! These are men and women that work long, thankless, hours all to help us feel more safe on our roads.) You\u2019ll need to call HERO for most highways/interstates in Fulton county (the county containing Atlanta) - and CHAMP for highways outside of the metro area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What can I expect from Tech?\n\nFor most students, Tech functions just like a normal university. There are some of the brightest people here, and some people you'll have no idea what the admissions department was thinking.\n\nMost in-state students will also have been used to using D2L for their LMS (learning management system) at public colleges. However, Georgia Tech uses Canvas. Canvas is more user friendly, but also has features from lockdown browser built in - like off-tab detection, etc.\n\nTruthfully, I'm not sure what I can really put here besides what to look out for. Tech is a wonderful place, but it's what you make of it. There have been successful people that went to Tech, and successful people that didn't - I'd highly recommend that you not put so much pressure on yourself to get here. If you're happy at your previous school, that's great! You'll probably be happy here too, but there's no reason to force yourself to transfer if you feel that you won't be happy or won't take advantage of all the perks Tech has to offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# FAQ's\n\nThe following are FAQ's that I've seen a number of times on the admissions megathreads. I'll try my best to answer them below and update them as time passes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;My class isn't offered at my college, [but is listed on the major transfer requirement sheet](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major) \\- can I still get in without it?\n\nProbably not, GT is very picky about the classes they'll take and what they won't. You should reach out to the admissions department first before asking online since admissions can bend rules or find equivalent classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Are out of state students able to earn the HOPE/Zell scholarship? And how do I obtain Georgia residence?\n\nOut of state students are unable to earn the HOPE/Zell scholarship, or any state funded scholarship. In order to obtain Georgia residency, [you need to meet the requirements listed here](https://catalog.gatech.edu/financial/tuition/out-of-state-tuition-waivers/). Be aware that attempting to lie about your residency is considered fraud! The easiest way to earn in state residency under the age of 26 is by having your parents move (or buy property) in Georgia in order to file taxes here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I'm an instate student at another University, and a required class I need to take to make my pathway isn't offered during my next semester - what do I do?\n\nFirstly, don't panic! You're probably okay - [get in touch with a REPP advisor at your college and ask them what they think your next steps are](https://www.usg.edu/committees/view/regents_engineering_pathways). For 80% of your required classes, [you can also take them online through eCore as well](https://ecore.usg.edu/courses/course-descriptions/)!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;How do I plan for the classes to take before getting to Tech?\n\nThe new way: (credit to u/lolxdxdjklol for both creating this tool and letting me know about it!) [use TransferToGATech](https://www.transfertogatech.com/). Just punch in your school and desired major, and the tool will find almost all the classes you need to take in order to transfer!\n\nThe old way: make a spreadsheet - [find your classes listed on the major required courses page](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major), [and then use the transfer credit equivalency tool](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_location) to find out what course numbers are listed as equivalent to Tech's courses. Here is an example of my spreadsheet from my time at Clayton State:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h43sjfmv18fc1.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab4ff0cf16d56b6d533bbc37a67802248fc65480\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;How can I contact the admissions department?\n\n[You can contact them by going here](https://admission.gatech.edu/contact) and choosing to either email or call them. Calling typically gives you same day answers, while emailing allows you to form a paper trail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Can I switch majors after coming to Tech as a transfer?\n\nYes! You may have seen something from GT about how transfer students can't change their major - however this is only for transfer students who've earned less than 30 credits at Tech. Unlike freshman entry students, transfer major's must earn the permission of their destination major. This can either be fairly easy for majors not in much demand (such as LMC, Public Policy, etc) - or very difficult and competitive (for CS, MechE, CompE, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I got an arts and sciences pathway for GT - can I switch my major after coming here for CS or engineering?\n\nNo, you won't be able to switch your major into any engineering or CS program once you accept your offer under arts and sciences. However, there is a loophole - Math majors at GT can double major in CS and gain automatic admission into the program. Math is covered by the arts and sciences pathway, so this may be the way to go if you're okay with taking a few more semesters to graduate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Are pathways guaranteed entry?\n\nEffectively yes, there is no reason you should pick a non-competitve major (like Public Policy or LMC) if you've got a pathway offer that covers your desired major. As long as you've meet the requirements I listed above, you'll earn a secured spot at Tech for your major.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Does my major at my old school affect my ability to transfer to Tech? As in, do I need to be a mechanical engineering major at my old school in order to apply to Tech as a Mechanical Engineer?\n\nNo, your major at your old school has no effect on your ability to transfer to Tech. You could, in theory apply to Tech as an English major and be granted entry for Electrical Engineering as long as you meet the prerequisites listed above.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note though that not all majors are created equally, and it\u2019s important to pick a major at your university that allows you to complete all prerequisites in a timely fashion. *Instate students on Zell-Miller or HOPE should enroll in a major that requires the classes Tech does to transfer, as those scholarships do not pay for non-required non-major classes.*\n\nWhen picking a major to transfer from, I'd recommend you choose something similar to the field you want to apply to Tech as. For example, choose biology if you want to transfer into Biomolecular engineering - or computer science for Electrical/Computer engineering. Math and Physics degrees also work if your university offers them, as they'll allow you to enroll in all the same Gen-Ed's GT requires.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I\u2019m on REPP, does community involvement (such as clubs, community service, etc) affect my transfer application?\n\nYes! When you apply on REPP, you\u2019re effectively placing yourself in a smaller pool of applicants - all competing for spots at Tech through a holistic review process. This means that things like community service, awards, and work experience will all make an impact on your likelihood of being accepted! From conversations with some admissions officers I've had at Tech however, work experience (this includes volunteer work) single handedly has the biggest impact on this category.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Help! Nobody is responding to me on the subreddit's megathreads! I'm not sure what to do as I have a specific question or need advice!\n\nDon't worry! I'd recommend you [reach out to the GT discord](https://discord.com/invite/gt), or call (not email) the admissions office as you should be able to get incontact with an admissions officer that same day via phone!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;My class isn't listed on the GT transfer table (or is listed as \"Departmental Review Required\"), what should I do?\n\nFirstly, please note that the table is not a definitive be all end all guide - all classes listed on your transcript are required to be reviewed by the registrar. As a result, save all of your syllabi! When the table lists \"Departmental review required\" - this just means the registrar hasn't seen this class before and needs to know what was taught and how it should evaluate it as. If the class you're taking isn't listed - that just means they haven't had a chance to update their internal database of classes yet.\n\nIf the class you need is required, or you're just concerned as it's not listed on the registrar's website - go ahead and contact admissions and see what they can say! When I was transferring into Tech (this policy may have changed), you should be able to start the review process early by contacting the admissions department before you submit your application!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

CS can only go into software, whereas it's very unlikely for a EE to get a software job.\n\nHope this helps! Please feel free to DM me with any more questions!",

Firstly, it\u2019s 100% worth it to move back to Georgia as your son would be eligible for the HOPE/Zell Miller scholarship and would have a significant chunk of his tuition taken care of! My friend is from New York, graduated in New York, but moved here while going to\nClayton State with me and earned the HOPE scholarship since they just need a high school transcript that\u2019s accredited.\n\nTo answer your question, [as per the out of state tuition waiver home page](https://catalog.gatech.edu/financial/tuition/out-of-state-tuition-waivers/):\n&gt; As of the first day of classes for the term, an economic advantage waiver may be granted to a U.S. citizen or U.S. legal permanent resident who is a dependent or independent student and can provide clear evidence that the student or the student's parent, spouse, or U.S. court-appointed legal guardian has relocated to the State of Georgia to accept full-time, self-sustaining employment and has established domicile in the State of Georgia. Relocation to the state must be for reasons other than enrolling in an institution of higher education. For U.S. citizens or U.S. legal permanent residents, this waiver will expire 12 months from the date the waiver was granted.\n\nIn other words, you\u2019ll need to establish residency in Georgia before the first day of your son\u2019s first semester. But you could always move down here over the summer, have him take 3 credits over the summer as an out of state student, and go back in the fall as a Georgia resident!\n\nHope this helps!

But yes you\u2019re correct, the biggest issue he\u2019ll have is finding classes at that point that are able to transfer. It\u2019s GT policy that the last 36 credits of a major have to be taken at GT, as a result they typically won\u2019t bother reviewing most 3000/4000 level courses. Meaning your son might need to retake classes in order to fit in the 30 credit requirement.\n\n[For a clear cut answer on what will transfer and what won\u2019t, check out the transfer equivalency table.](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_location)\n\nAlso, before I forget - make sure you have him save all former syllabi as he\u2019ll probably need them in order to have the registrar/department review credit! In the state of Georgia, all colleges must allow you to challenge registrar\u2019s not giving credit for classes - as a result, once he gets here he might be able to save a few semesters just by providing syllabi!",

Glad to hear that I could help!\n\nThe table is not a definitive be all end all guide - all classes listed on your transcript are required to be reviewed by the registrar. As a result, save all of your syllabi! When the table lists \"Departmental review required\" - this just means the registrar hasn't seen this class before and needs to know what was taught and how it should evaluate it as. Or in your case, if it's not listed - that just means they haven't had a chance to update their internal database of classes yet.\n\nIf the class you need is required, or you're just concerned as it's not listed on the registrar's website - go ahead and contact admissions and see what they can say! When I was transferring into Tech (this policy may have changed), you should be able to start the review process early by contacting the admissions department before you submit your application!\n\nHope this helps!

                "body": "u/rockenman1234 \\- Great post!  Lots of great info here.  I do have a question about AP credits, though.  My son (a current hs senior) recently received a conditional transfer pathway offer to GT for Summer 2025.  He's planning to attend Kennesaw State University in the fall of this year.  That said, he will likely have some AP credits going into KSU from high school classes/AP exam scores.  My question is, if KSU gives him credit for an AP class, and the KSU course equivalent meets one of the course requirements for his conditional transfer, can those KSU course credits (awarded on the basis of AP exam results) be used to meet course requirements for the conditional transfer to GT?   For example, he's taking AP Physics C this year.  Let's say he takes the AP exam and makes a 4 and KSU gives him credit for PHYS 2211.   Let's also say KSU's PHYS 2211 maps to GT's PHYS 2211 in the equivalency table.  If he's conditionally transferring into a major that requires PHYS 2211 as a requirement for the conditional transfer, does the credit from KSU (which originated from an AP exam credit) count?   I ask because KSU may have lighter rules on what they'll accept for AP credits than GT... but once the AP credit becomes an actual course equivalent on his KS transcript - I would guess that GT is no longer evaluating that credit like an AP credit and is simply evaluating it against the course equivalency chart between KSU and GT.   This probably sounds like a pretty convoluted question... but I think my son has at least a couple of AP classes like this.   Thoughts???  (p.s. I know the AP credits don't count toward the 30 hour requirement of post -high school college coursework - I'm asking specifically about the specific courses required by major to transfer  - see  [Transfer Course Requirements | Undergraduate Admission (gatech.edu)](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major) ).  Thanks !!!",

And congratulations to your son for getting a pathway - it\u2019s a huge achievement and I hope he\u2019s able to take advantage of it!\n\nTo answer your question, yes - you\u2019ll be able to use AP credit towards major specific admissions requirements! And as a bonus, if KSU gives him credit for 3\u2019s then GT will honor that as well! That\u2019s how I was able to get out of taking English 1101 at Clayton State, while also being able to transfer to Tech the next semester! I believe I made a 3 on the exam (which GT doesn\u2019t accept) but Clayton took it and gave me credit. As a result I could use the credit for ENGL1101 towards my transfer application. GT will also always award credit for sequence classes, so if he takes Physics 2 at KSU they won\u2019t pull his credit for PHYS2211 if they find out he didn\u2019t qualify for AP credit at Tech (which has never happened before).\n\nMy only word of advice is to be aware of the credit requirements for transfer applicants! If he gets a ton of AP credit, then there is a chance that he might no be able to take enough transferable classes post high school in order to qualify for the pathway! Look into other math classes, like linear algebra or discrete math (if required) to fill in that gap made by physics! He should reach out to KSU\u2019s REPP advisor and see what they recommend as well based on course load and credit obtained.\n\nBest of luck with admissions - and congratulations again to your son! Please let me know if you\u2019ve got any more questions!",

Beautiful courtyard, nice view of the pencil building, good location imo, larger kitchen than most on campus apartments, etc. but recently it has really gone down hill. \n\nThe elevators have been having constant issues. At least one is out of order at any given time. I noticed they haven\u2019t actually been inspected since 2022, which I suspect has something to do with that.\n\nThey installed new AED boxes all over the place with warnings saying they don\u2019t actually contain an AED, and they\u2019re \u201cworking on it.\u201d However, they\u2019ve been empty as long as I\u2019ve been here (~6 months) and probably longer. Hopefully this isn\u2019t a pressing issue and no one is going to be in need of one, but it just seems lazy and mildly unsafe to install the boxes with nothing in them and no sign of fixing it anytime soon. \n\nThere have always been issues with frequent fire alarms (I remember having the same problem when I lived here in 2020-21). But it has gotten much worse. We\u2019ve had 4 fire alarms in the last 2 days. 1 a.m., 5 a.m., 7 a.m. yesterday, and 9 a.m. today. Not only is this wildly inconvenient and annoying, it\u2019s unsafe. Very much a boy who cried wolf situation. The housing office sent out a message reminding us that we have to evacuate each time, and ensuring us that they are trying to fix the root cause. I find this hard to believe since there have been multiple similar instances over several years and no sign of progress. \n\nThe latest issue that\u2019s been bothering me is the intense construction. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a result of flooding due to the sudden cold snap we had a previous week. I understand that this probably wasn\u2019t planned, and that they have to do it. However, it smells dangerously awful and people are still living in this construction zone. Like, give you a headache make you nauseous type awful. We received no warning, no alternative accommodations or compensation. The walls are missing and the hallways is full of fumes. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s still livable but it\u2019s just a bit frustrating and almost comical atp how much gt Housing can slack off. \n\nTLDR: quality of life has plummeted @ NAN.

I was a student back then and many of the freshmen who started in fall 1995 were the first students to live in the building even though the apartments were slated to become used by Georgia State.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe general  gossip back then was that corners needed to be cut in order for construction to be completed in time for the Summer 1996 Olympics.  Students who live in the building had frequent complaints about shoddy workmanship and plumbing problems.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou don't really build a residence structure that tall with a 20 year expiration date.  More likely is that some of the components used... water pumps, hvac systems, etc probably have a 20 year service life before major replacement or maintenance is necessary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFire alarms being pulled is an undergrad (usually freshman) problem that has persisted at Tech since before I was a freshman.  As one PL we had put it....  \"some of your dormmates graduated high school without ever having a chance to act out and rebel at home...  and freshman year ends up being when they decide to do it\".   Could be students, could be salty visitors.",

However, due to the recent ban on CS transfer, my only option would be to transfer into CompE. \n\nIn terms of my interests, I am honestly open and flexible for both fields (as I don't know enough about the distinction yet except that it's mainly hardware vs. software) but know I don't want to work in robotics or the electrical side of things in CompE.\n\nI am pretty lost and confused about if I should just pursue CS at my state college or transfer into the CompE program at GT. Was also wondering how the job market outlook would be for CompE compared to CS and how the CompE threads of cybersecurity and distributed system &amp; software design or Cybersec. &amp; Systems and architecture would fair up to the industry?  \n\n\nthanks!",

In terms of job demand, your outlook is great in both fields. Of the two, I would encourage you to study whichever you have a higher proclivity to, or whichever you enjoy more. Degrees are temporary, careers last a lifetime, don't get too caught up on the titles, focus on what you're good at and enjoy learning.",

There will be about 630 high school students from 42 schools competing that day. If you were involved with Science Olympiad in high school and would like to meet with other SciOly alumni, or if you would just like to come hang out, please consider joining us on tournament day. You do not need to have been involved in Science Olympiad in middle or high school to volunteer.\n\nCurrently we are **a bit short-staffed** in terms of volunteers for the tournament, and due to that we have come back to the subreddit to ask fellow Jackets to help us out and volunteer.\n\nIn particular, we are looking for general volunteers to support event supervisors. General volunteers can volunteer for any amount of hours on tournament day, and most events are held in or around the CULC. If you are interested in being a general volunteer, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwDl2peNj8t3DZEaZh8bkGEmBVjCgOEJyPGc8Z12o_DYlkBg/viewform). It truly is a rewarding and fun experience where you can meet new people, and help the next generation gain a love of STEM.\n\nPizza (around noon), t-shirts, and snacks all day will be provided to all volunteers.\n\nIf you have any questions, please let us know at [scioly.gatech@gmail.com](mailto:scioly.gatech@gmail.com).

        "selftext": "Current GT student here, 3rd year.\n\nI did an internship and co-op at a National Lab that went very well, I lead a $100k project as PI. The National Lab expressed interest in putting me through a program where they pay for my MS in CS, and they said the BS/MS is a good program for that, as it only takes a year.\n\nNaturally, I was excited. I also saw that GT was the most common school for students in that program.\n\nI talked to my academic advisor about this program and was surprised by her answer:\n\nI was told that it was \"unlikely\" that I would be accepted and that my 3.7 GPA was \"low\".  \nWhen I asked for further comment, she told me that they \"only want top students\".\n\nI asked her if she could get more information, or if there were any people I could reach out to. I reinstated the importance of this for my long term career goals. I was told that I should not reach out to anyone involved in the BS/MS program, because they \"will only talk to students that have been admitted already\" - she mentioned that she couldn't tell me anything more because she could \"get terminated\".\n\nI am at a bit of a loss, I thought the requirement was a 3.4. I am also taken aback by the lack of transparency.\n\nI had been counting on getting into the BS/MS programming given my professional goals and for my future with the National Lab.\n\nI need to make an assessment about whether I have a realistic chance of being admitted into the BS/MS program or if I should focus on applying to other schools and could seriously use some advice about who I can reach out to, so I thought I'd post this.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I also had what I believe was a strong recommendation from a CoC faculty member. \n\nYou would miss out on being able to double count two classes, therefore having to take maybe an extra semester.

        "selftext": "I saw an email about this game and now I've gone down a very deep rabbit hole. I'm wondering why we're having a game all the way in Ireland, mainly because:\n\n1) Football is virtually non-existent outside of the US, so I'm surprised we're playing at a non-US venue. Idk something about a hoard of Americans going abroad to watch an American sport that the locals most likely know nothing about and do not engage in feels off to me.\n\n2) The game is on August 24, which I assumed is the weekend after classes start. So is the school expecting a lot of students to travel to Ireland and back all in the span of one weekend?\n\n3) Building off of point 2, I checked flight prices and saw they're around $1300 for a roundtrip (I used August 22 to 25). So is the school expecting students to somehow come up with that kind of money (considering that's up to the equivalent of 1 month's rent for most people) \\[P.S. I know GT can't do anything about flight prices, I just find it interesting that they think we'll pay so much just for a game that will most likely televised)",

He wanted to build a mask similar to that of Rorschach, a character from Watchmen. Essentially, it is a pattern changing mask that responds to temperature changes like when talking. It would simulate ink blot patterns and could be applied to other clothing articles as well. This technology surprisingly doesn't exist in the degree he wished to pursue, only being emulated used panels and rigid circuits.\n\nHe proposed this project to his professor at the start of the semester, and was accepted.\nHe presented his idea to the class, and again his semester, and was accepted and acquired teammates. (He named his team Rorschack)\nHe bid on his own project with his team, and was again accepted.\n3 weeks later, today actually, He was told that his project specifically could not be allowed. And the only reason given was \"we can't have something for just fashion purposes\" despite making clear every single time that the only currently planned application was fashion. Now they decide he can't.\n\nSo now, he wasn't even given the option to pick a new project, he was handed some project that no other team wanted. This is absolutely outrageous and completely antithetical to the purpose of capstone design.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the way he was told was his professor made 2 of his team members flip on the idea while he was in training for one of the spaces. He wasn't even present for the discussion, he simply showed back up and was told.\n\nHe was immensely passionate about this project, and worked hard these past 3 weeks researching and even buying tools needed. Taking this from him purely because \"fashion is not an application\" is a disgrace, especially considering the uniqueness of his concept here. A concept which is very doable according to his research.\n\nI am seeking immediate reapproval for my roommate's project, as well as an apology for even suggesting that his idea wasn't \"impactful enough\".\n\nI have emailed Dr. Jariwala, the dean of students, and the dean of the college of engineering.\n\nThe fact he was only told now after 3 separate proposals in which it was accepted, is egregious and puts him at a huge disadvantage.\n\nIf you would like to help my roommate, please also email the Dean of Students and Dr. Jariwala asking for Project Rorschach to be reinstated, and saying that Dr. Wayne Lee's actions are completely antithetical to the purpose of capstone and the commencement speech of \"you can do it\".",

I\u2019ve spoken to members in the group, and they have yet to find a non-fashion application. I don\u2019t think Wayne has done anything unexpected, a purely-fashion based project has never been approved before. It seems like your roommate was given leeway and time to fine a use case other than \u201cit looks pretty\u201d but his group was unable to do so.",

I hope your friend gets fair treatment and some recompense for the weeks wasted. \n\n1. This mask thing is not a feasible idea for the time and resource you have in capstone. The color change isn\u2019t going to be sensitive enough to tell you anything outside of binary contact/no contact info. Having methanol near the nose/eyes and touching skin (even if it\u2019s enclosed) is also not a great idea. \n\n2. Your friend\u2019s progress in coming up with a proper bid is not great. It took me less than a minute to google color changing mask and find a paper talking about special TEAL respirators with thermosensors to help with proper fitting. He could have done this day 1, saw this product, ID\u2019d the flaw (sensor is attached to respirator) and have his capstone project be: Development of a thermosenstive reporter to ensure proper fit of ANY respirator. Ta-dah. He gets his mask idea and it has a function outside of fashion. He could have even just had the proposed use as a stopgap bs thing just for the professor and change the application later. There is no good reason he and his entire team couldn\u2019t come up with a use in 3 weeks when I did with a single google search.",

That just really isn't who he is. He's extremely straightforward. He wouldn't do something like propose an application purely as a stopgap, even if it meant to work on his dream project.",

I'm sure it has more defined uses then fashion, but since fashion was so broad, and because fashion designers would honestly buy this if given the chance considering it hasn't been explored that much yet, they decided to stick with it for now.\n\nThey were planning on researching other applications as well, since they could easily change the colors of the patterns (instead of white and black, a fee other combinations he said would work). I'm sure there could be medical uses with using the shifting patterns, or maybe even military uses.\n\nEssentially it's just that fashion was what they had defined so far and talked with a company about the applications. And again, he did specify this in his proposals too.

OP even mentioned a couple possible reasons in one of their comments. Now they ran off half cocked with what sounds like only part of the story, escalated a situation they weren't a part of above Wayne's head, have made a pretty serious accusation about Wayne's character here, and if other members of the team were concerned about the project it's all a moot point anyways.\n\nFrom what I knew dealing with him, I don't think Wayne would retaliate over it. He always struck me as very fair and even keeled. But he would absolutely be justified in being pissed, especially if this post somehow gets across his desk. And I know there used to be some professors who would pop in here when I was at Tech, so I have no doubt somebody involved with the faculty has come across this post",

Its fixed now tho. Thing about laundry is you have to go outside for it since there's only 1 entrance and it's an outdoor one. It's still in the nelson shell building but you'll have to step out for it. Plumbing and ac are pretty decent, the ac is controlled using a dial and there aren't any numbers on it. Common rooms are pretty spacious and actually pretty nice.\n\nI've never had noise issues from outside, but depending on the side of the building you live on, you might? Also the first floor single digit side (think 101-109, not sure about the exact numbers but just the rooms on that side) has mold growing on the ceilings in the hallway, or at least it used to last year.",

        "selftext": "Hello! I'm currently in my fourth semester as a Computer Science major, with threads in Intelligence and Systems &amp; Architecture. I've been feeling, as the semesters have gone on, more comfortable with SysArch vs Intel (this may be because I haven't finished an Intel class yet \\[currently taking CS 3600\\]). The only reason I chose Intel in the first place was because of all the hype surrounding it, but seeing as how if I really wanna do an AI-oriented job in the field, I need to get a Masters/PhD in it (I'm not against doing that, \\[in fact, I love research\\] but I'm not sure if I could make that time/money commitment on something I might not be interested in).\n\nThat brings me to consider fully switching majors into Computer Engineering. How is it different from CS? For those who've graduated with a CompE major, how's the job market compared to CS? Should I, instead of switching majors, switch threads by exchanging Intel with Modsim? How easy would it be to transfer from CS to CompE?",

You can then pick another CmpE thread, one of three CS threads (Devices, Info, SysArch), or one of three EE threads(sig proc, telecom, or robotics).\n\nYou will also have to add on ECE 2040 (Circuit Analysis).",

GT doesn't want sick kids going around spreading germs lol - so I think they'll give 5 days off automatically, at least that's what I got last semester when I caught COVID.\n\nProfs aren't obligated to help, but almost all will lend a helping hand by extending due dates or giving you extra time to study for tests if you have one coming up. Your biggest issue will be catching up on missed material, that put me really far behind for the first test in Physics 2 last semester; and I really regret not doing more to make sure I had a good grasp on everything I missed.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nPS: Stamps should have free COVID testing covered through your tuition, I'd call them and check availability though!",

Yesterday however, it just started to refuse connecting to PS Network even though there were no issues on that side. So I wait till this morning to see if it improves and it doesn't. So following a recommendation I found elsewhere I disconnected from GTother and connected to my phones mobile hotspot and then it had no issues whatsoever. Reconnected to GTother and it proceeded to not work again. So has anyone had this issue before or currently having it? Did something GT did on their end screw something up?",

That team believed it was resolved yesterday afternoon, but this afternoon we got a couple of tickets from users on a small rural Georgia ISP that are still having trouble reaching GT resources. We don't have any other confirmed reports of connectivity problems related to this issue at the moment. \n\nYour PSN connectivity issues \\_could\\_ be related, though PSN is obviously not a small ISP.

Yeah the counters may look clean, but you just wiped stuff from the counter into the food. \n\nAlso the plates are usually dirty and I have to look through at least 5 plates to find one that\u2019s just acceptable. Why can\u2019t we just get paper plates?? My room mate wasn\u2019t paying attention last week and started drinking water from a \u201cclean\u201d cup with old rice inside it from someone else.\n\nAlso the workers like to spray chemicals to clean the tables right next to students eating which is a big no no. You spray the chemical and you get this cloud of bleach(or whatever chemical) in the air which could be getting on my food. I have had this a few times this semester alone. \n\nEven with all these problems, I wouldn\u2019t make a fuss about it if the plan was appropriately priced. I pay 2,850 a semester, $450 of it is dining dollars when you have the weekday plan.\n\n$2400 for 15 weeks, 5 days a week, is $32 a day. That is absolutely insane for the food options available and what I actually end up eating. \n\nFor $32 a day you can: \n\nEat 3 large panda meals.\n\nEat 2-3 twisted taco bowls.\n\nEat 5-6 deluxe chicken sandwiches at CFA.\n\nMake your own food and eat like a king. \n\n(note I probably wouldn\u2019t even eat as much as any one of the above plans in a day, which further adds to my point)",

Ok, now imagine you woke up much earlier, and had to shiver at a bus stop, and then walk in the frost, and then shiver, and so on, and then cook someone else's breakfast.\n\nI know we need food. This is a hard school. We all have hard work. However, that resentment you're feeling right now. Don't let it make you cruel to people. Smile at staff. Give them a thank you. As how you can help.

It's not acceptable for a dining hall to provide inedible food, or do anything that would fail health department inspections. \n\nI'm sure you yourself treat staff well - you thank them for the food they give you, you hold open a door for them when helpful, you treat them with the respect they merit.\n\nHowever, reddit threads like this often lead to dogpiling/brigading, and I think there's an importance to students being aware of just how hard people \\*do\\* work for them.",

It was much worse in the previous years... they even served rancid ground turkey meat once. \n\nNow what I do agree on is that the price of the meal plan is too much especially for freshmen.

I saw in another comment that you plan on taking it because you forgot a lot of the content, but I would think about whether or not you care more about being good at hand computation of linear algebra problems, or if you care about rigor and learning the content to a higher degree of understanding.\n\nIf you are looking for the latter, I would strongly suggest you take MATH 3406 (A Second Course in Linear Algebra) instead. This is more of an abstract linear algebra course that is proof based rather than computation based, and you'll come out with a much better understanding of linear algebra from an abstract algebra perspective. Instead of just talking about numerical problems and performing operations by hand, you will build up a fundamental understanding of each aspect of linear algebra, starting from defining vector spaces and ending with theoretically useful tools such as Jordan Normal Form and SVD. This type of class can be helpful if you decide to take higher level mathematics courses later down the road.\n\nThat said, please note I have zero idea what quant preparation is supposed to look like. It is entirely possible that proof-based mathematics won't be helpful for you, in which case 3406 may not be worthwhile.",

                "body": "An interesting catch-22.\n\nFirst of all, your offer of admission is for summer enrollment. That's the deal on the table. Many students in the regular application process coming from high school are offered summer admission rather than fall. They do this to stagger classes and accommodate as many new students as possible.\n\nSecond,  if you enroll here for summer, Tech doesn't allow you to be a transient student elsewhere while being enrolled at Tech, so you wouldn't technically be able to accept your offer of summer admission without enrolling for summer classes here. And if they do admit you for fall instead, you haven't officially matriculated into Tech so you wouldn't actually be considered a transient student in the summer at that other school.\n\nYou need to talk to your admissions rep to try to work this all out, but be prepared for a \"no\" or for mutually exclusive conditions for what you want to do. I'm sure you're not the first to ask this of Tech admissions.",

Lectures were recorded as well.

        "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI am a 4th year student currently living in NAN. I\u2019d really like to stay in NAN next year when I do my BSMS. However, I just realized the only options listened for graduate housing are the tenth &amp; home buildings. Ironically, the graduate living center isn\u2019t even included as an option. Is that really the only option? The location of 10th &amp; home is not ideal, seems to be the most expensive on campus housing, and there\u2019s no furniture. \n\nDo I need to figure out an off campus living solution? If it helps, I\u2019m also a member of the Grand Challenges LLC. Usually there\u2019s a certain number of NAN apartments reserved for upperclass GLC members, but I\u2019m not sure if that only applies for undergrads. I might also look into applying to be an RA if that helps. \n\nI had looked into off campus housing earlier this academic year because I\u2019m tired of twin XLs and miss my dog. Ultimately, I had decided against it because I like being close to my classes and can\u2019t afford much. If unfurnished 10th &amp; home for $1357/month really is the only option on campus, please recommend off campus options (preferably near east campus). Would really love to hear from current graduate students. Thanks!",

But like everyone else has said, I have a furnished unit with my own bedroom (and a roommate with their own bedroom), shared bathroom, kitchen, decent sized living room, and laundry (washer &amp; dryer) between the 2 of us. The rent evens out to about as much as it was when I lived in NAV (I think maybe around $200-300 more per *semester* based on my bursar payments). It's really not too bad of a walk to the Klaus/CCB/Howey and its fairly easy to use the green bus route to go back and forth between the Student Center &amp; Transit Hub stops.",

Initially, they used flattery, saying things like \"You look like a nice person\" ( this happened to me twice )  and \"You seem like a smart guy,\" which I brushed off as typical sales tactics. However, the situation became more suspicious when they showed me a donation sheet with the minimum amount listed as $100. After expressing my inability to donate that much, the representative reluctantly reduced the amount first to $50, then to $30.\n\nWhat concerned me was the extensive personal information they requested at the payment stage, including scanning my card and needing my address, like I just want to pay and move on. I'm uncertain about how this data might be used. Furthermore, the representative had agreed to all the terms and conditions on my behalf during the signing process. I had to intervene to cancel and review the terms myself. This should have been my red flag to cancel it all and move on. \n\nThe most contradictory aspect came the next day when I saw one of the organization's members smoking on campus. It struck me as highly incongruous to witness someone involved in cancer research fundraising smoking, given the well-known health risks associated with it.\n\nSo yeah this was a learning experience for me. In the future, I'll be more careful and think twice before making spontaneous donations. It's a good reminder to do a little research first.",

I see everyone constantly hanging out together, going on vacations together, going to events and parties together, and rarely people doing things alone. I'm a 3rd year so I've been here for a while, but every year I always have to go for random roommates because I don't have any friends who could room with me. There are so many events on campus and in Atlanta that I've never gone to because I don't want to go alone for either safety reasons or because it would look odd to be the only person there alone. There are so many important fun events that I end up missing out on because I never knew they were happening and even when I want to go to them, I don't have people to go with. But social aspects aside, most of the time I don't even have people to check homework answers with or study for exams with. I honestly didn't realize just how many people here have so many friends that they're constantly doing things with, but I feel like I'm completely missing out on the college experience because this is pretty much the only time of my time that I'll get to be around so many people my own age. I always thought college would give me the freedom that I could never have at home but I rarely ever leave my room except to go to class, and it seems at this point that everyone already has their established friends and they don't necessarily want to make more. I'm not trying to place blame on anyone here because I know part of it is my fault too, I'm just posting this because I want to see if this is my unique experience at GT or if other people can relate to this.

People barely go and talk to someone they don\u2019t know and everyone is very invested in their own friend group. Especially sometimes I strike up a question and I\u2019m met with dead-end stares and no engagement or follow-up conversation. \n\nI have been proven wrong a few times when I\u2019m in that right position of wanting a friend and meeting someone who also wants a friend. But I do think it\u2019s a lot harder than people say and I wish there was a more welcoming culture especially for people who aren\u2019t first-years. \n\nAnother thing is that in high school etc it was easy to be friends because you spent the whole day together. Now that everyone has separate schedules and you only have to see a person for one class it feels really hard to make genuine connections. I look forward to a one-hour club meeting every week because it\u2019s the only time I\u2019m guaranteed to see my friends, for the rest of the week I feel completely alone. \n\nIf you need a friend, reach out, I\u2019m always looking!",

A lot of people do have established friend groups, but a lot of people will be happy to meet someone new. Not all of those interactions will lead to friendship, but if you meet enough people, you'll come across some that you really click with and will hopefully become friends with. I'm a 4th year and I'm still meeting people that I become close friends with, even if I don't necessarily join their existing friend groups. Point is, it's never too late! And it's fine if the people you get to know don't coalesce into one cohesive friend group. You might become friends with a lot of people all over the place who aren't necessarily friends with each other, and sometimes that's just how it is but other times you can be the bridge to bring them together. In any case, you got this dude/dudette!",

                "body": "I spent a lot of time in my room during my first 2 years of college. Most of that was due to covid, but also tbh it probably would've happened anyway. I had to go through some trial and error to find friend groups that I really stuck with. In my first semester back in 2019, I did marching band (which was kind of a continuation of HS), and it was a lot of fun, but I didn't really vibe with a lot of people there. Once second semester started, I was a little more desperate socially, and through a weird set of circumstances I ended up accepting a bid from a fraternity. I was able to make some new friends, but it still didn't work out entirely.\n\nLong story short, the only group I ended up sticking with throughout college was VGDev, which I had been a part of since 2019, but didn't really get involved socially with until 2021. It's provided me with lifelong friends and opportunities and a deep social network, so I haven't really had to look elsewhere since. Even within classes I sometimes meet people within the club and we can discuss homework and what not.\n\nIf you want to get out of your room and step outside your comfort zone a bit, **I'm sending my personal invitation** to come to CCB 017 at 4:45 today for the first VGDev meeting of the semester (don't worry if you're not a cs major; it's chill). If going to a gathering of people and not knowing anyone is too intimidating, I'll be there and you're welcome to talk to me. I usually wear a black leather jacket near the front and if you ask around about Logan you should be able to find me. Even if the club itself doesn't interest you, it might be cool to meet some new people. \n\nI've had very intense depressive episodes throughout college where I don't leave my room for several weeks or don't talk to anyone, so I understand being on that side of things. The personality makeup and general energy of this school makes socializing weird sometimes, but that's ok. Don't assume that people \"don't want to make more friends\", because sometimes the energy that people give off and what they really want are vastly different.",

I should rephrase to remove ambiguity as you or others may misunderstand.\n\nIt is not a strategy, guide, or path to getting friends. Rather, it is a necessary building block.\n\nIn other words; it does not mean that if you are a friend to others, then they will be a friend to you. They won't necessarily. It doesn't work that way.\n\nHowever, while we can not control others' actions, we can control our own actions. One side must initiate a friendship for it to form, so if you want one, control your own action and be the initiator. Then its up to them to follow through and, metaphorically, say \"hello\" back.\n\nBy analogy, relationships are often depicted as fishing, and you must put the hook in the water to catch a fish... However, that's a potentially misleading analogy. A better one is that of building a pyramid. One person lays a series of stones, and the other person, will have the option to choose to lay stones on top, etc... You can wait for others to take the first step, or you can do the first and hardest step yourself and wait for them to take an easier step.",

Then when it is time to go, ask for their number or instagram so you can contact them later. The vast majority of people here are super friendly. It can be scary but if you ask people if they want to hang out, they're often eager to! I'll typically ask people if they want to grab a bite to eat, study, or go to some on campus event.

Your problem is staying inside and not getting involved on campus. And if that seems like a huge commitment, just try stopping someone at the end of class and striking up a conversation. Maybe mention you\u2019d like to exchange numbers to talk about homework and go from there. While some people might be busy or shy, there\u2019s plenty of people who are open to becoming friends.",

                "body": "This is definitely a larger issue in the US/globally with loneliness. Hyperindividualism gets in the way of a lot of our social opportunities. The blame isn\u2019t all on you or \u201cthem.\u201d The death of our \u201cthird spaces\u201d is a big part of this too. \n\nThat being said, I think people forget that socializing is a skill and needs to be practiced. Any relationship takes work and that includes friendships. Sure, some conversations can facilitate a friendship, but without consistency you\u2019ll leave it at a surface level with that person/group. In college it can be hard to see people regularly because of schedules, but you have to put in the effort for your friends.\n\nI think that\u2019s why greek life is so popular at Georgia tech (and in general)\u2014 it takes a lot of the effort out of making plans with friends and flaking etc. the schedule of events is decided and most frat/srat people just participate in those events and boom they have a social grouping to be part of.\n\nWhile i am a pretty social person, i empathize with a lack of a group of friends to do stuff with. My time at tech was quite lonely until i really invested in a few of the people in my life. I made time to see them, do stuff with them and plan stuff with them. I understand the initial part of it sucks with making friends, but it will continue to suck if you let all the small social interactions fizzle out. \n\nEven just from a networking perspective, if you aren\u2019t making friends at Georgia tech, you are MASSIVELY missing out. Job opportunities after college come a lot easier when you know people and the people to know are your peers at GT.\nMaking friends after college doesn\u2019t get any easier\u2014 I\u2019d take advantage of GT as much as you can. \n\nMy advice to you is make the effort and get comfortable with rejection. Say hi to people and smile. Ask a classmate to grab lunch after class. Don\u2019t go back to your room in the middle of the day(I think this is one of the most important parts of having good mental health in college). Find something to do consistently so you\u2019ll be around the same people a lot. People will take your invites more seriously if you\u2019re a familiar face. \n\nThere will certainly be people who aren\u2019t receptive to it\u2014 that\u2019s on them! If you keep it up, i think you\u2019ll find people to do all the things you want to be doing. \n\nAlso, all the people who you say have a lot of friends\u2014 ask them if they feel lonely. They probably do. There\u2019s a piece of this that everyone feels, even though it might seem like they shouldn\u2019t be feeling that way. If they seem to have a lot of friends and still feel lonely, ask what they do when they feel lonely\u2014 they probably go and surround themselves with people.",

        "selftext": "I didn't think I would be making a post about this, but it needs to be addressed as this has happened a second time to me. Georgia Tech's staff working in the offices are rude. On October 2nd of 2023, I had to make the difficult decision to put down my dog after he suffered for three days. This was a Monday morning. The first thing I did that morning was go to the vet, and they told me that the dog couldn't be saved and that it was too late. \n\nI had an exam for MATH 2550 that afternoon. After I got back from the vet, I emailed my prof. about scheduling a makeup because I obviously wasn't in the right mental place to take an exam. He told me to talk to the dean of students, so I called the office at 9:47 in the morning. I explained to the woman on the phone exactly what had happened, and the only response I got from her was to \"fill out the request to meet a dean form\" from the dean of students. She also said to me over the phone that the dean of students didn't support the death of a pet. When I asked her where the form was, she was rude and didn't give me any direct answers, so I searched for it and found it myself. I filled out and submitted the form at 10:03 AM. This is exactly what I submitted:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ey9o3b6d9dc1.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5795477a187e54dcabc5d9b8152b5aeb39cddc4c\n\nMy exam was at 2 PM, and I had cried so hard that day that I had a headache and didn't feel okay driving. I commute from home. Since there had been no word from the Dean of Students office, my dad drove me to the exam, and I took it. \n\nAt 2:47 PM, I received an email from the woman I spoke to on the phone that morning, IW. This is the copy-and-paste email that she sent back to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d8mnfkl8d9dc1.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef4467826d93a032c5ae4ab09b3ae744fe37e6eb\n\nI think the best part about this letter is the sign-off on the next page: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tof63qj9d9dc1.png?width=196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=857a029f5e6a6714adbff7b92dddc68b38f70ced\n\nThis dog was a part of my family. I don't have a mom. It's just me and my dad. That dog WAS my fucking family. At what point does death matter to Gatech? At what point is a death considered a personal emergency? At what point does my grieving matter to this school? I was absolutely disgusted and horrified by this letter, and I realized at this point, that nobody in the dean of students office is going to take me seriously. So I decided to email the dean of students himself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q9t2muedd9dc1.png?width=996&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3713ff8f9baa15333383309ad5210c1a35e1f09\n\nThe dean of students responded (and seemed genuinely concerned about the issue) and we arranged to meet on Friday morning of the same week at 2 PM. At 10:56 AM on the 6th of October, Friday morning a few hours before my meeting with the dean, I receive another email from IW. This time, it's a class absence notification letter to all of my professors. What a coincidence! It's almost as if she realized she screwed up and went back on how heartless she had been toward me! \n\nI didn't meet with the dean because I decided it was not worth pursuing any further, but I deeply regret that decision. I never had, nor do I have the intention of getting IW fired, and that is not why I am writing this Reddit post. (But maybe she should get fired if she hates talking to students so much.) All I want is an apology for the insensitive way she treated me. However, after this past week, I've changed my mind based on how I've been treated YET AGAIN by Gatech staff. \n\nI noticed an issue with one of the classes I enrolled in during phase 2 registration last week. INTA 1200 was showing up as a fall-through class on my Degree Works. I enrolled in the class intending to take it as a free elective. I emailed my advisor, and she explained to me after add/drop ended for students on Friday evening that it only counts as a social science. She told me I could go to the registrar's office to see if they could drop the class on Tuesday when campus reopened. I called the registrar's office first at 1:55 PM. The phone rang around 2 times, then cut to voicemail. No worries, I'll just head there in person. At around 3 PM, I headed into the registrar's office to speak with the staff. I spoke to a woman who told me that my advisor had the ability to change what the class counts under in Degreeworks, which my advisor emailed me was not possible. \n\nWhen I spoke, this woman kept talking over me until at one point, I just kept talking while she cut me off and it was both of us talking for a full sentence. Her comments were snippy, and the way she talked to me felt like she was talking down to me. Finally, she just pointed to a stack of business cards and told me to email them my GTID and the CRN. I did so and specified in the email that I wanted the class dropped. They emailed back saying the class had been added. That's not what I wanted. I emailed back to remind them that I wanted the class dropped. They emailed back saying they dropped the class. Lo and behold, today I looked at my class schedule, and they, in fact, did not drop that class. Instead, they dropped another class, one that I need to graduate on time. \n\nWow! If you had read my original email, you could see that I included everything that you needed to drop the class from my schedule. I even double-checked to make sure I sent the correct CRN. The kicker is that I HIGHLIGHTED the CRN and my GTID in the original email. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/po0hcpl5e9dc1.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86d89260d133c9e3f08afe28b46179288044dac4\n\nThis afternoon, the 18th of January, I called the registrar's office yet again, and FINALLY someone answered. The woman I spoke to this time corrected my issue by deleting the class that I originally wanted to delete and adding the dropped class back to my schedule. I told her exactly what happened, and I didn't even get an apology for the way I was treated by her coworker. I thanked her and just hung up after she was done. As someone who worked at a company, if a customer or someone I was serving complained about terrible service, you apologize on behalf of the staff and company regardless of whether you made the mistake or not. \n\nI want to clarify that I was never rude to any of the staff starting these conversations because I was raised with manners, unlike the staff that I had the displeasure of speaking to. I never raised my voice, cussed, or did anything to cause them to act so rudely toward me.\n\nWhy is it that so many Georgia Tech staff have absolutely 0 manners and are disrespectful to students? If you hate your job, don't work here. You work in a receptionist position that involves speaking with young adults. We are NOT children for you to disrespect and talk down to. \n\nThis is not a one-department issue. This is a systematic issue on the way Georgia Tech handles their staff and lets their staff treat students. ",

Your argument isn't with me, it is with a large bureaucratic administration that is loathe to adjust its own schedules or deadlines at the request of a single individual with limited standing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want my honest appraisal on your situation, Georgia Tech has been shafting students with better standing than you, worse than they are you for longer than you've been alive.   I saw worse happen while I was there and probably many people on this sub have as well.   I wouldn't expect much.   You will undoubtedly run into individual people who are sympathetic with a desire to accommodate you but they are employees whose actions are subservient to whatever system management/regents/whomever have put into place.  \n\nI'm not familiar with the particulars of your situation but if I were in your place then I would operate on the hypothesis that making the administrator's decision to grant whatever allowance you need as easy as possible is the way to go.   This would involve as much documented notice, communication and negotiation with you and your professor as possible before getting the administration involved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith most of my professors, the level of instruction they provided to their undergrads as a whole was a secondary or tertiary concern.   They aren't robots, but I think its wishful thinking to expect them to meet you halfway when it comes to your classwork and schedule.   If you have made the decision (justifiably or not) to not make your final your top priority then I don't know why you would expect anyone else to.    These people aren't your family and they usually aren't your friends.   The expectation is that you find a way to manage your own affairs per your own will.    From what I have personally seen, Tech is much more forgiving and helpful to students who demonstrate a lack of resources than a conscientious decision that will adversely affect their academic efforts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not know what else that will make the perspective of the people you are dealing with any clearer.",

And we still have a German Shepherd that I absolutely adore; if something happens to her, I will be beyond upset. So I get the pain of losing a pet. But this is where I have to give a little bit of hard life reality. It's still a pet. No matter how much we love them, even though, yes, they are part of our family, and how much losing them hurts, they are a pet.\n\nLater in life, past college and once in the work world if something like this happens (and when I say \"like this\" I am not referring to the death of a close family member, but a pet). you may have to be strong and head to work and face life. Most companies are not going to give you bereavement pay for a pet. You may have an important meeting or project deadline that can't be set aside for a pet so you may not be able to even take a vacation day to grieve. If I'm a professor, I would be hard pressed to make an excused absence for a test for a pet. I would hope you could see how that is ripe for abuse. I even had a prof in grad school at State that was not going to let me make up a missed exam - he was going to count my final double - for missing it to go to my sister's wedding (I couldn't take that risk and skipped the wedding, which was ok by me as I don't like weddings anyway! :) ) \n\nI know it is hard, but part of life is learning to deal with those difficult events with a stiff upper lip and getting on with things. A friend who manages an entire department at his business had to deny a staff member's request to stay home while a dog that was merely sick because he could not have that shift covered on short notice (it was the kind of job that didn't have work that could just be set aside until the next day).\n\nI truly hope you are doing better and that you come out of this stronger. There is no doubt in the world that love for dogs is real and intense. But, while I am sure many will attack me for this bit of \"tough love,\" it's a point of reality for life and life after school. Oh, and while I did not read all the details of the Hill, it's always been a challenge with Tech students to deal with. At least there are still commonalities in the Tech experience even today!",

                "body": "1. Challenging - OMSCS is able to admit more students due to less seating constraints. Some students that do not gain initial entry to the MSCS Program can seek entry with the OMSCS Program and potentially transfer after 1-2 semesters of completing CS coursework.\n\n2. Best to hear from a student - but in my opinion....better research opportunities/experience as you can work alongside other students and professors in-person. Attend campus events, career fairs, access campus resources, etc. MSCS is a full-time program while OMSCS is a part-time program, so students can graduate quicker and pursue their career. The MSCS Program has 11 specializations to choose from while OMSCS only has five. But there are of course some advantages to being purely online...better chances of getting into a class you want since there are more seats, easier to juggle online courses and work compared to having to go to classes at a certain day/time...the OMSCS Program admits for both Fall/Spring semesters while MSCS is Fall only....pros and cons for each. But I'm biased for on-campus.\n\n3. Again, best to hear from a student for this one...but from a staff perspective we have our general GT Career Center, and College of Computing has its own Career Services. Each entity has its own Career Fairs students may attend to connect with potential employers. Each entity offers professional development assistance like resume reviews, interview tips/practice...We have Assistantship opportunities (GTA/GRA) that offer great experience working with/under professors and the student can receive tuition waivers for participating. Our Graduate Internship Program is nice and often leads to future full-time positions after graduation. There's probably more to touch on with this, so hopefully some students share insights. \n\n4. If you mean recruiters for potential employers, yes. Many will visit throughout the semester and set up inside the College of Computing building to speak with students that may be interested in connecting and learning more. Beyond that we have the career fairs and other things I mentioned above. \n\nHopefully that helps, but I'll be interested to see what other students share as well.",

Graduating in December would mean I could potentially get another internship. The problem is that I\u2019ve been struggling to get one. I have sent out hundreds of applications and done several interviews. I\u2019ve made it to final rounds at I think 5 or 6 companies, but two of them ended up cancelling their programs and I was unfortunately not chosen for the others. I\u2019ve been continuing to apply, but there\u2019s hasn\u2019t been anything I\u2019ve been super excited about. My main concern is that if I graduate in the summer, I will run into the same issue with full time jobs which is obviously a much bigger problem. I really don\u2019t want to go to grad school.\n\nSome important things to know is that I already have 3 internships on my resume. Also, I have my lease through the summer, so I\u2019d have a place to stay for the summer courses, whereas I\u2019d probably be commuting for the fall.\n\nWhat would you do?",

I sort of messed up in terms of housing so I\u2019m with a bunch of roommates who know each other way more than I do, and honestly\u2026it feels like that no matter where I go, whether it\u2019s meeting my friends in class or clubs or just on online groups. I feel like I\u2019m not a main priority anywhere, even when it comes to friends I find in different places who happen to know each other \ud83d\udc80. \n\nI guess it sort of just happened. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I\u2019m out-of-state so it\u2019s harder to be comfortable with new people (and I still haven\u2019t found a group of people here I feel \u201cright\u201d with), or I didn\u2019t plan things properly by doing more clubs, or if I\u2019m just under an illusion that I\u2019m more lonely than I am because I\u2019m not keeping myself busy doing things.\n\nI just wonder if someone else is in the same boat. A lot of my friends seem unresponsive to my texts asking to hang out so I also wonder, is it common for people to just be extremely busy?\n\nAlso, thanks for taking the time to read this :) I would also be down to chat with anyone on campus who feels the same way or would be interested to do so.",

I\u2019d definitely suggest picking a hobby (like crc, wall climbing, GT bike club etc) and joining some club you\u2019re interested in.

The reality is that another more people experience this than you think. The transition from high-school/ home is very different because you aren't with the same set of people for an extended period of time. It's harder to form closer relationships unlike you really hit it off from the get go. Lost of people you see may also come from the same high-school or might have done some sort of first year program. Then to add to that classes, unadorned schedules, jobs, school work it gets pretty difficult ibr. Considering I came from boarding school it was a very big shock for me but I guess finding a club or group of people you feel comfortable with and feel like are being real with you if gets better from there. I found that comfort in church on campus. I hope you find something similar aswell, be open to trying different things I guess and don't beat yourself up too mich about it. Love ya",

                "body": "I get the feeling. I'm a third year at this point, and I was lucky to find most of my friends the first week I was on-campus. That said, I don't think I've made a single lasting friend through any of my classes because I've always felt like they already had their own established friends. This is part of my own problem, but you have to not worry about that as much when you're at least starting. They might have a \"core\" friend group, but I feel like most people here like to have extended networks of people.\n\nMy best advice for making actual lasting friends is kinda the same as everyone else is saying too. Not sure what your classes are like, but small group classes are definitely a place for making good connections. I have a language minor, and that allowed me to kinda trauma-bond with the rest of my class, who I still talk to now even after finishing my reqs. And if you're looking for clubs, one that I haven't seen anyone else recommend so far is Alternative Service Break! I applied for it at one of my lowest mental points (in part, because of my social lacking), and it really did a world of a difference for me. If you have the money to spare (and it's still running), I 100% recommend.\n\nMore than anything though, please remember that gt can feel especially isolating to everyone, so it's not just you. I think we have a lot of great people here, but the foundational campus culture still has a lot of inherent negativity that can get to everyone. I hope you find your way out of this slump though :)",

IE has a concentration in Operations Research and also a concentration in Advanced Studies in Operations Research and Statistics, while business has a concentration in Operations and Supply Chain Management. i dont think they have a BS in just OR though. since both have OR concentrations, which major would u recommend? thanks!",

For about a week my balance in the bursar was negative, I was expecting to get money back this semester as it showed Zell and REACH aid were applied, but yesterday it turned positive and now I\u2019m being charged a lot more than a normal full time class semester. I emailed the GT financial aid office and they said audit hours don\u2019t count for financial aid. I told them my co-op situation and they then old me to tell my advisor that I am \u201cneeding billable credit hours so I can receive financial aid.\u201d Is it possible to change audit hours to billable credit hours for a co-op or am I screwed for every semester I co-op?",

You can choose what you want to work on whether it be hardware, software, or mechanical design (idk if that's what it's called - I'm a CS major lol). Also, you don't need to work on whatever is related to your major. I've seen CS majors work on CAD to build those skills (they provide training so don't worry about that). For competition you get to go somewhere cool (one of the teams is going to the Netherlands). You can't tell me that robots fighting each other is not so cool!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've found making friends organically to be pretty hard, but when you join clubs you spend more time with the same people which can eventually lead to friendships outside the club. I don't go to parties or anything like that (just not my thing), but I found that scheduling things on the weekend (like hiking, going out to eat, etc.) with people can help build friendships. Just ask, the worst they can say is no! Good luck and have fun!",

The admission process is divided in two steps. The first step is a check of general requirments (english, degree etc.), and there is not a GPA requirment (at least for aerospace). So, if I have all the general requirments, am I automatically included for the second admission step?\n2. The second step is based on GPA. Is the GPA evaluated by a general commission or by your potential professor?\n3. What happens in the second step if you already worked with, so you have a strong recomandation by a GT professor?\n4. If I have a Master degree, is it a strenght point or is it not useful?\n5. Someone in this group have applied for the PhD program for Fall 2024 (if yes, you can contact me and we can stay in touch)\n\nThank you!",

I have spoken with my advisor and they said they put me in the waitlist priority request document for graduating seniors but I haven't noticed any difference. I am still 200th on one of the waitlists for the classes I need. I have gone in person to the registrar and they turned me away and said they can't do anything and I have to have the course department move me or get some permit. They were super vague and it seemed like they didn't really know what they were talking about, but they said there was nothing they could do (and were super indifferent to my problem, like, I'm trying to graduate and I'm struggling here, at least show a little sympathy??). I went in person to see my advisor and they weren't even in person today. The guy at the front desk told me only my advisor can do anything about my registration stuff.\n\nI feel like I'm in a circular loop. What can I do to get the courses I need to graduate? Or am I just screwed and I have to just hope that tomorrow a spot opens up and I can snipe it?",

There are a lot of people at GT (and in the world) who would love to do something to fix a problem, but can't. Those cant's can be anything from they aren't allowed to to its not physically possible to do. Pretty much every room, staff office, and every faculty member at Tech is truly running at the limit of what they can do. They care immensely - and that care is exhausting if you don't put boundaries on it - they just can't make classrooms bigger.\n\nI know it sometimes seems like it should be easy to open up more seats, hell you might not care if you sit on the floor. But everyone answers to someone about that decision - and before you think I mean President Cabrera, I actually mean the fire marshal.\n\nI would add the constant refrain from GT students that X, Y, or Z office or person *doesn't care* is often really hurtful to those people because they do care, they do wish they could do something, and they can't. Hearing that over and over again costs us good people and demoralizes those who stay. When advisors have 100s of students (they shouldn't), who are all having registration problems (they shouldn't), and there isn't anything they can do besides advocate upwards (which they do) to get told that they don't care all the time would drive me to drinking.\n\nI get the frustration - truly because I've been there - but there are more constructive approaches. That they don't fix it is not even close to evidence they don't care - and saying it is has real negative impacts.",

I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a reason to rush college unless it\u2019s a money concern or something. you just get less time for internships and less time to be a student, explore clubs, research, party, whatever you want to do.",

Classes you can generally skip if necessary; you can load up all the work for one furious evening. PhD advisors (and I had an awesome, understanding one) want you around for prompt idea exchange, helping out other people in the lab, etc. You're effectively their fulltime employee; that's what they'll be expecting in any case.\n\nIf you have a full or part-time job outside the PhD, you may feel that you are between two worlds, without belonging to either one. Neither the university nor the workplace is well adapted to dealing with the other, and each may place demands that are incompatible with those of the other. Your biggest problems may be the double commute, scheduling difficulties, and isolation.\n\nThe good thing is that there's almost no conceivable career path that requires concurrent intense industry work and acquisition of a PhD. If you're thinking about jobs that require a pro forma PhD, get one at GSU. If you want to go academic, save up some cash and do your PhD properly. If you want industry, the time you'd spend on a PhD can be much more profitably applied to industrial work.\n\nNo hiring manager prefers \"PhD\" over \"Generated XXX million dollars of revenue\" except an academic one.",

If you would like to discuss it being fixed faster I recommended finding the project manager for the construction project and consulting them. Odds are that\u2019s a waste of time because they have a fixed budget and fixed schedule. If you want a faster timeline or higher budget you\u2019d need to get the state legislature to pass a bill to implement that.\n\nBasically all that to say welcome to construction.

If you provide ample evidence backing your claim of not having broken OSI rules, then you should have won, right? Plus, for some reason this sounds really close to defamation (they claim you are academically dishonest and lack integrity, which you have proof of the contrary) and could jeopardize your future, even if you didn't actually break a law.\n\nAlso, do they allow you to see or hear the reasoning behind their verdict? Who made the verdict, anyway? Do you know if they were completely impartial? Do you have any reason to suspect that this professor might have it out for you? That last one sounds a bit outlandish, especially for this school, but in a scenario like this one, you can't afford to rule anything out without conclusive evidence of the contrary.\n\nLike I said, I've never gone through this before, so my instinct is to look at it through a legal lens, especially if you had to provide evidence of your own innocence and how this might affect your ability to succeed later in life.\n\nBest of luck to you. OSI is no joke, but dont let them kill your future. If you really are innocent, I hope you make it through this.",

        "selftext": "First off, I want to thank the r/GaTech mod team for allowing this post! With all the hype our team has gotten over this last season after finally ditching G**** and getting our first bowl win since 2016 I wanted to give y'all a way to keep the hype going into the Offseason. I joined this league back in March of last year and have really enjoyed it. Though there are some uGA fans in the league so it would be nice to have a few more GT people to help balance it out.\n\nThe 45th season of the International Simulation Football League is wrapping up, which means that it is a great time to create a player and join! The ISFL is a free online sim league where you create a professional football player and control their journey through the pros from pre-draft to retirement. With over 30 player archetypes to choose from, you can be anything from a pass-catching running back to a ball hawking safety or even a strong legged kicker. \n\nYour player will compete in games (simulated using Draft Day Sports: Pro Football 2021) throughout the week that premiere on [our YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@ISFL) nightly. Each 16-game season lasts about 6 weeks, including playoffs, followed by a 2 week offseason. Complete stats are recorded on the [league index](https://index.sim-football.com/ISFLS45/), and we also have cool user-made tools to keep track of [historical records](https://isfl-bot.herokuapp.com/) and [our very own Hall of Fame](https://wiki.sim-football.com/view/List_of_ISFL_Hall_of_Fame_inductees).\n\nWith hundreds of players and over 20 teams across the developmental and major leagues, the ISFL is also an active online community. Joining a team is not only a chance to see your player succeed, but also to hang out with fellow users in the Discord server that serves as your team\u2019s locker room. You\u2019ll be joining a tight-knit group of like-minded people who enjoy getting a bit nerdy about football and root together for your players when they take the simulated field.\n\n## Sounds Great! How Do I Start?\n\nIf you want to jump in right away, a great place to start is to join the [ISFL Rookie Discord](https://discord.gg/mPHkNKcWdH). Our team of rookie mentors will be happy to answer any questions and assist you with creating your player and getting started on your ISFL career! If you want to read more about the process first, we have a great [Rookie Guide](https://forums.sim-football.com/showthread.php?tid=6235) written up on the league forums and a [series of tutorial videos on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCr9BsbjaE3qnGZ9ZX54rVZIRWtu5bHbi&amp;si=aIVhYe_w70l3IdWj) as well to walk you through the player creation process.\n\n## What Happens After I Create My Player?\n\nAfter making your player, you'll be scouted by teams that are entirely run by other users in the league and drafted to a developmental team in the DSFL Draft on Thursday, January 25. Just like the games, the YouTube channel streams all our offseason events including drafts, awards shows, and the Prospect Bowl that your new player will compete in!\n\nDuring your player\u2019s career, you can improve their attributes by spending 10-15 minutes completing optional tasks each week, like predicting the winners of each game or mocking the 1st round of the draft. The league is 100% free - there is no \"pay to win\" and nothing costs real money to unlock. You will earn fake league currency through your player's contracts or through creating content like written articles, graphics, or podcasts. You can use it to further upgrade your player and do fun things like collecting trading cards of ISFL players!\n\n## Quick Links\n\nThanks for reading! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments of this post, in the Rookie Discord, or on our subreddit, r/SimulationFootball\n\nRookie Discord: https://discord.gg/mPHkNKcWdH   \nRookie Guide: https://forums.sim-football.com/showthread.php?tid=6235   \nCreate-a-Player Tool: https://forums.sim-football.com/form.php?formid=1",

Would have made getting into the Master's program a breeze.\n\nProbably should have done more extracurriculars than just music, which I'd already been doing since grade school. I had many opportunities that were actually put right in front of me, but I didn't take them.\n\nIf I had gotten the mental help I needed years ago so that I wasn't so busy keeping my head above water academically, I'd have been able to do said extracurricular activities as well as internships and co-ops, maybe even graduated earlier or done BSMS.\n\nBut what's done is done. There's no changing what's already happened. If you have regrets, then the best you can do is either move on, or find a way to get what you've always wanted before it's really too late. Plus, you never know if the things you weren't able to achieve are what closes certain doors so that you can adapt and find a new path.\n\nJust because I got out doesn't mean getting help won't help me to get a job. And there's such a thing as hobbies outside of having a career. I've heard that those special interests showing up on a resume can help your chances of getting a position.\n\nIn that same conversation about minoring in ID, I also found that a Master's in ID isn't barred from people who didn't get the minor; it just takes longer to get (3 years, which, for me, is a *blessing* compared to how long it took to get out the first time around). And I likely wouldn't have even considered it so seriously if it weren't for my academic struggles keeping me from just getting an MS in my original BS field of study.\n\nDon't let your regrets eat at you, folks. Just find a way to move forward. You might have another chance waiting just down the road.",

By adding ID as a curriculum, you will essentially be learning how to make products that not only function properly and safely but also look appealing to the eye with an ergonomic nature. I'd say that's a great way to round out your skills and make you look more competitive in the job market.\n\nTaking on extracurriculars and Hobbies can also help round out your skills. Not everything you do has to be engineering all the time. As I said previously, I graduated as a mechanical engineer, but I was a musician for *much* longer. They are two very different fields that have given me a diverse skillset and mindset that spans both STEM and the arts. If anything, this is why I might go back for an ID masters: to make useful things that actually look cool and easy to interact with.\n\nAs for academic habits, if you think you have any mental health issue that may be at play (neurodivergence like ADHD/ASD, dyslexia, etc.), get professionally tested so that the Office of Disabilities Services can help you. I didn't seek help until my last semester, and if I had, I likely would have graduated with honors.\n\nOtherwise, work with your teachers, and build a positive rapport with them by going to office hours and talking with them about anything you don't get. If you can't make it to meetings, then post on Piazza. Take charge and start the group chats; that's where you can ask questions unfiltered, and you never know who else is fighting the same question. Plus at some point people start posting memes to alleviate the stress.\n\nBest of luck!",

When I started working in big tech as a junior engineer, I knew many people at my level who didn't contribute any meaningful value to the company but were still brought on (I think) because tech companies wanted the appearance of growth.\n\nNow the tide is rolling out and companies are trying to be lean and efficient, which means hiring mostly senior engineers who come in and can immediately create value.  The advancement of generative AI has also removed a lot of grunt work that used to be given to junior engineers, which is why I think it will stay like this.",

There were several students (mostly CS) at Tech who got severance packages from companies before ever starting work because their job offers were rescinded due to economic conditions.\n\nThen the 9/11 attacks happened.  I was actually getting dressed to go to a GT job fair that morning but never made it (they ended the job fair early due to the attack).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months later I did an informal poll of people I knew who graduated ChemE my year and roughly 1/3 of us were working chemE jobs.  Another 25-30% of us were hiding in grad school and the rest of us were either unemployed, underemployed, or working non-ChemE type jobs.   Almost all  of the ChemE's who were gainfully employed moved across the country for their jobs.\n\nI worked for 4 years at a gym and doing odd gig type work until I got a sales job with a manufacturer which I eventually transitioned to engineering.    Part of the reason it took me so long is because I was dead set against leaving Atlanta.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven so, the environment was bad.  I was friends with  a CS grad who did clerical type work in an office for a couple of years until she was able to find a programming job.   CS came roaring back about half a decade later, but ChemE has never quite recovered.    When I started at Tech ChemE had the highest average starting salary out of all the engineering majors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I think that CS has a different issue... the jobs are widely recognized as having a high pay ceiling for a relatively small amount of training and middling difficulty-of-curriculum.    CS grads/students are everywhere.... whereas ChemE never had the same issue of lots of people flocking to the discipline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea what will happen moving forward... the barrier to entry in CS (getting your first job) is already pretty high.   You'd think that would suppress wages but Tech companies are the main ones that are flush with cash... they can easily afford to keep paying high salaries.       I wonder if it will work out like the legal industry where you have a massive disparity between the higher and lower earners.  Dunno.  Good luck to you all.",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone! I did my undergrad at Tech, and I was a TA for CS 2110 for two years. Around February of last year, Dr. Conte had the idea of writing a toolchain for the LC-3, hoping to make the connection between C and Assembly more obvious. I took him up on the offer, and I worked on it last Spring and Summer. Since we ultimately decided not to incorporate it into the course, we made the toolchain open source: [https://github.com/lc-3-2](https://github.com/lc-3-2). It includes the compiler, a simulator, and a rudimentary C library. The compiler is fairly powerful - it successfully compiles the C library, as well as the `coremark` benchmarks.\n\n*Note that this is for the LC-3.2 architecture, not the LC-3.* The LC-3.2 is based off the LC-3b ([https://users.ece.utexas.edu/\\~patt/19s.460n/handouts/appA.pdf](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~patt/19s.460n/handouts/appA.pdf)), which is itself a byte-addressable variant of the LC-3. The LC-3.2 was extended to have a 32-bit word size (hence the name), and it provides instructions to load/store words along with the already existing load/store instructions for 16-bit halfwords and for bytes. As such, *the LC-3.2 is not binary compatible nor assembly compatible with the LC-3*, so don't complain to me when you can't use the compiler to cheese the assembly assignments.\n\nIf you're the kind of person to do so, I have a few ideas for extensions:\n\n* In theory, it should be possible to compile any language using LLVM to the LC-3.2. Maybe you can get Rust or Zig running?\n* The C Library is not complete. It does not deal with files, for example. Maybe you can add that functionality?\n* The compiler doesn't use `R4` as a global pointer. Maybe you can get it to do that?\n* Using what I have, it might be possible to make a compiler for the LC-3b. The main difference is that words are 16-bit, but LLVM can handle that. Getting a compiler for the LC-3 might be harder since LLVM assumes `i8` exists, but what do I know.",

I see some issues with areas appearing to overlap (room 240 is closed for renovation lol, so that may be picking up from the nearby office spaces &amp; 5th floor track is deeeefinitely picking up from the 4th floor courts), but the concept if neat. \n\nIf this new system works relatively accurately with further calibration (?, idk if that possible upon request of the CRC to the company), that's a huge win!!

I know that Canvas may have inaccuracies, but given my major and the professor, the former is highly unlikely. I contacted my advisor who suggested I contact the professor of the class to see if they might be able to submit a grade change on their end but he was concerned it may not be enough given it's been almost a year since the original posting. What are my options? Has anyone dealt with this before? The advisor didn't seem too confident about the next steps. I have never needed to check degree works as all my design course grades were accurate on Canvas. \n\nTLDR: Degree Works has the wrong final grade but I only noticed after a year. Has anyone dealt with this before?",

If you aren't aware, we have a [live occupancy tracker](https://live.waitz.io/4vxie66a29ct) available. It's not 100% accurate, but it's a great baseline.\n\nBe sure to check out our Free Week for our Group Fitness program.\n\nIf it's really busy when you're here, check out the 4th floor. We have opened up some of the fitness studios for y'all. There is limited equipment in the rooms, but it's plenty functional. \n\nFinally, intramural sports registration is live. sign up early to ensure you get the timeslot that works best for you and your teammates.\n\nI am always happy to answer questions about campus recreation, its programs, facilities, and services!

Both these majors offer that, and I also want to also pursue an mba in the future, and maybe work in like a decision science type of role. \n\nCould you all provide any insight on the majors and what type of student would be suited to each one?",

From what I know, doing that concentration usually means you'd get a better grasp of Python and statistics. ITM with a certificate in business analytics is also a good option if you still want to be in the business school. I know both IE and ITM students who have done tech consulting and usually consulting firms do recruit ITM students specifically for tech consulting if that's what you're interested in. I know a lot of ITM students who also go on to do the GT master's in analytics program to go deeper in analytics and that degree is more technical.",

At any point, I feel like there are easily less than 50% the courses needed for any track being offered to students. This makes sense - it is a massive course list. But, all the while, new classes with ambiguous topics keep popping up; it's a bit confusing.\n\nSomething as simple as dynamically updating the MSCS requirements website with the current semester's offerings would make registration MUCH more tolerable. It would also temper everyone's expectations. And then they could maintain the complete list in a separate section of the page.\n\nOf course, the other long-term solution is to try and offer more classes, but that comes with universal problems that every CS department is dealing with, and GT has been hiring a lot of faculty recently.",

I went again around 12PM to inquire about the appropriate time to pick up the package from a staff member. The staff member informed me that if I came around 4:30 PM, all the packages would be sorted and available for pickup.\n\nAt 4:30 PM, during a conversation with the same staff member, The GLC OFFICE MANAGER abruptly intervened, stating that if I hadn't received an email confirmation, they couldn't assist in confirming the package. When I attempted to explain the urgency of the situation, the MANAGER cut my words and without listening to me, she even shouted at me, refusing to let me speak. Despite following the guidelines, the manager's dismissive behavior made me feel like it was not her concern. She even gestured for me to stay away from the mailroom, seeming to be using her authority in a way that felt like she was ignoring someone in need of an explanation.\n\nI had no choice but to leave, as the MANAGER continuously interrupted me without listening. Upon returning with my husband, the MANAGER's attitude changed drastically, engaging in a conversation with him without shouting or interrupting. However, when discussing the situation for almost 10 minutes, she did not genuinely apologize, merely mentioning that if she unintentionally caused embarrassment, she would apologize, but it did not seem sincere.\n\nI still believe I asked a legitimate question to the staff, and the manager's treatment, especially towards an individual with limited language proficiency, raises concerns about even discrimination, including gender and racial bias. I hope my concerns can be appropriately conveyed to her for resolution.",

        "selftext": " \n\nHello everyone  \nI'm applying for a PhD in engineering at GT and I need help to understand the process.\n\nActually, I've applied last year as well, and what happened is my application got accepted but the advisor told me to look for a professor to be my supervisor before I can be admitted to the program. To be honest, there was a virtual meeting with the department professors but, unfortunately, I did not manage to attend. Anyway, I already was interested in the work of some professors, so I got in touch and I managed to get into a couple of interviews. After that, things was going good with one professor but he told me he is waiting on funding approval before he can bring me in. Eventually, he told me that the fund was not approved and there is nothing more to do.\n\nIt was a bummer and left me in a bad place because in other universities if you get accepted then it's all done; you join the school and start studying some fundamentals and during your first semester you start looking for a supervisor.\n\nWhat I want to know is how the process of acceptance actually is at GTECH?\n\nLike, If I have to contact professors myself, then what is the benefit of having an application and paying application fees!\n\nThanks",

                "body": "This is why I strongly encourage anyone interested in an ME or AE PhD to **only** attend GT if they have funding and an advisor coming in. Not only are ME and AE students paid 2/3 the stipend of CS/ECE/IC students, but they hide the fact that students are on the hook for tuition if they can't get funding on their own (which is very challenging to do). Coupled with also needing to figure out their own advisor situation, it's a nightmare for students that most other departments and virtually all other universities have solved for decades.\n\nWhat results is the ME and AE departments over-admit PhD students who commit to GT because they've been accepted to a top program (and GT ME tells them \"funding will be determined at a later date\"), only to later hit them with \"you need to pay $16,000/semester because you don't have an advisor yet\", while **also** giving no support for getting an advisor. ECE does not assign advisors at the start, however they guarantee a TA-ship to cover tuition. ME tosses the full financial cost onto the student and has very, very few TA slots that are intentionally reserved for senior students.\n\nMany ME PhD students drop out, switch over to a masters after not being able to find an advisor, join toxic labs just because they need funding, or end up TAing their entire PhD (and borrowing from family to cover basic living expenses). It promotes a culture across many ME labs where advisors abuse the power differential to force students into vulnerable positions.\n\nCommonly, ME PhD students are strung along meaningless projects for years that don't advance their research nor end in publications, or their advisors take full credit for the students work, and students have no recourse as they are dependent on their advisor to stay out of serious financial debt. The ME department's ombudsman program is slow, inefficient, and has virtually no resources to financially support students in dire situations.\n\nIt's purely exploitative and is shameful to GT's reputation. I sincerely hope the faculty reading this call attention to these issues. Personally, I think you dodged a bullet by your potential advisor pulling out \u2014 I know other students in similar situations whose advisors instead just moved the goal posts a semester or two and had the student pay the ($16k/sem) tuition themselves while they figured out funding.\n\nGo elsewhere and avoid GT, the name on your resume is not worth it.",

He reached out to me recently saying that he's going to \"speak\" with the graduate chair. I just don't want to be excited for something which is seems close to impossible.\n\nI assumed TA's are finalized long before the end of the previous semester. However, with how the Professor spoke with me - it seems like he is unaware of any TA being assigned to his class.\n\n\nShould I keep any hope? As an international student getting the TAship would save me from a lot of debt.\n\nEdit: as more background, our department gave a form to fill out regarding this long before the end of the semester. I didn't get any offer at that time. I got a generic reply saying \"I will keep your application open until the next semester if any opportunities open up\"",

        "selftext": "This is gonna be half genuine question, half self-reassurance. I\u2019m a second year who had the honor of doing an Amazon internship the summer after my first year due to the AFE program. I applied this year to Meta University for their second year program, just to be able to tell myself I applied somewhere (not really expecting much + Amazon gave me a RO). Instead, not only did they contact me back, they bumped me up to regular SDE internship application instead of MU. This put into perspective just how unprepared I was - I never did LeetCode except for maybe two questions, I had my DS/Algo class literally last semester, and overall feel unconfident. \n\nNow, I am procrastinating doing the OA due on Thursday cause I already know I am not passing it, but I just am now thinking about how foreign it all looks to me. Just looking at some of the LC prep questions was making my head spin. I know it comes with LC practice, which I am gonna start this semester, but now I am curious how y'all who are fulltime SDEs find your understanding of CS compared to your jobs? \n\nI am asking this in terms of both understanding + prep for interviews as well as what you do in your day to day job. When I was working at Amazon, I understood most of it, but some of it I just had to ask for assistance on. I feel like the reason they even gave me a RO was because AFE's almost always get returns unless you really couldn't do anything for your project. On top of this, im doing people + media because I genuinely like these threads, but now I am worried that I should switch into another thread because my knowledge after graduating won't be adequate enough.\n\nIdk.... I guess what I want to know is how y'all feel now that you are full-time working. Was the degree enough of a foundation to feel comfortable doing SDE work? Did you do practice on the side, and if so, what and where? Any tips to help someone prep for both the SDE job and interviews?",

I did 4 internships, 2 of which were with a M(F)AANG, and only one of those internships did I actually USE those LeetCode/CS3510/CS1332 DSA skills I had learned.\n\nTl;Dr: study data structures and algorithms to get the job or to move jobs. \n\nOther than that, build your resume with hard and/or unique projects, and be deeply involved in them.\n\nThis also means continuing to study LeetCode/HackerRank every so often to brush up on your skills should you need to move or find another job for whatever reason.",

Transitioning from BSCS to the professional world could be rough if you're expecting it to be the same. I learned more about what I would be doing in the professional world from the 3 months I spent as an Amazon SDE intern than I did in coursework at Tech.\n\nNo real way around LC-like assessments other than to grind IMO. University hiring bars are a little easier than experienced roles, but I made sure I could reliably solve LC easy/mediums and mostly solve LC hard when I last searched for a new role. Daily, intentional practice helps a lot. I found tracking my progress via correctness, timeliness, and difficulty helped me stay motivated as I could see my trajectory trend up. Writing brief, 3 - 5 sentence summaries explaining why I chose (or should have chosen \ud83d\ude09) the right data structure (HashSet vs Trie vs plain ol' Array, etc.) or right approach (Divide and Conquer, 2 pointer, etc.) was useful as well since I found recognizing which tool to use or how to adapt them to new problems tricky at first.\n\nFor practice on the side-if you can find any large project through clubs or orgs or research to contribute to it would give you something to talk about in interviews. The closest I came to what working in the industry was like was when I contributed, reviewed, and collaborated with others on these larger projects. My experience has been that for the most part, its always better to implement simple solutions than complex ones and figuring that out is almost always a result of teamwork.\n\nAs for threads, I wouldn't change them unless you're targeting specific roles or companies that would be better described by other combinations (i.e. Intelligence for AI or Devices for embedded). In general, university hires or SWE 1 equivalents are expected to need significant help/direction and threads at Tech don't really alleviate this. Curricula are impossible to keep up to date with the pace of new tech and tests/homework usually don't expect anything more than correctness from your solutions. Expect to ask a lot of questions about tech stacks and design approaches-teams appropriate for junior engineers should know that you'll need these answers.\n\nYou're likely to encounter much more obtuse problems in school/leetcode than in your industry work. Better implementations of the tricky stuff already exist, and your teams will appreciate simple solutions over complex ones. The hard part is building useful, maintainable, and extensible software on time and as a team using a given toolset.\n\nTL;DR: Focus on large project, collaborative work if you can. Grind leetcode since too many roles still use those sorts of screens. Don't change threads because you think they'll better prepare you for industry. FAANG on your resume opens doors-you're ahead of the game if you're a second year with an internship. Good luck!",

Personally I find LeetCode interviews to be absolutely ridiculous and a terrible way to judge a candidate's actual ability, but that's a topic for another time. Keep in mind that there are PLENTY of companies out there that do actual job interviews, and while they may not pay crazy SV money, they also tend to be in lower COL areas where the money goes a lot farther, and you'll still be making more by yourself at 22 than most middle-aged families.\n\nAsking coworkers for help is a very good thing to do in general. Nobody expects you to know everything, especially straight out of college, and knowing when &amp; how to ask seniors for help is one of the most important soft skills for succeeding at the start of your career. The degree gets you to a baseline level of knowledge, but everything beyond that is learned on the job, largely through the help and mentorship of your senior engineers. I thought I was fairly decent at C++ when I started my job, but now after 5 years of working with modern C++ every day, I realize I knew absolutely NOTHING back then. \n\nRemember that your CS degree is teaching you a lot of the theory behind programming, but very little in the way of practical skills. In the real world, the practical skills are much more important. You can't learn how to add a feature to a project that's been going on for 10+ years in one semester. Nobody reading a resume is going to care about what classes you've taken, but being an active, contributing member to an extracurricular project can make you stand out because those tend to be a bit closer to working at a company.",

I am researching on transferring to Georgia Tech for my second year.  Ultimately, I want to puruse a Ph.D. in Pure Mathematics post undergraduate years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I am looking into Georgia Tech's Mathematics Requirements and Pure Mathematics Requirements, I noticed that they tend to be more focused on Applied Mathematics and the junction between CS and Math.  Some courses which interested me and satisfied the Pure Math Concentration/Math requirements include Math 4108 Abstract Algebra II, Math 4318 Real Analysis II, Math 4431 Introduction to Topology, Math 4432 Intro to Algebraic Topology, Math 4441 Differential Geometry, Math 4699 Undergrad Research, Math 4802 Math Problem Solving, Econ 3161 Econometric Analysis (I would also love to double major in Economics).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would love the community's insights on three aspects, which I will list below for ease of reading:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How heavily do the upper division mathematics courses rely on the use of computer skills/programming.  I know that mathematics majors will eventually learn programs like LATEX, SageMath, Python, etc., but I wanted to know if the mathematics courses tend to comprise of heavy background knowledge of programming skills/CS-related projects. \n2. What is the outlook for Pure Mathematics at Georgia Tech?  I listed a few courses that felt more \"Pure Mathematics\" than \"Applied Mathematics\" above, but as I am still a newbie at college mathematics, I would love the community's perspective.  Are there many pure math courses/opportunities at Tech?\n3. Finally, I would love the community's evaluation of the strength of Tech's Pure Mathematics in terms of applying for a Ph.D. in Pure Mathematics.  I know Tech has a really strong Applied/Computational Mathematics department which sets students up for good graduate programs, but what about Pure Mathematics?  Is there a lot of pure math research at Georgia Tech?  I would love to be involved in Pure Mathematics Research. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for your time!  I really appreciate your feedback!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

                "body": "Heyo! I personally was a math major that wanted to focus on data science and probability/statistics, not so much pure (i just noticed they added a data science concentration recently! Dang, wish that was around when I was attending still). I may not be able to fully answer your questions, but I'll give the insight I do have (also I'd keep in mind that it's still early on in your college career- my math interests shifted a lot from when I first started to when I graduated, so I wouldn't try to force a concentration from the get go):\n\n1. Upper level math courses for the most part did not require any high level understanding of any programming languages. If one was used, you were given a thorough rundown of what you needed to know. Some professors preferred you turn work in with LATEX, but that's about it. For math majors, you do not need to do a senior project either, so I'd say programming is minimal for the most part.\n\n2. Curious, what math courses have you taken so far? I really think you need to take the first abstract Algebra and real analysis classes before you have a good idea of your interest levels in pure math. Most of the professors do research into pretty cool fields (perhaps topology for something pure math-ish? There was one prof that i vaguely remember that is in that direction), and I'm sure you would be able to find one that does something you'd be interested in. I will say though, professors sometimes also teach classes not related to their research field, so you may need to ask around to find the right prof! Overall though, I think the outlook for pure math is pretty solid for undergrad- you'll be able to build a solid foundation towards pure math easily- as the bridge courses sorta force you to anyway (abstract algebra, real analysis, complex analysis).\n\n3. I can't really provide much insight for this one, hopefully someone else can chime in. I loved the entire math department- everyone worked together, and if you put in good effort and genuine interest, you will be taken care of, and you'll do super well. You don't have to wait until you've finished undergrad to look into doing research at all- you can try and get in immediately, hence me recommending you find a prof doing research in something you're interested in asap. Loved undergrad, just not sure what it's like postgrad. \n\nI really like the selection of classes you listed though if you want to do pure math! I will warn you, they're all pretty rigorous. I was never the strongest at pure math so you'll likely fare better than I did, but just a fair warning haha. Also- I'd prioritize taking classes that you find interesting, even if it's not the exact concentration you want to do (I recommend 4032 combinatorial analysis and 4280 info theory a lot!). It's a pretty small tight-knit community here I'd say for math, hope you're able to find what you're looking for!",

                "body": "First, if you are serious about getting into top 30 programs for PhD, you should try to take foundational graduate classes like analysis, algebra, topology, etc (ideally your junior year so it shows up on your transcript in time). Tech offers a lot more graduate pure math classes and you can use them to fulfill your degree requirements.\n\nTech offers a few REUs in the summer and there is some advantage of getting in as a Tech student since the people running it might know you. You can check the past REUs to see the pure math projects. Tech has a big combinatorics focus which is also an area that will most likely lead to publications as undergrads.\n\nOther than REU, I don\u2019t know many undergrads doing research with professors. I can see that some professors are already overwhelmed with grad students, but some professors don\u2019t have many students so it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask. For areas that are not as accessible as combinatorics (which are most areas), grad schools don\u2019t expect you to do publishable research. Doing reading courses on some advanced topics with experts of those topics would serve you well because 1. It shows you can handle the difficulty of near research-level math 2. A world expert on this topic can write a strong reference letter for you. 3. Maybe you can find an accessible research topic as a result. In that sense Tech can help you achieve that. Plus there is the directed reading group led by postdocs and grad students if professors aren\u2019t available.\n\nAlso if you are serious about math PhD, I would caution against double-majoring Econ as nothing there would help you in your career (pure math or industry) and you would waste precious time for your grad courses progression. Learning programming would be quite helpful since math academia has gotten so competitive that many PhDs won\u2019t stay in academia and end up coding one way or another. It\u2019s best if you learn the skills (e.g. Python) early on.",

Doing computational math research would be a great way to learn as well. Also many math PhDs (like at Tech) don\u2019t differentiate pure and applied math, so your applied research can still beef up your applications and then you can study pure math once you get in. But it\u2019s always good to have backup plan in SWE/Data Science/ML/finance etc. Pure math is fantastic for intellectual growth, but not so much for career growth outside of finance.",

I understand there were probably issues with people hoarding classes with this kind of structure, but it still sucks knowing that I have to either give up my spot and do an 8am (I barely woke up when I did 930 classes) or just pray that my waitlist will make it.

I doubled in math and engineering and the coursework really ate up my time for research projects.  I feel like it was worth it for me, but mostly because I enjoyed studying math and less because the credential has been professionally valuable.

Either way I am aware of the huge workload and will do something if things turn out to be more difficult.\n\nI did turn down the offer for TA, it probably makes more sense to focus on research.",

If anything, that\u2019s when they need you the most \u2014 and that\u2019s when you\u2019ll be the least able to do the bare minimum as a TA, let alone go above and beyond. Overworked TAs are not good TAs. If you\u2019re juggling seven finals and undergrad research obligations along with needing to be responsive via email/piazza, holding office hours, and grading / proctoring, you will simply not be able to be as present as you should be (or, hopefully, as much as you should *want* to be). \n\nLooking back, my personal opinion is that top students would probably be able to get As and Bs even if recitations and review sessions didn\u2019t exist. TAs make the biggest difference for those who would\u2019ve otherwise gotten a C/D (or at least that level of understanding, regardless of their grade) but ended up doing well, or even great, thanks to you. It can also be the crucial safety net that prevents certain people from failing a weed-out course and rage quitting on their major too early.\n\nTAing can be a very rewarding experience if done properly, but if it\u2019s going to be juggled with eight other priorities, a) you\u2019ll do the bare minimum and it won\u2019t really be worthwhile for you, and b) it\u2019ll be flat-out detrimental to those whose learning and overall course experience hinges on you.",

Definitely not worth it with that heavy of a schedule. You have to make sure you don\u2019t fall behind on grading and being at 18 without the TA is a heavy enough schedule plus the research. You would have hell of a time and if you think that\u2019s okay go for it but I see no benefit in that. Other departments tend to be easier + pay more.",

That being said, I was wondering if there is anything specific y'all suggest I must do before I am no longer an undergrad.\n\nI know about the Technique's list of things to do before graduation, but I guess I mean more \"off the beaten track\" suggestions, or anything you guys experienced that you feel Tech students should experience at least once.\n\nI also started my undergrad in 2020, so my first semester was completely online, and there are a few professors I was meaning to meet with before I leave. Are there any other such activities with regards to being a \"covid freshman\"? \n\nThanks!\n\nP.S. I guess this is on and off for me, but there are certain times when it really gets to me that I am almost done (it's that Tech Stockholm Syndrome everyone talks about lol) and I would regret not doing certain things. I know it's very common to feel this as graduation gets closer and that it's natural, but for those who dealt with those feelings, what assuaged it?",

While it's the same degree, if your interests are in other than ML, HCI, Systems, robotics, and interactive intelligence, I think an on-campus program will benefit you more; in particular, CSE classes (there's a reason why they are called CSE, not CS) and tracks like Scientific Computing and HPC are only offered on campus since some of them involve MATH classes as well. Plus, you could also tell your peers that you got into a program with 5-10% acceptance rate LOL. \n\nbut I would be in mid-20s, starting afresh back in my home country -&gt; lol, you need to change this mindset, my friend.",

But if yes, then check if Tech satisfies your other priorities... and if still yes, then apply, do the work, pay the money, and cross your fingers.",

When we moved to blue on white with Bobby Ross starting in 1987, it was always odd to me but over time I have accepted that blue is the third color of our set. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t hate the black look, I think it\u2019s confusing to our identity - and has some seriously bad vibes thanks to its use in 2020 and that Bowling Green game this year - so I would prefer we retire it to our history. I thought we looked more like the New Orleans Saints or Purdue this year than Georgia Tech. And given how we played, that\u2019s probably good we were incognito! \ud83e\udd23\n\nI agree I have never seen a blue yellow jacket so I am ok with Buzz still using black. I am primarily a white and gold/yellow guy. I do have navy tops and hats, but I almost never wear them to games. But I do not buy black and yellow Tech gear for the above reasons.",

Our colors are \"White and Gold,\" not \"Gold and White,\" so perhaps that has somethign to do with it. \n\nIf you're interested in the history of Tech football, go find a used copy of Dodd's Luck to get an idea of his perspective on his time at Tech. It's a good read, as is \"Focused on the Top\" (about the 1990 National Championship season), :Dress Her in White and Gold,\" and \"You Dropped It, You Pick It Up\" (about the 222-0 Cumberland game - hard to find, and currently runs &gt;$400 on most used book sites, but a fun read.)\n\nWelcome! If you haven't learned the words to \"Up With the White and Gold,\" \"I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech,\" and the Budweiser song, get to it!\n\nBTW - it's tough to come up with my favorite football uniform combo. While I loved the navy jerseys from the 1990 year, as well as the mustard jerseys from the Calvin Johnson era, I think the best would be Gold/White/Gold, followed by White/Gold/White.

Anyways, I have been to Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate ever since I was little.\n\nBut just for clarification so I don't get killed here, I have been a UGA fan my whole life due to my Uncle going to their law school(so I actually do have a reason to pull for them \ud83d\ude02), but even as a little kid, I always liked Buzz and Georgia Tech (I even got a picture with Buzz as an 8 year old with Georgia on \ud83d\ude02). Even though I liked Tech, I really have gotten into it recently due to my plan to get an engineering degree. So I hope that explains my story of why I pull for Tech and UGA \ud83d\ude05.\n\nNow with this information, I have a pretty funny story to tell you about the recent rivalry game. After the game, I forced my Uncle to go with me to the little \"spirit store\" inside the stadium gates. Now keep in mind, my Uncle and I are wearing Georgia head-to-toe(I had a Georgia hat, Georgia shirt, jacket, hoodie, chain, ring, sweatpants, AND slides \ud83d\ude02). I waited in line and everyone was staring at us, but when I asked,\"How much is the hoodie?\", every Tech and Georgia fan in like a 30 feet radius stopped in their tracks and the cashier said,\"Excuse me?\".

Various shades of yellow have been used to approximate gold. Using an accent color allows you to use gold on parts of the uniform that are easier, e.g. helmet, numbers, piping, and have options other than solid white. The accent color changed from black to navy blue sometime in the 80s, but I don\u2019t know why.\n\nThe classic home uni to me is white jerseys, gold pants, gold helmet with solid white GT. This keeps the accent color to a minimum.\n\nOf course baseball and basketball uniforms are all fabric, so again the gold is tough. Those uniforms have always been white or relied heavily on the accent color.",

Navy blue and variations of gray and silver have always been popular accent colors, though I think someone mentioned navy recently being elevated to an official color.\n\nThe yellow you are referring to is likely athletic gold, a popular alternative to regular gold for fabrics.

I think today it's probably python but I haven't actually looked that up. \n\nEither way the classes aren't meant to teach you how to program in one language over another, they are meant to teach you basic programming techniques like basic sorting algorithms, how to alter an image, what for loops and if statements are, and how to make a basic graphical user interface. \n\nThe language used is just a choice made by the university. Personally I think it's pretty cool that they didn't keep all of the fundamental programming classes the same language (1301, 1331, 1332) but I never took 1301 because I had AP credits (which requires java btw)",

Ik my opinion here is every unconventional, but I really liked it. Most of the problems people complained about on Ratemyprof came from the very format where 1,500 students are in it per 1 very busy prof and like 20 TAs, the lack of organization was very apparent and frustrating, but as a whole, it was interesting. Some homeworks had a max 2 submissions, but again, this was due to 1500 students overloading Gradescope, it wasn't inherent to the class or professor's desire to make your life miserable, it's because GA Tech can't hire enough people to teach CS 3600. I don't think they'll do it again bc now the class size is back to normal. Not all lectures were taught by Starner, but the ones he did were great. And he has such a wide background in all sorts of AI research that he offers insight that you usually wouldn't see in lectures. He also curved the grade so that median and higher is A, if I'm not mistaken (don't remember this one for sure).\n\nSome of the HWs had extra credit, and it was legitimately interesting. For example, for minimax there was a bot fight at a strategic game. Graphs had navigation in a real map of Atlanta with thousands of points. Also, some of these hws are good resume material.",

The program director wouldn't put that on there unilaterally. \n\nMost faculty fill GTA positions from people who take the class and talk to them, and as you noted, some classes have their own process that supersede the department-wide GTA app. A cold application generally doesn't get you anywhere if they don't know you and in a large class, they know several people. It's the same with upper division undergraduate classes. An application exists, but most positions are filled via students who talk to the professor. \n\nThere's no single person that does GTA hiring. The best way to get a position is to take a class and get to know the professor. You would talk to them about TA stuff and they hire you via whatever means they want, whether that's the GTA form or something else.",

However, the email makes it seem as if filling out the application is enough, when in reality if all you do is fill out the application that's basically akin to not applying at all. \n\nI had a decent relationship with a few professors, not so good that they would remember me from the last time I talked to them when taking their class last semester, but good enough that if I mentioned to them in an email or in person that I was looking for a TA position they would have given me a shot. Unfortunately, the email made it seem as if this would be counted against me, so I didn't talk to those professors until it was too late. Maybe talking to someone in person doesn't fall under \"do not contact\" but how am I supposed to know that? \n\nI'm not angry that they put that info on the email to intentionally mislead us, because they didn't. But as usual how it goes with GT, it isn't the full picture, and I got screwed because I listened to them instead of doing what I thought was right.",

Perhaps something in the same area you\u2019d like to study. \n\nMy wife was not a scholar but she did get into Tech early via starting a community program to get girls into STEM. This is something along the lines of what I\u2019d expect it takes to become one. \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s extremely selective among a pool of candidates which itself is already extremely selective. But even if you don\u2019t succeed, you will open opportunities for yourself that you wouldn\u2019t have otherwise had by making the effort. You could even get external scholarships that could help you pay your way through college.\n\nBest of luck!",
