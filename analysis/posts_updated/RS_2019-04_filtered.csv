Dear College of Computing community,

I am pleased and proud¬†to welcome¬†Charles Isbell as the next Dean of the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Charles has been a strong leader for our college community for some time. He helped design our award-winning Threads curriculum for undergraduates. He helped to create¬†our OMSCS program. He is the founding executive director of the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing. And of course, he has served as our Executive Associate Dean.

He is also a top-flight researcher. Charles has won two best-paper awards for his work in artificial intelligence. He is a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery and of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. He has also sat on multiple advisory boards for the NSF and for DARPA.

As I know all too well, the dean‚Äôs position for the College of Computing is one of the most challenging and rewarding jobs in the entire field. I look forward to seeing Charles rise to the challenge, and I will help him in any way that I can. I know that he can count on the entire community to do the same.

I recently found out that I was admitted to Georgia Tech's MSCS program (on-campus). I'm thrilled about getting this opportunity because Tech has such a great name for CS (and I wasn't expecting an admit at all, since I was rejected from a slew of other T-10 programs!), but I'm debating whether it's worth the price-tag as an OOS student.

I primarily want to do a MS program to get more involved in academic research (something I didn't do in my undergrad) and also take far more advanced classes in ML/AI, etc to hopefully land these type of positions post-graduate school. I also want to re-take a few math courses / take a few more advanced optimization, linear algebra, etc courses that I imagine I wouldn't get the chance to do via an online program like OMSCS.

I do have significant industry research experience (I do ML engineering at a non-big N) so I'm hoping to use my background to nail some type of GRA position if I do decide to enroll. **Can anyone shed some light on how difficult it is to find research positions as a masters student?**

I worked pretty hard last year to build up a profile to apply to T-10 schools, and so a big part of me wants to accept just to feel like my work was worth something - I know, I know, not the greatest reasoning, but I'm being honest here. **Could any current / ex-MSCS students share some of their experiences from the program?

I want to inform you about an incident involving the exposure of personal data.

The Institute‚Äôs cybersecurity team is working to determine the extent of the access and to identify the affected individuals.  


The information illegally accessed by an unknown outside entity was located on a central database. Georgia Tech‚Äôs cybersecurity team is conducting a thorough forensic investigation to determine precisely what information was extracted from the system, which may include names, addresses, social security numbers, and birth dates.   


Georgia Tech learned of the illegal access in late March and immediately took action to address the vulnerability. The Institute is committed to the privacy and security of its personal data and deeply regrets the potential impact on those affected.   


The U.S. Department of Education and University System of Georgia (USG) have been notified. The Institute and USG hope to have more information soon, including how to determine who has been affected and next steps.   


We continue to investigate the extent of the data exposure and will share more information as it becomes available. We apologize for the potential impact on the individuals affected and our larger community. We are reviewing our security practices and protocols and will make every effort to ensure that this does not happen again.
