I read some mixed reviews about marc Smith, so I am unable to decide whether to take him or not. I heard Marc has no tests or Finals and only HWs. So, am kinda leaning towards Marc partially coz of this reason and coz his class fits my schedule better.

If you're into politics we hope you'll check out The Ramblin' Conservatives website at [www.ramblinconservative.com](https://www.ramblinconservative.com) and give us a follow via email or via twitter: @RamblinCon.  Colleges tend to be very liberal and while Tech is more in the center than most, a liberal status quo still exists on campus. We hope to spread different points of view through quality commentary.

If you're a conservative leaning student with an interest in writing, graphic design, or photography  then we encourage you to join us at our next meeting. Email us at [ramblinconservative@gmail.com](mailto:ramblinconservative@gmail.com) or DM us on reddit/twitter to learn more. Please include a little about yourself and why you want to join if possible. 

We've joined the Collegiate Network for independent journalism  and hope to keep up the progress in the spring semester. We'd love to have your support! While many may disagree with our viewpoints, we hope you at least recognize the importance of a diverse political culture on campus.

I have always wanted to design aircraft for awhile now, but I have been always concerned about employability in the field. In y'all's opinion, which major is better to switch to for good employability: aerospace engineering or mechanical engineering? I heard from many fellow students that mechanical engineers and computer science majors take a lot of the jobs in the aerospace industry compared to AE majors; is this true? I'm conflicted on this matter and need to make a decision this semester so to not prolong my graduation, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks ;o)!

P.S.: For aerospace or mechaical engineering, I also plan to tack on a computer science minor to my study plan (prob in devices). In addition, I have also considered sticking with CS and doing an AE minor, which I assume would lead me more down the road of avionics and flight control software.

UPDATE (2 months later - in a wholly different world): Welp, if anything, this whole coronavirus situation and the massive lay-offs that has been happening in the aviation industry has pretty much confirmed my fears of job security, so I will stick with a CS major and AE minor. Can't believe a virus helped me make my decision, but it is what it is. Thanks for all the tips guys ;o)! Stay safe and healthy!",positive,0.9915,positive,0.20917658730158736,01/05/2020

I'm a 4th year CS Major, and luckily about to get out at the end of Spring. Before I get out though, a family friend has asked if I could give a personal tour to her elementary schoolers. She and my parents are all Tech alumni, and her daughters already have expressed interest in continuing the lineage, so I'm happy to oblige.

The kids are both already very interested in STEM, and their parents have encouraged this with robotics/coding bootcamps so they have some experience in the actual education and whatnot. My understanding is they're really interested in robotics and everything associated, so I think it'd be super cool to highlight that, but I'm not sure how, since my only experience has been with the horrid ECE 2031 'robots' that I constantly try to forget. 

I'll take whatever; suggestions, places to go, events to see, information about the programs, I know very little and would like to learn so I can encourage them to eventually come to Tech.

posts,"Textbooks 101. Hey everyone. I was gonna make this post Monday but I forgot but just like my assignments, it's better late than never so I thought I'd give y'all some info on buying textbooks at the bookstore to help our lives go just a little bit smoother. I've seen so many cases where students can't be helped, and it hurts to see it happen. Be sure to know what you're getting into before buying a textbook.

1.  The last date to return textbooks is January 13! It's the Monday after classes start. After that, you have about month to return a book **if** you drop a course and everything is pretty much final sale.
2.  Access codes **can't** be returned if you open a seal or scratch off the code. **Don't** open it until you know for sure you have the right one.
3.  Most plastic wrapped books **cannot** be returned if you open the shrink wrap.
4.  If you need help finding a book, make sure you tell the person helping you the course abbreviation, course number, and section e.g. Math 1000 Z. Please don't just spew a textbook name at us. There are too many books and my brain cells are already fried from Math 1000.
5.  The bookstore only orders books based on information that professors give us. That being said, if we can't find the book you're professor told you was definitely at the bookstore, your professor also definitely didn't submit a request for adoption of said book. Bring your syllabus, so we can order it for you, and also ~~nag fervently at your~~ politely inform your professor, so they know students can't find their book at the bookstore.
6.  Rentals are due back during finals week by April 30th.
7.  Rentals **need** a debit or credit card to have on file in case you don't return your textbook even if you pay with cash or anything other than credit or debit.
8.  We take Apple Pay and other mobile payments, however they **cannot** be used to secure a rental, meaning you still need a physical card present to rent books.
9.  Yes, you read that price correctly.
10. No, there is no student discount.
11. Lots of titles run out of used copies. Usually, they are a first come, first served basis, and we will only get new copies in stock.
12. Digital books are available for certain titles. They are delivered through your email by a service called yuzu.
13. We price match Amazon and BN.com textbooks. Hooray! Restrictions apply. **Oh no**! Textbooks have to be **sold and shipped** directly by Amazon or BN otherwise we can't price match. The condition must also be the same so new goes with new, used goes with used, and rentals with rentals.
14. Bursar billing let's you charge textbooks to your bursar account, however we have no control over this. You have to authorize us to be able to charge your books to your bursar account through buzzport under registration. If you are thinking about charging to your bursar, **please** authorize us **before** you come in. It can usually take up to an hour or two once you hit authorize before we can charge your bursar.
15. Bursar billing can also be used to buy school supplies!
16. Bursar billing is available until **Thursday** when the bookstore closes.
17. We have textbooks out on the shelfs for the first two weeks of school for students to grab what they need. After those two weeks, you can't go grab those books yourself, be sure to ask someone to find what you're looking for!
18. \*\*\*Most access codes are **physical** and have codes that scratch off. If you place an order online, you will still have to come to the bookstore in person to pick up your access code.
19. \*\*\*Lastly, **please please please** do not order your books online an hour before coming in to pick them up. I can almost guarantee they are not ready. We are always swamped with orders during the first two weeks and it's possible we are just getting to orders placed the day before. You **will** get a separate email once they are ready for pickup. If you need them in a hurry, please come in instead of placing an online order.

I hope this post clears up at least a few things about buying textbooks at the bookstore. Also, remember that you have plenty of options when it comes to buying textbooks whether it be buying access to homework directly from the publisher online to third party marketplaces. Used books are almost always as good as new books. Also check the GT thrift shop on Facebook because they have pretty good deals on books there too.

We are creating a team of 6 undergraduates for the 2020 [student cluster competition](https://www.studentclustercompetition.us/index.html), a 48 hour hackathon with 6 months of prep time, held at [SC20](https://sc20.supercomputing.org/). We will design and build our own server hardware by contacting folks like Nvidia and AMD for sponsorship, parallelize and optimize software to run on it, and teach you all about supercomputing (HPC) along the way. If the idea of large computers that run fast interests you, we would love to have your join us! Please reply/DM for questions.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi there! I am the graduate adviser for the upcoming Student Cluster Competition at Supercomputing 2020. For the **first time in the history of this conference, it is being held here in ATL**. As the home institute, **we are planning on having a huge showing and want to win the cluster competition.** This is an international venue with a lot of prestige, and we are recruiting anyone who has an interest in putting GaTech on the map. As someone who has done this during their undergraduate days for two years, let me tell you, this is the most fun I have had in an academic club and where I have learned a lot of practical skills.

**We can also give you course credit**, as there is a VIP course set up around this. It only meets one hour a week (Mondays from 3 to 4) and will walk you through all aspects of HPC and the competition. Look for VIP course with Rich Vuduc as the instructor, or ask me to point you to it :)

**About the competition:** The competition itself announces a set of programs (usually around 6) to be run on the cluster hardware sometime in March. We contact sponsors and design hardware around these and submit a proposal to the conference around April. Then we have six months to build that cluster and optimize the codes to run as fast as possible on our hardware. During the competition itself, held on the Supercomputing conference showfloor, teams have 48 hours to run all of their codes and submit results. There are also activities such as the power-cut where the power is randomly shut off, as well as a mystery application that is only announced once the competition starts.

**About the conference:** SC is the premiere tier-1 HPC conference held in November of each year. About 14,000 people attend it and it is the go to venue for any player involved in large scale computing, whether it be folks like Nvidia, Intel, AMD, software vendors like Google Cloud or AWS, the national labs like LLNL or the various other players in compute/networking/storage/software world. **The conference also holds a career fair for students just like you** :)

If this sounds interesting to you, or you have more questions, please feel free to DM me or reply to this post!",positive,0.9973,positive,0.21456280788177343,01/08/2020

LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE: At the time I got my fillings, the dental office told me I'd be 100% covered by my insurance, so I went ahead and got the fillings done, thinking I'd have to pay $0. What the office didn't know,  or at least didn't tell me, is that the UHC dental insurance has a coverage max of $74 per filling (for the kind I was getting). This means that UHC covered 100% of each of my fillings, up to $74. Everything beyond the $148 (2 fillings x $74) was my responsibility.

So, anyone have a good dentist that's covered by the new insurance?

[Situational Awareness 2020-1.3](http://prepare.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/SitReps2020/sitrep_20200109_2020-1.3.pdf)

We're still expecting strong storms this evening impacting between 6PM-8PM with severe winds being the primary concern.  We've seen hundreds of damaging wind reports upstream from this event in Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas and expect that to continue across Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia today.  There is still a chance for QLCS tornadoes, which are embedded within a squall line.  The updated Outlook from the Storm Prediction Center has us still in the Slight Risk category, although the Enhanced Risk region was expanded into parts of west Georgia.  Expect a Tornado Watch for the region later today.  As the storms approach, we'll be posting on our [twitter account](https://twitter.com/gtpdalerts).  

If you have any questions let us know!

Update Friday, January 10th at 5PM

[Situational Awareness 2020-1.2](http://prepare.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/SitReps2020/sitrep_20200109_2020-1.2.pdf)

Not many changes from the initial post yesterday, (see link above).  We have a bit better confidence on timing (6PM-8PM) for the impact, but the hazards remain the same with strong, straight-line winds being the primary concern and some embedded tornadoes (QLCS variety) being the secondary concern.  The good news is that the system should push through quickly, so do not expect a lengthy event.

\-William Smith, GT Office of Emergency Management

[Situational Awareness 2020-1.1](http://prepare.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/SitReps2020/sitrep_20200109_2020-1.1.pdf)

We're expecting severe weather this Saturday (4PM-10PM) in the form of damaging straight-line winds and tornadoes embedded within a squall line. See the link above. Be mindful of your plans Saturday afternoon and evening, especially if you plan on being outdoors or traveling.

We'll provide an update tomorrow (Friday) and again Saturday morning.  Let us know if you have any questions.

hello tech students! prospective transfer student here! (yeah I know yall are sick of us but we always appreciate the advice!!) I'm planning on transferring this coming fall semester, but I'm having a lot of trouble deciding what to major in. (and with the fall transfer app coming up the stress is really ramping up whew)

I was originally planning on majoring in Neuroscience, but I'm (very) worried about future job prospects and salary. My next interest is ChBE, but the competition for the major (especially for transfers) and the rigor makes it a shaky choice. I was also thinking Biology with a specialty in Biotechnology, but for the same reason as neuro (bio being a pure science), I'm unsure.

so I wanted to know more about your major! tell me what you love/hate about it and why (if youd like!) go into as much/as little depth as youd like! dont worry; i dont count on this post being my number one deciding factor, but i would love to read some comments about why students are passionate about what they study :')

advice is very welcome! questions are also very welcome and will be answered to the best of my ability.

 Date:               Wednesday, January 15, 2020  
 Time:               11:15 AM - 12:05 PM                      
 Location:          Klaus Bldg., Room 2443

Seminar Title:   **Beyond Engineering: Marketing, Sales, &amp; Management with an Engineering Degree**        
Abstract of Talk:    Your career as an engineer can take you to some unexpected places, many of them outside of what is considered ‚Äúpure engineering‚Äù. Using an autobiographical and anecdotal format, Dr. Wilkinson will walk through career branches and options from small startups to large conglomerates, from low-level employee to the leader of a pivotal group, from a job in a lab to a job with a million frequent flier miles, and from a job that‚Äôs pure engineering to a career beyond engineering.                                                  

For those who have access, I am told that the announcement is [here](https://gatech.instructure.com/courses/32398/announcements/99761) with all sorts of other details.

Feel free to ask questions here if you have any, but in person is even better. As an added bonus (if you like books), I took these talks, added some other stories less suitable for a lecture, included some interesting facts about telecommunications, and turned them into a book. Send me a message before the class and I'll bring you a free copy.

**Equifax Security Transformation and the Future of Cybersecurity**  
*Jamil Farshchi, the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of Equifax.* 

The roster of companies suffering massive cyber breaches keeps growing and the headlines are becoming commonplace. While every breach is different, there are shared elements that come up time and time again. Understanding what went wrong can help us better prepare, respond, and prevent future attacks.

Jamil Farshchi, Equifax CISO, has spent his career building industry-leading cybersecurity programs.

posts,"Depressing TED Talk. Hello, if this topic isn't allowed/inappropriate for the sub, please remove the post.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've just been wondering, how do you guys cope with life? In reality, I can imagine that there are a lot of extremely introverted people here at Tech. There's the ones that don't really want to talk with others, the ones who don't know how to talk to others, and the ones who are scared to talk to others. In honesty, it's a pretty hard cycle to break out of and think about even though for some people we obviously recognize that it's there and that it's a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know about others, but I know for me at least, it got me thinking a lot about life and what exactly it was I wanted to do with it. I lack the social skills. I don't exactly have a great understanding of modern culture: I don't know the latest, popular songs (probably even as far back as 5 or 6 years); I don't know what movies are out; I don't really know how to hang out with others and just have fun. I am grateful to say that I have friends that I talk to and hang out with, but there's always this constant fear in the background that it will end. It will be over. I can't say that I am especially close with them considering I'm not a guy that knows what to say to others or how to bring life to a party or a hangout. I also have so many inhibitions. Somehow on my way of growing up, I locked myself into the mentality to not swear, not sing, not dance, not act out, and not talk, but that's all fine for me. All that makes me feel comforted is being in the presence of others that I care about. Nothing has to be said and nothing has to be done but the fact that they are there. 

&amp;#x200B;

But with the end of college coming so soon, I'm afraid of all that ending. We'll all go our separate ways, live our separate lives, and considering my personality, they'll just eventually just fade away. At that point, it'll be even harder to hang out with them, find reasons to contact them, and for me at least, finding things to talk about. I just feel like I'm the type of guy that'll just disappear once everything is over.

&amp;#x200B;

For a while now, I thought of what it might be like to start dating, the idea of finding someone that I care about and would hopefully be able to be with and live our lives out together, but that just looped back to the same questions. What am I going to do in the relationship? Can I even maintain it? What will we talk about? What are we going to do to have fun? Is it even possible? Even worse, did I just want to be in a relationship because I didn't want to feel lonely? And the one common fear, yeah going to get rejected and probably never be able to talk with the person again.

&amp;#x200B;

By this point, I already lost track of what I'm even typing, thinking, or even wanting to get out of this by posting on Reddit. Maybe it's to have someplace to look back on in the future thinking, ""you're stupid, what even made you worry about all this"" or maybe just look back and think ""you predicted the future a bit darn too well."" There's still a bit of time looking into the future, but welcome to my TED talk and thanks for reading.",positive,0.9519,positive,0.07400137741046832,01/15/2020

posts,"Rising Second-Year Community Beginning 2020-2021. Next academic year, the Department of Housing and Residence Life is creating a second-year community. We hope to help foster connection to community and programs specifically designed to help second-year students.


Each year, the Department of Housing and Residence Life surveys students about their on-campus residential experience. Over the years, we‚Äôve learned that second-year residential students feel less engaged and connected than other groups. Additionally, students with higher credit hours have the first choice in room selection. As a result, many second-years have been unable to remain connected with their peers.


At the end of February, when students indicate their choice to live on campus next year, we will determine which spaces in North Avenue Apartments (NAA) we will dedicate to this community.


We expect to have the space for both second-years and upperclassmen based on our data from the past few years. The number of upper-class students and second-years in North Avenue Apartments is not expected to change drastically from previous years.


The application process this year will look the same as it has in years past. However, during self-selection second-year residents will be able to self-select a bed in the buildings assigned to second-years, and upper-class students will be able to self-select from buildings set aside for upper-class students. Some returning students may not have the option to remain in the same bed.


We understand this housing designation is different. Our intention with this change is to provide additional support and resources for every single resident on campus.


We appreciate your patience. Please do not hesitate to contact us with questions at information@housing.gatech.edu.

Sincerely,
Georgia Tech Housing and Residence Life",positive,0.9762,neutral,0.0434818968909878,01/16/2020
posts,"RateMyProfessor for Internships: A GT Startup. TL;DR: Two classmates and I are building a site called [Canary](http://www.canarystudent.com) for anonymized student internship reviews. It's currently in beta and we'd love your review of a recent internship as we try to get over 100 reviews before the InVenture prize (which we're competing in!).

It's 2020 and we can go on Amazon and find a thousand reviews on a $10 soap dispenser, but can't find a single review for internships that may effect our entire careers... Why?

We discovered this problem last year and found that **you simply cannot find internship reviews** despite the hundreds of thousands of interns hosted in the US every summer. There's just no central source like there is for everything else: product reviews, professor reviews, doctor reviews, restaurant reviews, etc.

The end-goal of the platform is to provide an experience where you can plug in all the specific tools or skills that you want to use/ improve at your internship (Ex. C/C++, VHDL, Eagle CAD) and Canary will return a list of all the internships **where students actually did those things, not just  job postings that** ***say*** **you will.**

C2D2 tries to collect this information, as you know if you've ever filled out their survey at the end of an internship, but **they're not allowed to share it because of FERPA.** There's probably dozens of reviews about a position you're applying for right now that you can't access.

We don't take ourselves too seriously, so feel free to ask questions below or DM me!

posts,"Looking for a BADA$$ sports club to join Spring 2020? If so, have I got the club for you!. I am proud to announce that Georgia Tech Water Ski and Wakeboard Club has been resurrected for the Spring 2020 semester!

&amp;#x200B;

First off, what is Water Skiing?

&amp;#x200B;

Water Skiing is the pinnacle demonstration of water sports technical ability and general badassery. A boat driver will tow a person on a ski with a rope around a lake while they do tricks, turns, or go through a set ski course. It's an extremely exciting sport and from personal experience it is an absolute blast.

&amp;#x200B;

Why should I join?

&amp;#x200B;

Other than for the obvious reasons, waterski club will be a great way to make new friends, learn a new skill, get a decent workout and get outside and off campus a little bit! Trips to the lake will be relaxing ventures with water activities and food and will be a great way to get outdoors and catch some sun. Never skied before? Not a problem! We will have people available to get beginners up on their first day! There's no shortage of water sports options available either. Wakeboarding, kneeboarding, trick skiing, and wakeskating are all welcome if the slalom ski doesn't strike your fancy. Still a little apprehensive? Don't be! Come to our informational meeting on Tuesday, January 28th at 6pm in the Campus Rec Center classroom 249 to find out if this is the right club for you.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I get involved?

&amp;#x200B;

Easy! Fill out the form below and come to our meeting on Tuesday, January 28th at 6pm in the Campus Rec Center classroom 249. We will be talking about our schedule for this spring and sharing all information about the club. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me!

posts,"Get Out (2020). Professor: ‚ÄúHello class welcome to CS 3221 object oriented ethics. Lecture is not required, nor is recitation. I actually will not lecture and my TAs will not have office hours. Please understand that you are adults and need to take learning into your own hands. The tests will cover all course materials, but you are expected to learn the entire scope of the subject matter through self-teaching. I will assign an 800$ textbook written in Sanskrit. DO NOT READ FROM THIS BOOK. Grading will be as follows: Participation -10%, Quizzes 2.27%, Homework 1%, final 100%. Please hesitate to ask questions. You will be expected to glean all possible information from my lecture. I will devise a cipher using bongos and a cymbal to encode my lessons. Students should demonstrate a strong passion for learning by being intellectually able to understand the true meaning of my lectures. We will also assign a special section from the 7789 postgraduate class in Topological Quantum Field theory using Scratch. This will (not) (not) be on the final exam. The final exam will be held last week. You have all failed, and out of respect to the Georgia Tech motto ‚Äúfucking die,‚Äù we have decided to invert the curve so that nobody will pass. I will be waiting in the bathroom with Percocets for all those who want to understand the true beauty of computer science‚Äù

‚ÄúOk time for lesson one: first baby steps. Does everyone know how to hold a pencil? Good, excellent. Now in a moment I will pass out pencils and you will all learn to write the alphabet on a sheet of paper. This is the letter A for ‚ÄúAGONY.‚Äù Remember it well. Lesson one is concluded. Turn to page 569 of the text. You will read backwards until you reach page 3, then rip out every log(569-x) page. Oh, you don‚Äôt have the textbook yet? Just transferred from our rival school, [nave], I see?‚Äù

Our prof reaches into the drawer and pulls out a handgun. She shoots the transfer student in the head.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I tell you to take learning into your own hands?‚Äù

She uses a swab to clean the gun, then presses it firmly into the transfer student‚Äôs right hand

‚ÄúLesson two is finding the orthonormal basis for the surface of a toroidal n-gon. YOU MUST USE NODE.js TO PRINT OUT THE ANSWER TO THIS PRINTER‚Äù

She points at a slightly rotting banana on the desk

‚ÄúFurthermore, you must comment ‚ÄòI did not plagiarize this work from anyone. I worked on this code alone in my room and yes I was crying the whole time‚Äô above every line of code. Keep the code short and efficient, must be max 20 characters‚Äù

The prof turns away from the class and stares longingly at the whiteboard. This goes on for around 30 minutes, some of the class try to leave but they get vaporized by the TAs the moment they open the door. In order to escape, the students perform the age old Tech tradition of vibrating at high frequencies to raise the air temperature and destroy the professor.

The students make buzzing noises like our beloved mascot buzz. Buzz buzz buzz (8 deaths from heat exhaustion). The professor begins to get restless from the rising heat. 

‚ÄúOk lesson 3, I fucking decimate you‚Äù

The ceiling begins to droop, and it is revealed that the entire room was the dean of the college of agriculture the whole time. 

‚ÄúWhy hello class‚Äù booms MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol

‚ÄúNot MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol‚Äù whine the students in a bored monotone

All the buzzing ceases and the room returns to normal.

‚ÄúThis is the final exam‚Äù
The professor reveals compressed butane bombs hidden beneath the students‚Äô chairs. Everyone clapped. 

‚ÄúLooks like we‚Äôre finally getting a bump‚Äù

One kid in the back chuckles a little and the professor socks him with a lamp. She leaves the room and all the TA‚Äôs enter and begin to speak in perfect unison.

‚ÄúYou know, I was like you once. Fat, ugly, stupid. But then I learned Sanskrit and finally was able to read the text and it truly opened my eyes and made me not an inferior blind. Furthermore I gained immense intellectual capability and abandoned my ethnicity to become white‚Äù (all of them were already white) 

One of the TAs begins casually humping a table. MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol crushes him with a combine. 

‚ÄúWitness the wonders of the agricultural sciences‚Äù he muses as Monsanto elevator music plays in the background

‚ÄúOh there goes MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol again, always a charmer‚Äù

The TAs begin crying in admiration. 

‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs a donglong I would never hesitate to accept‚Äù

3 more students drop dead. Only 1527 of the original 1544 remain.

From the center of the student mass 80 new Tech students spawn.

‚ÄúOh hello, welcome to Guantanamo Bay - Atlanta campus‚Äù

‚ÄúAh we understand‚Äù says one of the replacement students, an Oriental man in his mid 40s.

‚ÄúOh fuck it‚Äôs Andrew Yang!‚Äù the TA‚Äôs scream. But before they can leave 1000 dollars in nickels has already been stuffed into their ears and they all die. 

The students mumble in despair ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Yang, we‚Äôre saved. woohoo. yeah. Yang2020 am i wrong or am i wrong?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI have come to do battle with my long-standing rival, MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol‚Äù booms the Oriental

MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol uses his agriculture skills to circumvent the 8-fold path and achieve Nirvana, but Yang gets there first.

‚ÄúYour lucky boy‚Äù

Yang rapidly injects 121951.219512 Icelandic Kr√≥na into MR. Farmerhunk@donglong.aol

‚ÄúNothing personnel kid. I will keep my promise to the American people‚Äù

‚ÄúBut the exchange fee! You would have to deduct 0.57% making it under 1000/month!‚Äù

‚ÄúNO MRFARMERHUNKLONGDONGAOL YOU FINALLY REVEALED ME FOR THE FARCE THAT I AM. I AM DEFEATED‚Äù

By reading some previous posts on this subreddit, my understanding is that many people have been able to complete this process successfully. However, I was wondering whether the threads I choose make a big deal when the major change period comes. Right now, I want to be a CS major with intelligence thread. And to do so, I plan on applying to Georgia Tech transfer as a Computational Media major (intelligence-interaction design thread). Do you think this will help me change my major easily because they both the majors have the same threads?

I have done a lot of frontend development for webpages and mobile applications (animations and etc) in terms of interaction design. So I would be eligible for CM transfer in terms of having interest demonstrated for the major.

For people who have done this, do you think this is the best approach for me? I am just looking for guidance. I would like some suggestions. Thank you!",positive,0.9746,positive,0.22679446778711487,01/19/2020
posts,"About to be GA Tech freshman but confused. Hello!

I am a senior in high school and got accepted early action yesterday, so I am excited to attend. However, ever since I applied as an Econ major on my CommonApp application, I have been wanting to change to ITM, but I don't really know if it is possible. If it is possible, how should I make it official with the school and what are the steps? 

I have looked it up online, but none of the websites I have looked at really specified for cases like mine. This is what is stated on the Scheller College of Business: ""ADMITTED FIRST YEAR STUDENTS: Please note first year students will not be eligible to change their major until after the withdrawal deadline in their first term. ¬†¬†

* Students under 60 credits: there is no GPA requirement for students with fewer than 60 credits
* Students with 60 or more credits: students need to have at least a 2.3 cumulative GPA to change their major to Business Administration."" 

I know it says first year students, but does this mean I have no way to change it before I attend?

I talked to a GATech representative at my school last year about changing majors, and she said that they allowed 1 free one if certain criteria are met. Yet, that was 1 year ago, and we only talked for 5 minutes. Any help would be appreciated and thanks.

Edit: Thanks, peeps. From what I understand, I can change/confirm my major during the FASET thing. I was just a bit worried, but everyone's posts cleared that up so thanks again.",positive,0.992,positive,0.11381377551020411,01/19/2020

posts,"Vailable - scheduling app for student organizations (a better when2meet). I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of student orgs and communities use [when2meet.com](https://when2meet.com/) to schedule board meetings and campus events. However after using the app myself, I found that the frontend design is very unattractive and makes it really hard to schedule/enter availabilities on mobile.

I created a new version of when2meet called Vailable ([vailable.io](https://vailable.io/)) that keeps the best parts of when2meet but has a cleaner frontend and more functions. It's totally free and allows you to view people‚Äôs availabilities to choose the best meeting time. I've already migrated a lot of Yale students to the platform and it has been working great so far. I‚Äôm excited to see how it helps student orgs at GTech!

If any of you have any suggestions or features that you would like to see implemented. Please let me know!

I am an international student at GT who just got a Co-op offer recently. I have a question about Co-op programs:

1. Can I quit after one or two rotations when I find I do not like the company (like their management is in a mess or their working environment is so bad)? Will C2D2 impose any penalty on me, like cancelling my eligibility for future CPT?

Co-op seems different from normal internship. I just want to make sure that I still have some flexibility even though I better do three rotations to fulfill the requirement.

I will try my best to keep it short. I am a third year ME major and a transfer student. I‚Äôve been at Tech for a year and a half. I have a fairly typical experience - I was very successful at my previous university, and while I have done decently at Tech, I certainly haven‚Äôt performed up to my former standards. At the points of struggle, I have asked myself if I am in the right major. I am taking things slower because my scholarships allow for it, so I know I still have an ideal opportunity to change majors if I wanted to. 

My question is, for ME students and other majors, what are your experiences with deciding what major was best for you? I often ask myself if I am considering a change because I am not in the right place, or because I am simply being lazy and not grinding things out like I should be. I think I might have allowed some impostor syndrome to slip in - I often compare myself to my peers and imagine that my own position was simply luck and I am not up to par. 

I have skills not typically associated with engineering - good social skills, relating to others, writing, speaking. I guess I just want to determine how to best play to my strengths. But if I make a decision to change, what if I regret giving up one of the best ME programs in the nation? 

I know this is somewhat rambling. I hope you can understand what I‚Äôm asking. Any information regarding deciding on your major, career path, etc would be appreciated. I also am wondering who else might have dealt with a similar sense of inadequacy or feeling of inferiority. 

I sincerely thank anyone who replies in advance.",positive,0.9887,positive,0.25375850340136047,01/20/2020

&gt;  
&gt;Provost Rafael L. Bras has informed me of his intention to step down from his position, approximately Sept. 1, and continue at Tech as a professor.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Provost Bras joined Georgia Tech in 2010, and his decade of leadership as the Institute‚Äôs chief academic officer has resulted in some of Tech‚Äôs largest and most innovative strides in higher education, and I am glad that he will remain at Tech as a professor.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;His legacy and influence are evident in the more than 300 faculty members hired in the past decade and in the new major initiatives in Panama and China. His passion also ignited what is known today as Georgia Tech Arts, a dynamic program that has brought several extraordinary pieces and collections to campus and continues to help the campus community find their own creative voice. He has been a true champion and leader for bold institutional initiatives like Library Next, the launch of the Online Master of Science programs, and the Commission on Creating the Next in Education, among others.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Truly, Provost Bras‚Äô vision has been a driving force for Tech as we have sought creative solutions for how we might bring new programs and pedagogies to life and open Georgia Tech to the world.¬†  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In the coming weeks, I will announce a search committee and provide further details about the transition. Meanwhile, Provost Bras will continue to serve in his current role as the search begins for his successor.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I hope you will join me in congratulating and thanking Provost Bras for his service to Tech and for his greater contributions as a leader, scholar, and educator over a career that has spanned nearly 45 years. I certainly wish him and his wife Pat all the best.

posts,"Regarding Upcoming Changes to 2nd-year Housing. Good afternoon all,

Thank you for communicating your concerns and questions with us over the past week regarding the upcoming changes to 2nd-year Housing for the 2020-2021 academic year. Before you continue reading, we‚Äôd like to explicitly state that the Residence Hall Association is a fully-student run organization and we are not official spokespeople for the Department of Housing and Residence Life (HRL); however, we have, over the past year, worked diligently to build out a strong communication network with HRL to be able to deliver concerns (like those expressed this past week) quickly and efficiently. With that information out of the way, we have an update to provide on this topic.

Below, you‚Äôll find the text of the document discussed with HRL leadership earlier yesterday:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Delivered to HRL leadership on the morning of Tuesday, January 21st*

**Main Concerns**

* Those living in North Ave could lose their current room for next year
* Those applying for housing next year want to know which buildings will be available before they apply

**Questions**

* Will certain floors or certain buildings be reserved for 2nd Year Housing?
* When will we know which buildings will be designated for which cohort of residents?
* What will the housing application process look live for those wanting to live in North Ave?
   * Will there be a preference question for different buildings? floors?
* Will 2nd Years be required to live in North Ave?
* What options for housing are available for 2nd Years?
* How will this impact West Campus and West Campus apartments?
* Will those applying to live in North Ave (upperclassmen) who don‚Äôt currently live in North Ave have a lower chance at getting into a room in North Ave for next year?
* Will a full suite of roommates be prioritized over random self-select applicants?
* Will 2nd Year students be required to live on campus?
* Are time slots based on credit hours, payment date, or application date?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Based on our discussion from yesterday, we can provide the following immediate information:

* The buildings and/or floors that are chosen for the 2nd-year living communities will be directly based on the number of applications for each housing community
* At this time, the exact buildings and/or floors that will be selected for the 2nd-year community are not known and have not been decided
* We should find out soon after the housing application closes (Feb. 23th) the buildings and/or floors that will be chosen for the 2nd-year communities (estimated between Feb 24rd - Feb 28th)

Now, we understand that this information doesn‚Äôt answer a lot of the questions that were asked and there will still be a lot of concerns regarding available housing options this upcoming academic year. As a former resident of North Avenue and current resident on West Campus, I can understand your frustration as the uncertainty with this situation has certainly caused some confusion.

**PROJECT: Web components development with StorybookJS**

Time: 15-20 hours per week  
Duration: Spring 2020 / expansion through mid-June if additional targets met

This project will adapt the newest GT campus theme and common editorial design elements to CMS-agnostic web components.

We will create content components from existing UI/UX research and use cases, along with identified needs from editors.

The finalized components and Storybook instance are expected to be production ready and usable for work portfolios. We will make sure all production work is accessible and identified with your involvement.

This project requires proficiency with:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Git
* Web components (litelement [https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/), direct ECMAscript either)
* Producing clear documentation

Highly preferred experience:

* Storybook JS, latest stable (v5.3.x - [https://storybook.js.org/](https://storybook.js.org/) )
* GT branding and theme targets ( [https://comm.gatech.edu/brand/websites](https://comm.gatech.edu/brand/websites) )
* CMS integration of theme elements with Drupal, Wordpress, and/or any Javascript framework (Node, React, Vue)
* GT Plesk web hosting

&amp;#x200B;

**PROJECT: Knowledge base consolidation and customization**

Time: 15-20 hours per week  
Duration: Spring 2020 / expansion through mid-June if additional targets met

We need to streamline our internal documentation from the units. Many topics of existing FAQ / KB articles can be consolidated to a core topic with details attached for each unit. But we only want to display the unit specific details as appropriate on distributed sites.

This project will help us test and implement a common FAQ depot which then shares these core topics with the unit specifics selectively.

This project requires proficiency with:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Git
* JSON based data population
* Producing clear documentation

Highly preferred experience:

* Drupal 8 / JSON:API
* Oembed or other remote loading shadowDom experience
* GT Plesk web hosting",positive,0.9798,positive,0.06958333333333332,01/24/2020

posts,"Locking virus thread?. Why do you guys think you can get away with a cookie cutter GTPD answer and then locking a thread?

It is not even that hard, either say:

1) That there is no GT student from Wuhan in an Emory hospital, 

2) There is a GT student from Wuhan in Emory hospital, but it is not confirmed if it is just the regular flu or not.

3) There was a GT student, but it was confirmed to be just the flu.


Don't just say wash your hands and lock the thread. This is classic, the subject of the thread was not even addressed. 

I get you are probably trying to stop a panic. But that was pathetic. I can't stand authority figures being dishonest.

Now go ahead and ban this thread. I just wanted the mods to read this.

---------

**Edit** I am sorry mods, most of my frustration is towards the empty GTPD/Stamps post.

--------

**Edit2** There seems to be some confusion about what I meant by dishonesty. What I consider dishonest was that the reply we got did not either confirm or deny the case the thread was talking about. It just ignored it.

---------

**Edit3** Looks like the original thread is [deleted by mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/eugx20/monitoring_the_path_of_coronavirus/ffrca2b/)

Here are the comments from the old thread:

posts,"Monitoring the path of coronavirus. ""  To the campus community,  
 

We have been closely watching reports of a new coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China.  As of today there have been five confirmed cases in the United States. There have been no identified cases at Georgia Tech or in the state of Georgia.  
 

Our health professionals will continue monitoring the situation and are following the direction given by public health experts.  It is important to note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a recommendation to avoid all nonessential travel to Hubei Province, China.  
 

Symptoms of coronavirus are similar to the seasonal flu, which remains the higher risk for our population. This is also the time of year when we typically see a rise in cases of seasonal flu.  
 

Students who have traveled from central China in the past 14 days and have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should contact Stamps Health Services immediately at 404-894-1420. Options for medical assistance outside of normal business hours are available at [health.gatech.edu/after-hours](http://health.gatech.edu/after-hours).  
 

We encourage all members of the campus community to follow the same preventative strategies used during a normal cold and flu season: getting a flu shot, washing hands regularly, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when experiencing symptoms of illness. Students who have paid their health fee are eligible for a flu shot at no charge.  
 

It is recommended that anyone over the age of 6 months get the flu shot, and especially people with chronic medical conditions who are at high-risk for flu-related complications. Information regarding how to get a flu shot at Georgia Tech or what to do if you think you have influenza is available [online at the Stamps Health Services website](http://health.gatech.edu/additional/flu).  
 

Sincerely,  
 

Dr. Benjamin Holton

2. Where is Alfonso in the sexual orientation section, how can you claim to be inclusive if you don't let me exclusively fuck people named Alfonso.
3. My major is obviously computer science, don't make me say it when you already know. It's like asking about my weight or my age.
4. What are all of these political affiliations? Come on, don't make fun of me more than you already are. Me papi told me the only real way to govern a people is through Alfonso Anarchic-Communism .
5. My ethnicity is obviously white, whiter than the sun. Alfonso white.
6. The only way you can take someone seriously is if they're Alfonso Anarchic-Communists, so get rid of all of these other joke options.
7. Alfonso-ism is not recognized as the only real religion here. The only options I see are fake, fake, fake, and putting down shamefully the only religion that matters in the other box.
8. Again, my partner needs to actually worship a respectable god, like Alfonso.
9. If his name is Alfonso is not an option to choose from and for the last time, the only real gender is worthless or ALFONSO.
10. Why is there no ""It's important that my IQ is higher than the plebeians (My ""peers"") ""

Well, I hope you take the time to make these important changes to your worthless survey and you'll all surely burn in AlfonsHell. Just think of my suggestions like the ten commandments, suggestions that are completely mandatory if you don't want to burn in AlfonsHell.

posts,"Accepted From OOS -- What Should I Know?. Hi all,

I was admitted to Georgia Tech for grad school (yay!). I am currently finishing up my BS, and will be entering for a MS/PhD in Robotics. Maybe I'll be some of yours' TA ;-)

As someone who has lived/studied only in California, this will be my first time really outside CA, and on the other end of the country no less. Currently everything I know about Georgia is from GaTech's Wikipedia page and The Walking Dead. I am sure there are some cultural differences, so far I'm rather surprised by the prevalence of Greek Life and the campus' history.

I have several questions:

- What is the typical cost of living (rent, food/month)? I don't have a car, so this mainly pertains to apartments walking/biking distance from campus.
- When should I apply for housing? How does on-campus compare to off-campus?
- Where does GaTech's student body lie politically/religiously? Please don't turn this thread into a politics discussion.
- Anyone else here from CA? What was your experience?
- How is the air quality? 
- Are guns a thing?
- Is there good Mexican food? Sushi?
- Any cool cultural things I should know of?
- How are summers/winters?
- Is the campus longboard-friendly?
- I heard y'all have bugs...
- Anything else I should know?

posts,"I'm Lost.. I'm feeling very lost and alone here at Tech. 

I was a good kid in high school, got mostly A's as school came easily to me and I didn't have to study or apply myself much, y'know, typical ""gifted student"" in elementary and ""overachiever"" in high school type scenario. If I struggled with something, I always thought it just wasn't for me. I have struggled with depression and anxiety since middle school, and I never had many friends in school to hang out with in the first place. Being an introvert, I usually isolated myself and never talked about my mental health with my parents or any of the few friends I had. I always thought that in college it will get better. I'll get away from past traumas and make new friends and have new experiences, and everything will get better. 

I got into Tech with an amazing scholarship that not many people get, and all I had to do was keep a 3.0. Seems easy, right? In the fall, I registered for 16 credits, coming in with a few from AP's. Six classes didn't seem like so much since I always took 7 in high school. Prior to classes starting, I attended FASET and Wreck Camp and got out of my introvert shell a bit, meeting new people and having some generally fun times. College was a new start for me, and I was interested in reinventing myself. However, being the introvert that I am, after faset and wreck camp, I didn't strive to keep the relationships that I had made, and everyone drifted away, making their own new friends. I became friends with my roommates, we would do fun stuff together occasionally on the weekends, but I didn't really make any other friends besides them. Going to classes and walking around campus seeing everyone hanging out and studying with their friend groups made me even more depressed, thinking that I wouldn't make any friends since everyone had already made their own friends. 

Throughout the semester, my depression and anxiety continued to get worse, building with my declining grades. I eventually lost all motivation to exist and get out of bed, no friends to fall back on or hold me accountable for anything. I felt so lost and lonely, even on a campus of over 30,000 students, I didn't feel at home at Tech or even like I belonged here in the first place. I tried getting help academically by attending plus sessions, TA hours, and culc tutoring, but nothing was seeming to work. I was completely overwhelmed by my six classes, not being able to fit enough hours of studying and existing in the day and also getting enough sleep to function. No motivation mixed with the absolute inability to focus on anything makes for a really bad time. 

I tried telling my parents that I needed mental help, but they kept denying that there was anything wrong with me mentally. ""Just change your attitude,"" ""You're too negative,"" ""Nothing's wrong with you, stop pitying yourself so much,"" etc. was common to hear any time I brought up mental health. Tech's mental health resources were of no help to me. They told me surface-level things that I could look up on the internet, like making friends and getting a hobby. I don't think they were even listening when I talked about my extreme social anxiety, based on those recommendations. I understand that they have a ton of students to deal with, but come on, you could at least be a little bit more personal with your patients. By the end of the semester, my mental health was worse than it ever had been, I barely studied at all for my finals, and all I wanted was a couple friends to reach out to and have fun with. The whole time, I knew I had to keep a 3.0, but all I wanted to do was pass my classes to get them over with. Nothing in my classes was interesting to me, and frankly I didn't care about them. 

Getting my final grades back totally crushed me. I failed calculus by barely two points, tanking my GPA to much below what is required to keep my scholarship. I was home for the holidays, and I don't think my family was ready for the massive anxiety attack I was about to have. I was a failure, I didn't deserve to live or even go to college anymore. If i couldn't even pass the first math class of my major, how was I even supposed to THINK about doing the rest of them? My winter break was absolutely ruined. I sat around in my room all day and isolated myself, wallowing in my own self-hatred and depression. Finally, my parents started to realize that I needed help. They helped me find a therapist in the area to see while I'm in school. I've seen them about three times, and I know it takes a while, but I don't know if it's even working. I'm so damaged to the point where I don't think anything will help except maybe strong medication.

Currently, I'm taking the next level of calculus even though I failed the first class, and I am having MAJOR test anxiety. I try to study, and I can't physically bring myself to focus on studying. Its near impossible. There are millions of thoughts on my mind constantly, drowning out me barely trying to read the practice problems. Nothing has changed since last semester, and I feel like I'll fall into the same spiral of bad grades and poor mental health. I still don't have any friends this semester, and that's honestly really all I want out of college. I think that having at least a few friends would make my existence suck a little less. This semester I feel like it's my last chance to prove that I deserve to be here and to not lose my scholarship, but I'm wasting it away by not studying when I know damn well that I should be. I've tried basically everything except studying with other people, half because of my crippling social anxiety of talking to others and half thinking I'm too stupid for anyone to want to study with me. High school didn't prepare me at all for college. I have horrible time management, zero study skills, and add my awful mental state on top of that. I don't want to fail again. I can't fail again. I really need help, and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so lost here.

Sorry for venting, I thought it might be a good idea to reach out, y'all are better at this college thing than me.",negative,-0.9989,neutral,0.02566845914502166,01/29/2020

Several questions:

2, Can employers rescind the offer after you sign the offer letter? My understanding is most employment relationships in the US are 'at-will'. That means they can revoke everything without any legal liability. Correct me if I am wrong.

3, If my understanding to question 2 is correct, what can we do in this situation? Can we ask the officers in C2D2 to step in? Is there any other resource that we can use to give pressure to the firm?

Any input will be appreciated!

posts,"I don't qualify for in-state tuition?. So...my family and I have lived in GA all our lives, but my parent never filed taxes. They sent me an email saying that I don't qualify for in-state tuition because you have to do fafsa and/or give them a copy of your parent's state tax return (none of which I can do). I looked on USG's policy, and they say (for dependents) that as long as your parent has been domicile for 12 months and you've graduated from high school, you qualify for in-state tuition. But GT kept telling me that they need a tax return from my parent, otherwise I only qualify for out-of -state tuition. 

Do I have to wait until I graduate to qualify for Zell/HOPE? The deadline for all financial aid documents is today, though.",positive,0.6261,neutral,0.0275,01/31/2020
