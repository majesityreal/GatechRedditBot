post,"Do ASE grades show up on your transcript? Is it possible to drop an ASE before taking it?. I signed up for the 3012 ASE and am really worried about potentially failing. I'm taking Thang Le's final, and having gone through the practice material, I'm not entirely confident I'll pass.

According to [this](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/advanced-standing) page, it says ""An examination for advanced standing will be reported with an S or U grade. Neither grade will be included in the calculation of the scholastic average."" Per the Wayback Machine, it's been like this since at least 2018. I did ask around, and someone that failed a psych ASE a couple years ago said it didn't show up on their transcript. Just now, I checked my unofficial transcript and saw my CS 1301 passing ASE grade on it - is the policy now different or something? Do only S grades show up? Or am I risking getting a U on my transcript?

I'm concerned that having the equivalent of an F might affect me later on when it comes to grad school.

I'm also pretty confident I'll pass if I take it next semester, and for math classes, I don't think they let you take an ASE for a class more than once.

Does anyone know if you can drop the ASE a few days before the scheduled test date?

post,"(Semi-Rant) GPA for GT grad school physics questions. Hello fellow yackets,

I am a physics undergrad (graduating in Fall 2024), and I transferred to gatech at the start of Fall 2022. Since then, my GPA as well as my mental health deteriorated (though still around a 3.5-3.6), which is by no means bad, but I only expect the physics classes to get harder from here on. The only phys classes at gt thay I have taken are 2232 and 3143 (which I could have gotten an A in if I didn't overlook a tiny detail on a 10 mark multiple choice question on the final, but that's life). I'm nowhere near as productive as I used to be (mental health go brrrr, involuntarily hospitalized for suicide ideation last semester), and now I'd imagine classmech, thermo, electrodynamics, qm2, and statmech are going to be nightmare fuel for me.

I couldn't find any info on the average GPA for grad school physics, but other programs have 3.6-3.7 listed and people at my gt lab said they got in with around 3.6.

This is probably a very stupid question, but does being a current gt undergrad and having faculty connection(s) improve my chance at getting into gt grad physics by a decent amount, even if my GPA keeps dropping? Should I even be pursuing grad school if/when it eventually drops below 3.3 or even 3.0? I've been subtly considering renouncing my dual citizenship with my home country so that raytheon or lockmart can hire me, if even that üò≠

I'm just mad at myself that physics used to be my biggest passion, but fucking up on things that my classmates seem to get so easily and are like ""oh it's obvious, this means that x must be y thus z"" while I'm struggling to understand a lot of it, and that now I think I'm too dumb to continue.

post,"How to get back points without getting Dean involved?. UPDATE: I got a definite no, so it doesn't really matter now. Ty to everyone who responded 

So, I am in this section of CS 3510 with Prof. Furst. The way this class works is instead of curves, we have optional regrades. These are obtained by writing the correct solution and presenting it to a TA during OH, possibly with their guidance. 

For the last HW, this option has been replaced with Grasescope regrade requests. It was announced that RR are available until May 1st, 11:59. 
I submitted a RR and got back a feedback that it isn't enough (I missed an edge case). I was gonna submit it again (Grasescope allows that) once I saw this feedback (Sometime May 1st, NOT the last minute). RR were closed. This class was extremely disorganized (start with the fact they switched the grading scale on the last week of classes), and it was a completely reasonable assumption that they just decided to move the deadline one day earlier. Next day I open Ed and see that it was a Grasescope issue, and it was apparently resolved minutes after I saw it. I reached out to the TA, politely requesting to accept this request, and it was denied. 

I don't wanna go into a confrontation with TAs. 
First, I recognize and appreciate the tremendous amount of labor they've put into all the regrading. Basically, every other student got regrades for every other homework.
Second, my final grade is at their mercy, since I still have no regrade result for the midterm, and also a critical portion of my grade is dependent on subjective evaluation of my ""mastery"" (that's an undeclared percentage of the grade, and I am on the verge between A and B). 

In my understanding, this would typically be a situation to get Dean of students involved (idk for sure though, I've never had this occur before). But due to the reasons above, that's not an option. I have a summer internship dependent on this grade (they have a certain major GPA threshold, or they'll call off the offer).

post,"advice between graduation vs bs/ms. hi jackets,  (throwaway acct by my actual id is absurd, sorry if this looks fake lol)

I'm currently a senior at Tech, currently on track to graduate in Fall 2023 because it took me two university transfers to apply to Tech as a CS major. Because Tech has essentially nullified my GPA, I've only had the opportunity to take the last classes that apply to my threads, where I ended up with a 3.37 GPA so far.

The problem with that is that it's 0.03 (which accordingly to what my advisor and I calculated to be an A-shy of a 3.4) away from being allowed to apply for the BSMS program, so I'm enrolled in a course over the summer to boost myself to a 3.4. However, by doing so, I'm also essentially signing myself to graduate in Spring 2024 the soonest, since that implies that I cannot graduate on Fall 2023, given that's the semester I'd be applying for BSMS eligibility. My advisor has stated that having a 3.4 GPA ‚â† acceptance to BS/MS, but from what I've read over at reddit, it seems that a lot of the people who got in said it's near 100%. 

I intend to get a PhD eventually in the field of HCC/HCI, in which GT is a perfect school to study at. I have been a member at a couple of research labs doing cool stuff, but unable to do get a paper out of them which is my intent towards applying for BSMS w/ Thesis and follow with a PhD afterwards.

The question/advice I have is whether considering extending of my graduation for the sake of doing a BSMS worth it, or should I just graduate and apply to PhD programs elsewhere or y'know, get a job and then apply to MS programs to be covered by an employee of some kind? 

Thank you all in advance! 

TL;DR: senior at Tech, need a GPA of 3.4 to be eligible for a BSMS program in CS, but currently have a 3.37. I am considering taking a course to boost my GPA for BSMS eligiblity, which would delay my graduation until Spring 2024. I am unsure if it's worth extending graduation for the BSMS program or if I should graduate and apply to PhD programs elsewhere or seek employment and then apply to MS programs.

post,"As a transfer, will I lose HOPE due to GA Tech discarding a year worth of credits?. So, the question's in the header. I transferred to GA Tech after my freshman year. As someone here may know, HOPE counts not just hours at current college, but all hours ever taken at any school.

GA Tech discarded around 25 credit hours when I transferred by either counting them as ""free electives"" worth 1 credit hour instead of 3, or completely ignoring them. The exact number is now hard to measure since the [HOPE website](https://www.gafutures.org/hope-state-aid-programs/hope-zell-miller-scholarships/hope-scholarship/academic-eligibility-in-college/) claims that even if the university didn't transfer a certain class, it is still counted in attempted hours. 

Now, I need 126 hours to complete my degree. Does it mean that my last year will not be covered? Since I'll complete 126 credits to complete the degree + 25 throw-away credits of classes that I had to retake or get counted as electives at 1/3 of their credit hours?

Did I misunderstand something? If not, what do I do? There has to be some procedure/way to get funding since transfers are so common here...




UPD:

So, for reasons I don't exactly know, I have way less credit hours than I thought on file. Even less than just what I took at Tech. I can only guess, but I now recall that they may have stated that they only count valuable classes. Stuff like, say, Health or History of Anime may get discarded (no offense towards Health majors if they exist). That is likely how I have so few credits, and it is very likely that this will be the same for many others who end up reading this post.

post,"With the ACC on the verge of collapse, where do you think Georgia Tech will stand when it all settles?. [With the ACC in shambles, and FSU/Clemson wanting to either pull out, or force us to sign onto an unequal revenue sharing agreement](https://www.on3.com/teams/kentucky-wildcats/news/acc-schools-considering-departure-from-the-conference/). I'm interested in knowing what other Yellow Jackets feel about the situation - and how y'all think we should proceed forward!

If the ACC survives, but with an unequal revenue agreement - I'm seriously worried about the future of Tech's programs. Considering unequal revenue sharing is what doomed the Big East, I don't see Tech's already cash strapped programs doing any better here than before. Not to mention, what makes the SEC/B1G so successful is the fact that they *don't do unequal revenue sharing*.

*I personally would love to see us return to the SEC*, since our biggest historical rivalries (besides u\[sic\]GA) are with Auburn and Vanderbilt. And, geographically speaking, it would just make more sense for us to commute to teams the next state over - rather than across the country. [There already seems to be some (admittedly) limited support from fans of the penal colony upstate](https://www.redandblack.com/opinion/guest-column-georgia-tech-to-the-sec/article_d4fa2f86-06da-11ed-84e1-c7aa27eceb89.html) to see us return to the conference we helped co-found. And the SEC could also stand to gain a lot with a new [AAU](https://www.aau.edu/who-we-are/our-members) school too, which could help to lessen their appearance of a 'conference of party schools'.

Unrelated - but the SEC could also send an invite to Tulane too! Which has the same possibility of also helping the SEC's reputation, and would be yet another co-founding member to return!

Besides the SEC, the B1G makes the next most sense as they're already the second most academically prestigious P5 athletic conference in the USA behind the ACC. Although, we would have the same issue with the ACC, of having to commute across the country to play teams we have no history with. At least if this were to happen we could say that we didn't have to sacrifice academics for athletics.

The Big 12 would be an okay middle ground, we would be playing teams we again have no connection with and are really far away - but at least we'd get paid more than we are now!

I hate to say it, but I think we also need to consider the possibility of getting downgraded to a G5 conference too. Tech hasn't done super well in recent years, thanks in no small part to the ""[minister of mayhem](https://twitter.com/tori_mcelhaney/status/1170521351997857792?s=20)"", but I'm hopeful that Coach Key can get us moving in a better direction quickly! If this is the case, and we do get left behind, my money is on the American conference - since they're probably looking to expand into a state they've got no footprint in already. I doubt the Sun Belt conference would want us considering they've already got both GSU's.

The last (and most unlikely) scenario I see as a possibility, would be the PAC-12 and (what's left of) the ACC merging into a super conference. [One of my favorite Georgia Tech Sports Youtubers ""Wreck-Talk"" did a video a couple weeks ago about this possible megaconference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WysHlt79jkc) \- he made some really interesting arguments and moves so I'd highly recommend y'all check him out in case you're interested in what this would look like!

Regardless, I'm definitely worried about the future of collegiate sports - since it seems like everything has become about money these last couple years. And media corporations are willing to destroy historic rivalries between schools, just for the sake of making themselves a few more bucks at the end of the year.

&#x200B;

TLDR:

Best case: SEC/B1G

Worst case: AAC

Currently, my dream schools are Berkeley, CMU, Stanford, Cornell, and Princeton. Although I have Georgia Tech as my back up, I'm looking into other schools as well. As far as I'm aware, there are three important factors - GPA, Research experience, and TA experience. I will have around 3.9x GPA by end of next semester, and I will have 4 semesters of TA experience by the time I graduate (2 semesters of lower division, and 2 semesters of upper division courses). I don't have any research experience, which is my biggest drawback. I've been reaching out to some professors at my school about research opportunities, so hopefully I can participate in a research by upcoming fall.
