More to the point, if you're instituting a moderation policy of ""no hate speech"", could you please define that term?

  To summarize, the resolution is proposing the following things:   
  1. Request the institute leadership to work with the USG to take off the Special Institutional Fee component from the mandatory fees for graduate students.  
  2. Work with various campus partners to take off the burden of athletic fees from all graduate students.  
  3. A holistic review of grad stipends, cost of living, and other factors affecting graduate students before any further increase of mandatory fees.   
   
  This resolution will be voted upon in the upcoming Faculty Senate meeting on October 22nd. While the resolution being passed may not result in reduction in mandatory fees immediately, it will be a concrete step in that direction.   
   
  Help us make more faculty members aware of this:   
  There are currently 200+ faculty signatories to this resolution ([https://gatech.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=301d15fd6b7633d6c7bd5e6eb&amp;id=3fdefe2b4e&amp;e=0063fe551e](https://gatech.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=301d15fd6b7633d6c7bd5e6eb&amp;id=3fdefe2b4e&amp;e=0063fe551e)). Prof. Joshua Weitz, who is leading this effort is hosting an informational townhall for academic faculty on the issue of graduate fees on October 7th at 12pm in IBB 1128 (the Suddath room). This townhall is open only for faculty members due to space constraints.   
   
  What can you do as graduate students?   
  1. Inform your faculty advisors, professors about the resolution and the townhall. You may encourage them to attend it as well.   
  2. Encourage your professors/advisors to email Prof. Joshua Weitz (jsweitz@gatech.edu) to learn more or become a signatory to this resolution.   
   
  We will share more details about SGA's efforts through our next newsletter and other channels of communication. In the meantime, if you have any concerns and/or inputs please feel free to email sga@gatech.edu. We will keep you posted about the developments.

Additionally, the parking map shows the entire structure as available for my parking with no distinction between top or bottom and no indication of meter pay. Nothing in the documents I signed say that either.

THAT NONSENSE ASIDE: one of the parking tickets given to me alleges I parked in a completely different location, w29, more than a hundred meters from where I actually was. They included helpful photos of my car's position a football field away from where they said it was. Obviously I can't be charged for that, right? It didn't happen.

Wrong, the appealed got denied. Allegedly, by a ""jury of my peers"", heavily implied by PTS to me to be fellow students, but I sincerely doubt one of our own would fuck us over like that. Additionally, PTS told me that if my appeal got denied, I would have the option to plead my case to them in person. I see no such option for appeal online. How do I do this? Did they lie to me?

post,"In Memoriam: Vamsi Konjeti. Dear students, faculty and staff,


It is with great sadness that I write today to inform you of the passing of Vamsi Konjeti. a second-year student in Mechanical Engineering from Brentwood, Tennessee.


I met with Vamsi’s family earlier today to express our deepest condolences on behalf of the entire Tech community. The loss of a classmate and fellow member of our community is difficult for all of us, but especially for the students and faculty that knew Vamsi best. 


Counseling services have been offered to Vamsi’s roommates and close friends. Please remember that Georgia Tech offers multiple services and resources in support of the community, and I urge you to take advantage of the counseling services that are available. Grief counseling and mental health support for students is available through the Center for Assessment, Referral and Education (care.gatech.edu) on the first floor of the Smithgall Student Services (Flag) building from 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. throughout the week and after-hours by calling 404-894-2575. Staff and faculty may find support through the Employee Assistance Program at hwb.gatech.edu/eap. 


If you are in need of immediate assistance, you can also contact the Georgia Crisis &amp; Access Line at 1-800-715-4225 which is staffed with professional counselors 24 hours per day, every day, to assist those with urgent and emergency needs. 


Please take care of yourselves and each other and keep Vamsi's family in your thoughts.

post,"A Firsthand Account of What GT Mental Health Services Are Really Like (Long Post). So, this happened to me last year. Some people who know me already know this story and, no, this account is not a throwaway. I figured people should hear my story from me directly. 

I’m a second year at Tech, and right off the bat, my first year started off poorly. A lot of factors were at play, but perhaps the most notable is the fact that I had untreated Depression and Anxiety (and as I’d later find out, OCD and ASD). 


FIRST HOSPITALIZATION:

About a week after my 18th birthday, I set out pills to take with the intention of ending my life. I was so lonely, so hopeless, and overwhelmed in every aspect of my life. However, I started imagining what would happen if I took the pills, panicked, and called the counseling center instead. After telling them what was happening, I was told to come to their office in the flag building. I Ubered there as I was a mess and didn’t want to be seen on the bus. I didn’t pack anything except a favorite ring of mine, and my dad’s jacket that he passed down to me. 

When I got to the counseling center, I’d say it was maybe a 20 minute wait before I was called back into one of the therapists’ offices. A lady took notes as she asked me what was happening, and then she told me what a 10-13 was. Now, for you fortunate folks who *don’t* know, this is when you are involuntarily checked in to a mental health facility for a minimum of 72 hours and must be escorted to said facility (in my case, by GTPD in a squad car). Remember this for later. 

I panicked. I didn’t want my parents to know what had happened. I knew they’d be so upset with me. I begged the therapist not to make me go. I didn’t want to miss class, I felt like I was already behind! I didn’t have any extra clothes or possessions to take with me! 

I didn’t have a choice. I was sent off to Ridgeview in Smyrna, where I stayed for either 4-5 days (to be honest, I’ve tried to repress the memories of my time there so I don’t remember exactly how long it was).

It was awful. The staff as apathetic, we had to turn in everything (including my dad’s jacket and my ring), we couldn’t have any devices (which I somewhat understand, but since music is what calms me down most, this sucked), the group sessions were more traumatic than helpful, the food was awful, and I felt even worse than I had before. I remember on my first night that I was snapped at and sent to sit out in the hall for crying in my bed. 

Finally, I was given a prescription for a low dosage of Prozac and released. When I got back to campus, I had a couple hundred pages of reading, assignments, tests, and more to make up. Though the Dean of Students office was great about helping me arrange makeup work (Dean Riggle deserves tons of praise here), I still knew that missing so much class would hurt me. I don’t learn from reading textbooks. I learn from hearing lectures and demonstrations. 

SECOND HOSPITALIZATION:

It wasn’t long before I noticed that my medication didn’t seem to be working. I fell back into my depressive habits. I wasn’t sleeping, wasn’t eating, couldn’t get myself out of bed, and “those thoughts” started coming back. 

One night, a month after my first hospitalization, I was studying for a big test. I had missed multiple lectures in this class while I was gone and from physically not being able to get myself out of bed to go to class. I realized I felt completely unprepared, panicked, and felt so trapped that I could only see death as a way to get out of the situation. I tried to hang myself, but the attempt failed. 

My roommate heard me crying in my room (apartment style dorm). She didn’t know I had attempted, but she texted me and recommended that I go talk to the Sports Psychologist the next day. I did. With only the clothes on my back and my backpack, I went to their office. Apparently, they had already spoken to my roommate, and knew that I had been upset. They asked if I had been suicidal again. I tried not to panic. I knew what would happen if I told the truth. I’d be shipped away again, I’d get the same terrible treatment, I’d feel even worse again. I refused to answer the question. 

They told me that since they had concern about me hurting myself, I would need to go to a facility. However, I was assured that I could go get evaluated voluntarily and be driven by my coaches instead of the police. I agreed to this. A few minutes later, I’m suddenly told that, no, that’s actually not what’s happening, I’m being 10-13’d again. I ask, “Doesn’t that mean a mandatory 72 hours?” I’m told that no, it doesn’t. Everything is the same, I’ll just have to have the GTPD escort me again. 

I’m hesitant, but I don’t really have a choice. I’m led through the tunnels of Bobby Dodd and put into yet another squad car. This time I’m taken to Peachford in Dunwoody. I wait for about two hours until I’m called back to be evaluated. This is when I find out that I was, in fact, correct. Despite being previously told by Sports Psychology that I would not have to stay 72 hours, Peachford informs me that this is exactly what I will be doing. 

I break down in the evaluation room. I literally felt like I had been taken prisoner. My anxiety attack was so severe that the staff threatened to take me to the stabilization unit if I didn’t calm down. I wasn’t violent. I was scared. Imagine just thinking you’re going on a trip to the doctor and you’re suddenly told that you’re to be locked in an institution and aren’t allowed to leave or have any of your things, including a change of clothes, for days. 

It was like an actual nightmare. Thankfully, Peachford wasn’t quite as bad as Ridgeview. It was still bad, but the staff at least seemed less cruel, and the food was pretty good compared to the Ridgeview prison slop. One of the times that I got to use the pay phone, I called the Sports Psychologist and asked why I’d been given misleading information. I reminded them that I had explicitly asked if a 10-13 would be 72 hours and was told no. They told me that “Well, it’s supposed to be 72 hours, yes, but a doctor *could* release you early.” I asked the doctor about this, and was told that no doctor would ever do that, because a 10-13 was always 72 hours. I felt very lied to and betrayed. 

When I was released again, I decided that maybe some of my stress could be alleviated if I dropped a class. On top of this, I had mandatory therapy and psychiatry appointments. However, on a particularly rough day, I found myself needing counseling when I didn’t have a therapy appointment scheduled. I dropped by the counseling center instead. I was led down the hall of roaring white noise machines (which I personally dislike) and into a therapist’s office. I told her about what had happened, and how I felt overwhelmed with stress again. I was still struggling to sleep, and had been bouncing around on different prescriptions to see what actually worked, which was taking a physical toll. 

She looked at me and shrugged. 
“What do you want *me* to do about it?” 
I stared at her. 
“Pardon?”

I know this is a long post with details that probably nobody cares about. I’ve just been needing to get this off my chest. It wasn’t linear progress for me from there by any means. Lately, things have become overwhelming again, and I often feel very alone. I want to make friends, but feel like I’m more of an annoyance to people than a potential a friend. 

It hurts my heart every time I hear or read that GT loses another student. I know I don’t have all the answers to fixing the glaringly obvious issues surrounding mental health care at Tech, but I can say with absolute certainty that things will never improve if the attitude towards the issue is a shrug and a “What do you want *me* to do about it?” 

Maybe it’s up to us students. We need and deserve for this to be fixed. I’d like to encourage everyone to try to remind someone that they matter in a *personal way.* Also, some of you are already pretty good about this, but I think we should all be more open about talking seriously about our own mental health. I know with the good ol’ Gen Z humor it’s easy to just make memes about having depression, but if we all fight the stigma just a little bit with honest conversation and being willing listeners, I think it could make a world of impact. 

Some mental health days and more student-professor communication about mental health could also potentially do a world of good.

post,"TNR on campus. Hi there! 

I'm a fourth-year LMC who tends to stay on campus late during the week. Because of this, I see plenty of cats on my walk to my car in the wee hours of the morning. 

I've noticed that someone has been feeding these cats at the Student Center parking deck, but none of the cats seem to have ear tips. I was wondering if there are currently any student-led initiatives for TNR-ing this seemingly growing colony? I emailed facilities and they told me to post here to ask.

I have access to traps and a contact at a local nonprofit who does TNR procedures (the whole nine yards -- rabies, FLV, FIV, altering, and chipping if necessary) and I believe some of the kittens are still in that good good age gap to be socialized and adopted. 

So, is anyone already working on this? Can I join in? Or is anyone interested in helping me get this show on the road? I want these cats to live long, happy lives (safe against those rabid foxes and safe against unnecessary breeding!). 

I have included a pic of my personal favorite kitty for attention.

post,"Petition to Reduce Graduate Student Fees.  Dear fellow graduate students,  


The $2,776 in mandatory fees Georgia Tech graduate students will pay this year are the highest among peer universities in the United States \[1\].  This is in part due to the Special Institutional Fee (SIF, currently $1,032 per year), which in 2015 was planned to be reduced until eliminated for graduate students, but has not been reduced since 2017.  These fees are a significant financial burden for graduate students supporting themselves on modest stipends, and are detrimental to the Institute's recruitment of top research talent.  


As a public university, Georgia Tech’s mandatory fees are set by the University System of Georgia Board of Regents based on recommendations from the president of Georgia Tech.  With the new Georgia Tech administration taking office this year, this is an opportune time to make the graduate student voice heard and call for a reduction in mandatory fees. Many faculty members have already voiced their concerns about high mandatory fees, and on October 22 the Faculty Senate will vote on a resolution calling for a reduction in mandatory fees for graduate students \[2\].  Graduate SGA has also been meeting with the Georgia Tech administration to express their concerns.  


However, the most powerful signal that fees need to be reduced should come directly from the graduate students themselves.  Please make your voice heard by signing the petition below, addressed to President Cabrera and his administration. The petition calls for the elimination of the SIF, for mandatory fees used for services not utilized by all graduate students to be made voluntary, and for the Institute to work to reduce other mandatory fees.  


**You can view and sign the petition here:** [**https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_4HlWV94I0G1G05v**](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4HlWV94I0G1G05v)  


**Please forward this message to your colleagues, and help us distribute the petition to as many graduate students as you can.  Our goal is for as many graduate students as possible to sign the petition by the Faculty Senate meeting on October 22.**

##Wiki FAQs

---

###Where can I find the wiki?
The wiki can be found at the following link: https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/wiki/ or at the WIKI link in the subreddit header on desktop.

###How can I contribute to the wiki?

We wrote a [contribution guide here](https://old.reddit.com/r/gatech/wiki/index#wiki_contributing_to_the_wiki). We think that captures most of the details, but to reiterate, your account must have at least 250 karma on this subreddit, and be at least a year old. We are trying to have this capture active, positively contributing members of the sub but if this is too restrictive we can loosen these fairly easily.

Most of the sections has a template, if you are confused, please reach out to the mods.

###How do I make a new page?

Follow the link guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/wiki/wiki

For example, to make a new club page, your link is going to be as follows:

https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/wiki/campus_life/clubs/CLUB_NAME_HERE

###I can make a page on anything?

We ask that you stick to the outlined categories, and make your pages as factual as possible. IE list professor contact info and GPAs, not ""Professor X sucks""

###I see a question a lot that's not on the FAQ, can I add it?

You can add anything! We want this to be community run. 

###How directly related to GT does my page have to be?

If it relates to something that will affect an average run of the mill GT student, it belongs here. Please keep opinions to a minimum, unless it's related to food.

Pages that would be allowed:

* Recommended KBBQ restaurants ITP
* Where to get macbook repairs
* Bird Laws (the scooters)

Not allowed:

* GA Politics (How to register to vote is fine, political opinions, not fine)
* Advertisements for a business without explicit mod approval
* Why you should pick GT over X university
* Why X professor is bad

If you're on the fence, message the modmail.

###I don't like what X page says

If it breaks the rules, message the mods. If not, do not vandalize the page, and message us anyway to review it. Vandalism will result in a subreddit ban, and we have methods to roll back vandalism anyway.

post,"Studying space etiquette?. The other day I was studying at willage by myself and managed to snag a table at the plywood booths. The table next to mine was occupied by a group of three people. Eventually one of their other friends stopped by their table, eventually sitting in the chair across from me and proceeded to socialize with them/ do work for the next two hours.

It really messed with my ability to focus, but I didn't want to move because there weren't really other tables to move to. It also felt a little like they wanted me to move so they could use both tables, and eventually I did move even though my lizard brain really wanted me to stand my ground since I had been there first. Would it have been reasonable to call them out? I've never had this happen before and was curious to know if there's a commonly accepted way to deal with it.

Edit: I guess I wasn't really asking about study space specific behavior so much as generally respecting each other's space around campus. Willage has been really crowded lately, so if you're trying to hang out with your friends finding space might be difficult, but I feel like it's reasonable to at least ask if it's ok to use someone else's table.",Negative,Space etiquette and respecting personal space in a crowded environment.,3,2019-10-09

post,"Feeling low and need someone to talk to? I'm down!. Hey everyone --- I'm new to Tech and have noticed how rough it is to get support here when you're feeling low. At my old school, we used to have a program where people could walk-in and chat with a fellow student who was ready to support them if they were feeling low/validate them/be a place to vent. In the absence of something like that here (afaik), I'm down to do it.

Of course, the usual disclaimers, I'm just a normal dude and have no training in counseling or anything formal. But I like to listen and I want to be here for you if you're having a rough time (just as I've had). **I'll be sitting at a table in the Georgia Tech Student Center in the middle of the food court from 3-6 tomorrow. Feel free to come by if you're feeling low or just want some company or someone to talk/vent to. I'll be wearing a bright pink shirt and bright blue pants so I'm easy to see.** And tbh if no one comes, I'll just be hanging out and studying, so I'm happy to also just keep you company as we both meander through reading responses and code and formulas and literature reviews.

I know well how overwhelming it can be to cope with school, mental health stuff, and everything else in our lives (particularly when you've recently changed environments or are in a new situation). It hurts my heart to think of all the people potentially turned away from CARE/counseling and the kinds of really awful experiences people have had with counseling services here at Tech. I'm inspired by how passionate I've seen the students here are about mental health, and I hope that we can have a future here someday in which you can get access to a therapist and a psychiatrist and anything else you might need to be able to feel okay without so much stress and added (unnecessary) effort.

I originally thought that this means 6 hours of free electives are required. This then means that, with my two threads that both show ""(6 hours)"", I need 12 thread-specific free elective hours. My advisor has also mentioned/glossed over this requirement.

Except I don't see these on DegreeWorks (DegreeAudit?). DegreeWorks just has my remaining required thread picks, core reqs, and ""BSCS - Electives"" section which I assume corresponds to major electives, not thread electives. If I sum up my remaining courses and include the 12 aforementioned hours of thread-specific ""Free Electives"", I'm 12 hours over the major requirement of 126, which sucks--I don't want to deal with an extra semester's worth of work.

Now that I'm halfway through my second semester I feel like I've lost all my drive and I'm just a below average student who shouldn't even be here. I'm taking 4 classes and doing fine in three of them, but I got a 40 my first calculus test a few weeks ago and I feel like such an idiot. I understood the concepts, I just was too anxious to study. I don't even know how to study, because I've never taken a hard class before. I don't know what to do, I don't have any self-discipline left because I'm always exhausted and I've skipped class many times. I need some kind of structure to follow, but I know I'm an adult now who's expected to be able to take care of myself. I keep slipping into depression and wanting to give up. I feel like this situation isn't uncommon for students but I still feel so alone when everyone around me seems to already be so skilled at working hard studying and resisting distractions. I'm so disappointed that I went from the top of my class in my tiny high school to someone who's struggling to manage with only 12 credit hours. I went to the counseling center and they told me to leave and go find help somewhere else. I don't know where else to go. Was anyone else in a similar situation freshman year? What did you do? I don't want to sound so dramatic over one bad test, by feel like I'm already so deep in mediocrity it's impossible to improve myself. I really don't want to give up though, I love computer science and I'm proud to be a tech student. Where can I find help? What can I do?

post,"The myth called achievement. A significant percentage of the students at this school are truly struggling. It's not new and I'm glad people now feel safe enough to reach out to the community about it. I want to help, and this might be a message you **need** to hear.

If you're reading this as a fellow student, there's a good chance you've got a million things occupying your head at this very moment. Enough things to cloud judgement and distort thought. I'm asking you take a break from inside your head and zoom out to view your life from above.

What you might see is that you look like a point on a plane of the cartesian persuasion, located at what we call the present moment. It's got an infinite number of bumpy paths extending in all directions. Like... really bumpy--keep your arms and legs in the car at all times.

Every hill is a high in your life. Every valley is a low.

At our altitude, these might look small (not necessarily--I'm not trying to make light of tragedy). That embarrassing thing you did last week? Approximately every person except you forgot about it not even 10 seconds following. Got a job offer? You are a MF'ing G (I cannot emphasize this more, getting employed is the reason you *willingly* came to Tech!!). Same thing, though.

If you're like me, you have at *least* a few crippling insecurities. Times I've failed to perform. Making below average grades in my classes. Bombed every single one of my two phone screens this semester. I'm extremely into that girl, better play it cool and pretend like she doesn't exist (works every\* time). Is there a job ~~beyond retail~~ I'm... actually qualified for?

If you're like me, you probably want to change too. We all have an ideal image of ourselves we can visualize. Mine goes to sleep every night at a reasonable time, excited for the next day. Puts forth his best effort, in all things, irrespective of his emotional state. Has a 10.75 inch jimmy john... You get what I'm saying.

Let's call this ideal version of yourself Big-Dick-Energy-Chad-You (BDECY).

Why in the world do we all feel so rushed to reach this ideal? BDECY is mostly achievable. Look, I know 'Biggest-Dick-Icarus' (BDI) did it in 2 years while volunteering in Africa, but what does that have to do with you? It's possible you're a late bloomer and it'll be another 5 years? 10 years? 20? Who knows and who cares. It's entirely possible BDI had a helping hand, arm, *and* leg, or maybe not; It truly does not matter.

So your work hasn't impacted the lives of strangers yet. So not everyone likes you. So you've got noticeable flaws. So you've fallen way (waaaaaaaay) short of where you thought you'd be at this point in your life.

So... wait, why do we care about these things again?

If you're like me, your younger, ignorant self, often lauded as a (future) world-impactor, set up some self-expectations that don't make a whole lot of sense under closer scrutiny. 

**You've put all your self-worth eggs in the achievement basket.**

The truth is, it's an anomaly to drive up a steep mountain in the plane of reality and make it to the top without falling off and sustaining major trauma. Besides, once your altitude gets high, you have no choice but to keep moving up. *To stop is to fall all the way back down*. BDI is the one who's actually out of place. He will have to bust ass for the rest of his life just to *maintain* his position.

I'm going to challenge you to stop looking at paths leading up mountains and aim for something flatter. Look for a wide path rising slowly and steadily. Give yourself permission to fuck up. And be there to support yourself when it inevitably happens.

Don't totally let go of BDECY, but rather realize you may never reach that ideal, nor should you feel pressured to. Realize that BDI is exposing himself to a *dangerous* way of life. A way of life taking him to a summit, alone. **Any path that puts you above everyone else, by definition, leaves you there on your own.**

Now zoom back into the close view of your life. Take stock of your surroundings. Stop looking directly down or directly up. Instead look at the horizon and find a gentle slope leading up, but advance slowly, deliberately. You've got plenty of time to gain momentum before hitting the gas.

Determine your success, not based off of where you are, but based off of any small thing you did this day/week/month/year that moved you ever so slightly towards your ideal self. **Something that's trivial to everyone else might be huge for you.** And give yourself a pat on the back. You've made it this far.

**tl;dr: Stop focusing on who you think you should have been by now. Instead, pay attention to whether or not you're moving in a positive direction. Achievement is not a sustainable source of self-worth. When you let go of the need to be special, it will free you.**",Positive,Self-improvement and self-worth.,161,2019-10-15

So, I always considered myself more of a liberal arts kind of guy... history, politics, etc. I was going to attend UVA and major in PoliSci before deciding on Tech. I’m a Bio major right now, and I entered Tech hoping to focus on genetics. However, I don’t particularly like my genetics lecture (the lab is awesome, though), and I’m not loving chemistry either. I’m not doing well in either class, and I can’t imagine continuing to take two labs every single semester I’m at Tech because it’s already a lot. If I stick to Bio, it’ll get even harder when I start taking computing, math, and more advanced chemistry as well. The test I took yesterday to determine my strengths had all five of my top strengths being soft people skills. I have a couple of friends in INTA, and one friend in IAML specifically. I’m seriously considering switching majors to IAML with a focus on probably Spanish. Should I switch now? Should I switch after my second semester if things don’t change? How set back would I be with either? I’m meeting with my advisor next week, so I’ll speak about this then as well, but if anyone has any advice on switching majors, or has experience in the IAML major, I’d love to hear from you.","Neutral

I play and sing at the piano frequently because I live on West and love to express myself through music, and I get mixed opinions from the people there.  Lots of times I’ll finish a song and people will clap, or someone will approach me and say something very nice and encouraging.  On the other hand, people have asked me to play quieter and have asked me to completely stop playing, to which I usually do.  Once I was even asked by someone if “we needed to take this outside” and someone else once told me that my playing was the reason he got nothing done for the past hour (which I don’t understand; if it’s that seriously distracting you then why haven’t you just left).  I have had lots of positive experiences though where someone will approach me and we’ll have a good conversation, and I’ve had people ask “Hey, you play piano at Willage right?” when I’m on the opposite side of campus, and those interactions are positive.

Overall, I’ve gotten the full spectrum of reactions from people.  I’ve always assumed that time and other factors affect how people feel, but I was just playing today, on a Saturday, from around 4-5 and had three people ask me to “play quieter because people are trying to study” and three people say something similar to “you sound amazing, please keep playing.”  So I ask the people of reddit, what are your opinions on the piano at West Village?

post,"Feeling overwhelmed yet? Yeah you are. I got you.. Hey it's me, the programmer (GT CompE '18) who's basically become the human version of the ""I'm something of a scientist myself"" meme. At the start of the semester I wrote a post giving my tips to help people do better in college by not making the same mistakes I did. That went over pretty well, so I'm back with more unrequested advice.

[Here's this post in video form. Shameful plug.](https://youtu.be/4BQPFuXygFc) More shameful than being an Orlando City FC fan. Take a break from watching your Spongebob hentai fanfic and watch it. Or just read this post.

So back when I was a student at our beloved Institute, I constantly had an issue where I would **know** that I needed to study, and even kind of **wanted** to study, but I felt a weird fear/discomfort about actually doing it, so I'd put it off. Ever get that?

This happens because when we get overwhelmed, our cortisol (stress hormone) spikes, our serotonin (feel-good / feel-safe neurotransmitter) drops, and we start feeling anxious. Then, the amygdala in our brain's stupid (like ugag waterboy stupid) limbic system makes us afraid of what made us stressed out. This is why we become afraid of the homework. Or watching our football team play against anyone but themselves. So you're overwhelmed and you're hurtling towards failing ECE2026 because you spend too many ""study sessions"" at Cookout. What do you do?

1) Start taking better care of yourself. We have a lot of stuff to think about and it's easy to get caught up in putting everything else first, but if you don't keep up with your own wellbeing, you won't be able to effectively handle much else. You know why everyone says grad students are basically zombies? That's why. My favorite things to do are meditate a few minutes a day (just sit, close your eyes, and breathe. that's it), go sit out by the fountain in front of my office, and send S-tier surrealmemes to my old roommates.

2) Make a list of everything on your mind. All the homework, projects, exams, cute people's numbers, and the memes you really want to post in **that** Facebook group. Write it all down so you can start clearing your mind and processing it. Doing this will make you think about things in a different way, which may just help you have a bit of an aha moment and improve things.

3) Talk to someone. I cannot overstate how incredibly helpful it can be to just talk something out with someone. It can be hard sometimes (especially if you don't have someone nearby who you're on that level with), but please try to find someone if you think you need to. Like the last tip, talking about something makes you think about and process things differently, so you'll gain a new perspective and maybe figure something out without any input needed from the other person (aside from nodding occasionally / showing signs of life). 

**If you're feeling really bad, please talk to someone about it. I know it can be scary, but it could be a big help. You can privately message me if you'd like to - I'm here for you.**

The most requested initiative quickly became clear: working on improvements to the Housing Maintenance Request System. The first step towards this is collecting information regarding your experiences as a resident with the Housing Maintenance Request System.

We're planning on sending out more information later this week via email regarding Residential Advocacy; however, due to the maintenance issues we've seen reported online over the past week, we decided to go ahead and send out the following form to our friends in the Reddit community. Please see below for more information:

**\[RHA Res Adv #1\] Housing Maintenance Request System Feedback Form:** [**https://forms.gle/J4RcoVQxVnc126YM7**](https://forms.gle/J4RcoVQxVnc126YM7)

RHA is collecting information on the current systemic issues with the Housing Maintenance Request System. In the form linked above, you'll find general questions regarding the maintenance system, space to provide general feedback, and even a section dedicated to explaining specific situations that you've encountered with the maintenance system.

DISCLAIMER: Due to the amount of responses we're anticipating, we will not be able to respond to individual submissions. This form is being used to collect data to support updates to the Housing Maintenance Request System, and we cannot personally fix any ongoing issues with your rooms; however, if you are experiencing issues currently, please contact: [facilities@housing.gatech.edu](mailto:facilities@housing.gatech.edu).

If you have any other ideas for residential initiatives, let us know here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdb3zLjVCbAY5e1AcPJeU-Qzuu1Q7lnCTXoTMNkwROz6GsjRQ/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdb3zLjVCbAY5e1AcPJeU-Qzuu1Q7lnCTXoTMNkwROz6GsjRQ/viewform) 

If you'd like to provide confidential, anonymous feedback regarding anything RHA or Housing-related, let us know here:  [https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_0OjwA6v3Ad1RjBH](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0OjwA6v3Ad1RjBH) 

If you have any other specific questions or feedback in the meantime, feel free to email [advocacy@rha.gatech.edu](mailto:advocacy@rha.gatech.edu) or [president@rha.gatech.edu](mailto:president@rha.gatech.edu).

post,"ME 2110 is Crushing My Soul. This is just me venting honestly to whoever is bored and wants to read. 

I heard all sorts of things about this course before I registered for it. I heard it was one of the most time-consuming courses that a ME will take in their undergraduate curriculum. I see that those people were not kidding. 

I've never had yet to pull multiple all-nighters for a class; I typically just never allow myself to begin to get in that sort of situation. Usually the ME 2110 teams are teams of 4. I'm in a team of 3, and having 25% less manpower is showing itself in ugly ways. 

I can't focus in my other classes. I feel like I'm not even learning what is being lectured in my other courses. Because the constant, overbearing pressure of ME 2110 looms over us and any time I make plans to study and really LEARN (which is what I thought was the point of higher education), the mindless busywork of 2110 kicks in like clockwork. 

People say ME 2110 prepares you for the real world where you have to work with teams to meet deadlines. I've co-oped and I'm ex military and from my experience, nothing I'm doing in 2110 feels like it's preparing me directly for employment. Its just taxing my resources (time, money, sanity) and teaching me nothing except for like 4 design tools that industries use. 

I'm so tired. I am so frustrated. I just want this to be over so I can get back to learning again and having time to do simple, personal things that I used to do. I know this is a hard school, I'm not complaining about the difficulty. Its just from my frame of reference, my frustrations need to be let out in the form of words. 

Thank you for reading if you ever take this course, for the love of God, please please don't take more courses than you have to with it.

Why don't we create a GT chapter of emergency medical services (like other schools) where there's always a student on shift to provide to help those students? We can start off with helping GTPD during school events and such.

The section of the Path Parkway bike/walk trail between the CRC and West Midtown has a couple of streetlights out, making the walk almost pitch black dark in the early mornings and late evenings since the route is pretty well shaded and goes under a bridge. I think this is pretty dangerous; this route receives a lot of traffic b/c a lot of GT folks live in West Midtown, but the walk is pretty sketchy due to the pitch black, and is also a physical hazard since cyclists can't see pedestrians (when I ride my bike there, I can barely see 5 feet in front of me). 

Who do I contact? I'm not sure if this is GT's jurisdiction since it's so close to the CRC, Atlanta's jurisdiction, or perhaps the Path Parkway organization's. With the daylight savings shift coming up, it'll start getting dark at like 5pm, so I want to get these streetlights back up as soon as possible.

post,"kindness around us.  I’m sitting here with a bunch of crap due and I don’t know, I just felt like writing this because I feel like some people need to read it. 

School, and just life in general is hard. You wake up some days and are like goddamn I cannot believe I have to keep going. Small things happen here and there that just make it worse. Like it’ll be absolutely pouring and you miss the bus. Or you just randomly start coughing and then all of the sudden you have a disease that will probably fuck you over for the semester. Or you submit at 11:59 when the deadline was 11:55. Or they get your order wrong at student center and you’re vegetarian so you accidentally consume meat and then puke.

There are also different things that may stem from this build up of awfulness inside you. You may see people that are happy around you and think, “Wow, they must really have great things going on! They’re not dealing with all of the shit I am”. And as a 4th year who has finally grown up a little bit, I just want to say - you don’t *know.* Nobody knows anything about anybody else they don’t even know - and sometimes even about the people they do know. Nobody knows how hard it can be for some people to just feel the motivation and drive to keep going, and nobody knows how much someone might be going through. Nobody knows about anybody else’s family, or health issues, or other issues. That person you have been sitting next to in recitation for the past few weeks might always seem cheery during that hour you see them, but who knows what they may even have going on for the rest of the 166 hours of the week?

I just want people to know that the smallest things in the world can genuinely make a difference. I was on the trolley a few weeks ago and this guy was struggling to carry his groceries, and someone sitting down offered him his seat. And all I could think was, “Wow that was so nice of him!” But like, isn’t that just human decency? If we see people struggling, don’t we just want to help them? The only reason any of us wake up every day is to keep going in life and make sure that the next day is worth living - and sometimes, if it seems like everything around you is completely ass, a kind stranger just saying “hi” or moving their stuff over for you when you sit down in a crammed location in the CULC can genuinely change things.

I was sick a few days ago and went to Stamps; I saw this poor freshman who had vomited being stressed about skipping class. I’m just like ugh you poor thing. You are out of state, away from your family, early in your first semester at GT, stressed about failing, and you just PUKED, but you’re more concerned with missing class? Like, this is how the rules work - a kid feels like she cannot take an hour to go see a doctor? I’m sure she had to get past the lady at the front who definitely said “We release new appointments every morning at 8 AM” . Because that’s definitely what she needed. To hear that she missed all appointments she could have made. 

After I waited 3 hours to see a PA - since I hadn’t made an appointment and did not know I would be puking in advance that day - the PA does that really stupid bitchy thing that some people do. That thing where you are trying to confide in someone, and tell them what you are feeling and what’s wrong, and then they have the nerve to give you a look with wide eyes and be like “yeah?” I don’t get it. Nobody NEEDS it. 

I sent my professor an email letting him know that I had been suffering this week with an illness, just in case it would get worse. I have a test coming up in this class next week, and I should be fine by then, but I just wanted to update him. It has been a rough semester, where random health related things have happened and I have asked for an extension a few times. This time, I just update him because I believe in open communication; I get back an email thats like yelling at me, pretty much telling me to stop making excuses - even though I have had medical notes each time. Did I really need to hear my professor yelling at me when I’m sick and worried about failing every class already?

My friend had all of his shit stolen from his truck - like his laptop, and his tablet, and his notes - which are like your life at GT. And when I call my apartment complex and tell them about this just to get some surveillance, they go “ oh so he left his stuff in his car? “ I’m like “Yeah, it sucks.” I know it’s typically like a common rule to not leave your shit in the car, but at that moment, did I really have to hear “Oh, thats why”? Yes. I get it. Next time, he won’t do that. But do you really have to just put him in his place? Why are people so concerned with having the upper hand all the fucking time and why do they have to be like “Oh, that’s why” or “I told you so”. None of us NEED this.

I get that people don’t have time for other people’s shit. I get that in the one moment I talked to the PA when she was rude, that she might have just been having a bad day. I get that the front desk person at my apartment complex probably had a really bad day and might hate her job too and doesn’t have time for people’s shit. What I don’t get is: why is this what you get everywhere you go on a college campus? We see students suffering from depression. We get horrible emails about suicide. We see people crying in bathrooms sometimes too. Am I saying that the examples I listed are the main direct causes? No. But they’re certainly not helping anybody. 

This entire rant might not mean anything to anybody, but I just felt like putting this out there: next time you have the choice to be absolutely rude for no reason, or just be decent and not bitchy - picking the latter really helps the rest of the world.",Positive,Kindness and empathy towards others and the impact it can have on someone's life.,89,2019-10-25

post,"Anyone else meet a Dhaval Patel on campus? I get the feeling he might be a conman. So, earlier last week I was out for a walk when a person walking by noticed my phone and began a conversation with me. The man introduced himself as someone who was running a small speaker event at tech for business students and asked for my contact info to further discuss a potential opportunity. I, internship hungry/desperate, decided to give it a shot.

Come this morning, I'm supposed to meet him and I wake up half an hour late. I call him and apologize and he says make it over to culc anyways. First alarm bell. But I still get dressed and head there and start talking to him. He begins talking about networks and how we make these social networks and yet don't get compensated  for them. HE follows up by talking about how this school teaches you to take a safe career and work a good paying job but you'd be working for someone else. He then asks me to imagine what I would  do in 5 years if I made 100k and had the time to do whatever I wanted. Second alarm bell, this is beginning to sound like a crappy internet scam right? Well, during the course of the conversation he brings up that he wants my parents in the loop because this being an entrepreneurial opportunity and all, there might be some licensing costs or whatnot.

I have an unconditional love for reptiles and recently began thinking about trying to start up a club that focuses on the reptile keeping hobby, e.g. personal pets/experiences, advice, equipment, DIY solutions, husbandry, and rare species/genetics breeding.

As a second year student, this being my first at tech, I don't know where to begin, and reptiles being such a niche interest doesn't make it any easier.

post,"Georgia Tech can still win the ACC Coastal. Here's how. It's been a season to forget for the Jackets - 2-5 with losses to schools like Temple and The Citadel don't inspire confidence among the fanbase, but hey, it's Geoff Collins's first year, he beat Miami on the road, yadda yadda, maybe it's time for some optimism. Let's talk playoffs.

That's right - Tech is *still* in contention for the ACC Coastal title. Crazy, right? They have just ONE ACC win! Seems impossible, no? Wrong. Tech has a path to Charlotte, and while it's plenty improbable, it's certainly possible.

Here's a quick look at the current ACC Coastal standings:

UVA - 3-2

UNC - 3-2

VT - 2-2

Pitt - 2-2

Duke - 2-3

Miami - 2-3

GT - 1-3

Let's get Tech atop the standings, shall we? Here's what needs to happen.

# 1. Tech wins out.

This is the obvious thing that needs to happen. Every team ahead of Tech has 2 losses except for Miami and Duke - if Tech loses one more game, you need to count on all four of those teams losing *two* more games across the rest of ACC play.

But Tech is in the position where it plays most of the top teams in the Coastal these last few weeks of the season - Tech plays Pitt, UVA, VT, and N.C. State. If Tech wins all of those games, they not only finish 5-3 in the ACC, they also knock Pitt, UVA, and VT down to three-loss territory *and* they hold the tiebreaker over them, so at best, none of those teams could finish better than Tech.

Is this feasible? Hell no. Even if Tech shows up like they did against the Miami game and their opponents play like Miami, the median outcome for the rest of the season is likely one win. But there's optimism that Tech could finally be finding a rhythm, and Coastal Chaos always favors the underdog.

# 2. Duke must lose once

This is actually the most likely part of the plan. Duke isn't looking too hot, sitting at 2-3, but if *they* win out, they'll also be a 5-3 team and they'll hold the tiebreaker over Tech by virtue of beating the Jackets earlier this season. Duke plays Syracuse, ranked Wake Forest, and Miami for the rest of the season, so odds favor this outcome, but nothing is for granted.

# 3. UNC must lose twice

UNC is in a similar boat as Duke - they beat Tech so they hold a potential tiebreaker over Tech. The bad part? UNC has just TWO losses, so they can afford to lose a game and still come away with the Coastal title. In order for UNC to gain two more losses and remove them from a tiebreaker scenario with GT, UNC must lose two games from a slate of Virginia, Pittsburg, and NC State. It's certainly feasible that UNC loses to Virginia and Pitt - but still slim odds.

***

If all of this happens, then there will be likely multiple three loss teams, but GT will hold the tiebreaker over all of them, and thus, reign supreme as the kings of Coastal Chaos.

When does this scenario fall apart?

* If Tech loses to Pitt, and Pitt wins any of their remaining games against UNC, VT, or Boston College, then Tech will have at best 4 losses and Pitt will have at worst 4 losses but hold the tiebreaker over Tech - Tech eliminated.
* If Tech beats Pitt and loses to UVA, Tech will finish with at best 4 losses and UVA will finish with at worst 4 losses, but hold the tiebreaker over GT - Tech eliminated.
* If Tech beats Pitt and UVA and loses to VT, and if VT beat Wake Forest the game before, Tech will finish with at best 4 losses and VT will finish with at worst 4 losses, but will hold the tiebreaker over GT - Tech eliminated. If VT did not beat Wake Forest the game before, they only need one more win against UVA or Pitt to eliminate VT.
* If Tech beats Pitt, UVA, and VT and then loses to N.C. State, then Tech will finish with at best 4 losses. If any of Pitt, UVA, VT did not lose a remaining ACC game outside of GT, they will finish with at worst 3 losses - Tech eliminated.
* If UNC does not lose twice, they finish with at worst 3 losses and Tech finishes with at best 3 losses, but UNC holds the tiebreaker over Tech - Tech eliminated.
* If Duke does not lose, they finish with at worst 3 losses and Tech finishes with at best 3 losses, but Duke holds the tiebreaker over Tech - Tech eliminated.

If Tech wins out in the ACC and Duke/UNC don't do what they're supposed to, don't cry - Tech reaches bowl eligibility! Still, a long ways off in the distance.

If you're interested in practical ways to be more satisfied and happy or if you're interested in philosophy and the social sciences, I think you'll find this course interesting.

**Special Topics - Happiness**

(It may be listed as just Special Topics in some places)

BMED 2803

* Section A (41341) 11:15 - 12:05 MWF - Kendeda 210

Open to **all majors**.

Some of the **practical** stuff in the course:

1. How to sustainably increase happiness
2. Cope with stress and disappointment
3. Make better predictions about future happiness
4. How people succeed or fail to find meaning in life
5. Work effectively with others
6. Appreciate cultural differences in the definition of a good life
7. Manage worry and self-deprecation

The more **theoretical** stuff in the course covers sociology, economics, and philosophy. It includes topics like the association between income and happiness, the impact of income inequality of Americans' happiness, changing definitions of happiness across history, and the difference between happiness and a good life.

Here are some **reviews** from previous students:

* ""This was one of the most rewarding classes in terms of personal growth and understanding I have taken at my time at Georgia Tech...This course was a major factor in the growth this semester.”
* “Dr. Martin was one of the most knowledgeable and passionate professors I’ve had!”
* ""Very useful - we learned about different theories and the history of happiness, but more importantly, I took away a lot of practical ways to improve my happiness.""
* ""I think I have done a better job of getting closer to the person I would like to be because I had the opportunity to look at myself introspectively.""
* ""I never knew how valuable it is to regularly talk about happiness and just keep it at the forefront of your mind.""","Positive

I was told by several different people that I should try to use CPT as it’d be good to have all of OPT left when I graduate in 2022. The thing is I did a lot of research and I’m still confused af on how they work especially here at Tech.

First of all, is it actually true that I should go for CPT? I read that the internship would need to count towards my degree, so I should register it through C2D2. But what does that even mean?? So do I get credit counted as electives or something? Does that imply I couldn’t get paid? Also, about the whole process: do I just apply to companies and then after I get an offer I apply for CPT at Tech? Is that how it works?

Another thing: I was told that the companies wouldn’t need to sponsor me since I’m a sophomore and it would be just an internship with extremely low chances of them offering me a full job after I graduate. Is that true? If anyone can answer any of the questions that’d be great! Also any advice you have on what I should do (like CPT or OPT) would be greatly appreciated... thanks!!

post,"Mold/Mildew/Environmental Growth. Regardless of what GT Housing decides to call it year after year, the mold problem prevalent in GT dorms is a problem. I'm currently a 3rd year who is a Peer Leader on campus, and both last year and this year (both times PLing) I have had mold in my room, on my bed, and on my belongings. I've been sick for the past month and a half and have been struggling in classes because of it. At such a prestigious school, where I work two jobs and am a full time student (so I have absolutely no time to be sick), you'd think Tech would put a little more emphasis on taking care of our health so we can perform well. But alas, their solution is what? Change the name from ""mildew"" to ""environmental growth"" and sweep the problem under the rug yet again.

I'm tired of housing treating their employees poorly.

We are working on course matching now but the final exam/matrix is quite confusing. It would be great if someone can help to explain to us how it works (or link a document).

Here are some questions

* If the same module has multiple sessions, each with different exam date on the matrix, does it mean that this module has different groups of people sitting for the same paper at different dates and times?
* How do I tell which module has/doesn't have an exam? e.g. ECE 2045 doesn't have exam while ECE 2035 have even though both are quite similar(?) in nature. The course catalogue doesn't always explicitly state whether the module has a final and how the weights are like for the assessments.

Dear students, faculty and staff,

Last night we learned of the death of Minh “Harry” Hoang, a graduate student in the School of Mechanical Engineering from Vietnam. Harry received his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Georgia Tech in the spring of 2018 and immediately started in the graduate program that following fall.

We at Georgia Tech offer our deepest condolences to Harry’s family and friends who are coping with the shock and grief resulting from this heartbreaking news. I’ve been in contact with Harry’s family and will continue to support them on behalf of Georgia Tech.

As we grieve the loss of this promising young student and cope with the sadness we feel, I want to encourage you to take care of yourselves and each other. Please remember that Georgia Tech offers multiple services and resources in support of the community, and I urge you to take advantage of the mental health services that are available.

Grief counseling and mental health support for students is available through the Center for Assessment, Referral and Education ([care.gatech.edu](http://care.gatech.edu/)) on the first floor of the Smithgall Student Services (Flag) building. Staff and faculty may find support through the Employee Assistance Program at [hwb.gatech.edu/eap](http://hwb.gatech.edu/eap).

If you are in need of immediate assistance, you can also contact the Georgia Crisis &amp; Access Line at 1-800-715-4225 or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.  Both of these programs are staffed with professional counselors 24 hours per day, every day, to assist those with urgent and emergency needs.

Finally, you can always reach out to my office, the Office of the Vice President and Dean of Students. We are available to meet and support students with any mental health or academic concerns, and we can connect students directly to campus resources ([studentlife.gatech.edu](http://studentlife.gatech.edu/)). My office also has a referral option if you are concerned about a student or yourself ([referral.gatech.edu](https://referral.studentlife.gatech.edu/)).",Neutral,Condolences and mental health resources for the loss of a graduate student.,131,2019-10-30

With little modding (*if this isn't already integrated but they aren't telling us*) they could add **facial recognition tracking**.

The camera network will be able to log the precise time and location a vehicle was spotted *(as their police cruisers already do, those are the camera looking things on the back of their cars)*, how long before they map every face to a time and location on campus?

You know what's scarier than finals?  
Reusing passwords, that's no fun…  
This makes it easy for hacker bums.  
Here at cyber we want to relay,  
Some password tips to keep the spooks away!

\- Use a password manager application. You only need to remember one password and the application will create unique, complex and long passwords for every website.  
\- Never use the same password on multiple sites, a password manager will help you with this!  
\- Avoid passwords based on a dictionary word or something about you. A password manager will ALSO help you with this, awesome!  
\- Enable multi-factor authentication on any site that has it available.

Contractors for the Price Gilbert portion of Library Next are planning to test the smoke evacuation system on Friday, Nov. 1 and Friday, Nov. 8. There will be signage placed in the area. 

* In **Crosland Tower**, we will experience fan noise, air movement, open doors and no HVAC on the Grove Level and first floor.
* In **Clough Commons**, there may be some noise. 

The issues will be intermittent, and will not last the full eight-hour test period.

post,"Help me decide between two options (Computer Science). Let me begin by saying that my only goal is to maximize the amount of money I can make in the least amount of time.

I am currently a Computer Science freshman at Ga State and I originally intended to transfer to Ga Tech after one year and finish my Bachelors at Ga Tech 2023.

However after speaking with my current adviser she brought up the fact that with my 27 AP credits that I could graduate from Ga State a year earlier (2022) with a Bachelors in CS as well as a Minor in Mathematics (I would only need to take two more level 3000 classes to get it) and then pursue a MS CS at Ga Tech either through on campus or the Online version which would take roughly 1-1.5 years.

So then is a MS from Tech and a BS from State + Math Minor better than transferring to Tech straight up if both could be done in the same amount of time (4 years) and are their any potential factors that I may have missed ?",Neutral,Decision-making between two options (Computer Science),0,2019-10-31

post,"The Dalai Lama, when asked what surprised him most about humanity, answered.... ""Man! Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.”

The people at Tech are **wonderful**. The culture at Tech is **garbage**. When are we going to stop pushing the narrative that intentionally sacrificing everything that's important in life is virtuous?

When I tell you to stop punishing yourself for not living up to certain standards, that *does not mean you should settle for mediocrity.* It means to forget what others have conditioned you to believe is important and instead focus on what **you** believe is important. That is what it means to care for your own wellbeing. Picking up the pieces of your psyche does not get easier after graduation (on the contrary), take it from my first hand experience.

Hot take/side note: The people who graduated decades back had it ""harder"" because they were weaker students. I *feel* my ineptitude compared to the students today only 5 years my junior. You all are incredible. And demanding more humane treatment is a sign of progress, not regression.
