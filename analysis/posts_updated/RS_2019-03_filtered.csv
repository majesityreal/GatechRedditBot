post,"Wreck Techs Interview. So I was somehow picked for an interview with Wreck Techs and was wondering if anyone had any advice on a general idea of what I should know going into it. I've followed some of the links they've sent me and looked over some general information, but I don't know how technical the interview gets and I doubt my skills enough to come asking for help/advice. 

Thanks in advance!",Neutral,Interview preparation and seeking advice.,9,2019-02-28
