comment,"Bit vague on detail and what you wanna accomplish here, but here's my take:

Ask the TAs for help if there is a chance of a C or B at all and you think there is a way for you to get there. There are also peer tutors and others who can help you. The best thing you can do is attend all the office hours you can; literally, some of the office hours before classes can be ghost towns unless its the day of the exam or the hw. Go earlier than the rest of the crowd, like a week earlier, for help. Heck, just hang out there and do HW, if you don't have any particular questions. Just being there can allow the TAs to give you encouragement and help.

If you think you can't get a B or a C, and you want advice if you should drop the course with a W, the TAs can't legally help you (or at least should refer you). Instead go to the professor for his advice and to your academic adviser for help on what to do while still graduating on time.

If you feel you are too stressed about the class, relax. You got the rest of your life ahead of you, you're not going to base your life on one class.

If the stress is getting to you, do something about it.  Maybe you need to pull out for a while to gain perspective.  Maybe you need to stop being so hard on yourself.  Think about the Laffer curve.  You get diminishing returns when you tax yourself too much.

comment,"Asian as well, my mom also didn’t like the idea of working and extending my graduation.

To be honest I kinda understand the point, you need to balance the benefits of getting work experience, not excessively delaying your graduation, and still enjoying your time on campus.

For me that meant only working in the summers. Two internships for me ended up being enough to find a good job after graduating. I also TA quite a few semesters, but don’t know if that had any impact.

I turned down a decent internship offer once because they asked me to work July-December and were not flexible on their dates. That would’ve prevented me from doing classes two semesters in a row. I didn’t feel that the cost of delaying for 2 more semesters was worth the experience. I just made sure to get an internship that summer instead.

Overall I found that co-op people do lose out a bit on campus life since they’re constantly in and out throughout their college careers. If you have decent friends it’s not too bad, but there definitely is an impact.

IMO summer internships, if you can get them, are the best of both worlds. You get decent experience, you don’t miss much on campus bc it’s summer, and you extend graduation (I guess you could take summer classes to graduate early but meh)

This system basically waits for students to get worse before actually helping (as far as I know). Doesn't seem like the most effective way to increase coping mechanisms. Also, I think we should try to change the culture around mental health here. Tech is hard, we all know that. But the administration doesn't need to continue to play this up so hard.

And I'm also not so sure if this is much as much a zero-sum game as u/CAndrewK implied. If professors were to lighten their workload, would GT automatically become less prestigious? GT can still be prestigious and give students more time for unwinding and living life.

Yes, the school may exacerbate existing problems in a student. But that doesn’t mean that it is solely the school’s fault for your depression or what have you. A lot of the stuff that plays into that is the way you live your own life, the relationships and goals you have etc. 

Essentially, y’alls argument is “I am depressed solely because of the school. I made bad grades, I was put under too much pressure, I was alienated from my social life etc. Therefore, the school should give me full coverage care for my issues because they are liable.” But really, you yourself are the most liable party. Maintaining your social life and not letting the stress get to you is an integral part of everyday life, and if you let those things go and you slipped into depression, you have to take some of that blame on yourself. It sucks to say, but a lot of us here are on the *brink* of depression, but we understand that and are proactive for our own mental health. We don’t let ourselves fall down and then blame GT.

I was one of the students going through a hard time and decided to get better by setting up an appointment to get professional help...only for my appointment to be set many weeks later and getting delayed yet again by another week one day before the appointment date. People want to get help before it’s too late and they do so on their own accord, but GT makes that pretty damn hard. 

Since I had soooo much time before anyone could get to me I ended up getting help elsewhere and coping on my own, but I know that GT’s services made me feel incredibly demotivated and I did feel that my problems weren’t worth their time unless I’m on the brink of killing myself.

More on how bad it is here: https://apnews.com/8c3cdbf1fa22472fb33318e5499e888c (side note: u[sic]ga is one of the “schools” they call out for failing to accurately report data, but we all know that we’re capable of exceeding the standards of that school) 

So this, coupled with personal anecdotal evidence (which is based primarily on observations at the student health center of the OOS SEC school I transferred from and to two friends who’ve had experiences with two different mental health centers at OOS ACC schools) is where I kinda derive my nebulous “average” assignment from (quite honestly, we’re probably even a little better than par for the course).

I found a better source for when I first cited the MIT suicide rate statistic, but this Boston Globe article found that, of colleges that responded to their inquiry about suicide rates, that MIT had the highest: https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/16/suicide-rate-mit-higher-than-national-average/1aGWr7lRjiEyhoD1WIT78I/story.html

That's what the mindset *should* be, but depression isn't exactly logical, and most people looking to visit a counselor are past the point where they can will themselves into trying to fix their own situation. Saying ""we're all on the brink of depression, you just need to manage better"" is a really shitty attitude to have when it comes to mental illness- it only lays the blame on the person with the disorder and does nothing to fix this (widespread) issue.

If we could all be ""proactive for our own mental health"", there wouldn't be a need for the counseling center in the first place. Part of the reason it exists is to help people do just that, and it's the shittiest feeling in the world knowing that your appointment is several weeks out.

Also, as a CmpE you'll know enough CS to secure a lot of CS jobs if you're ever interested in going into pure software.

That being said: as a CmpE you can still fill your electives with ECE or CS classes, which gives you a lot of flexibility in what you want to focus on in your 3rd/4th years.

Mental health is not a blame game, and you can do everything you can (be social, etc) to try and balance, and still very much be suffering. I am so glad and thankful that you are taking care of yourself, but the coping abilities of every single person are different.   
Mostly what I was trying to get at is that life, in general, is stressful, and Georgia Tech makes that especially so. Many students are still learning coping strategies and sometimes when that doesn't happen effectively, mental health can diminish (it did for me). The only discussion of mental health I've heard from Georgia Tech when something awful happens. For me, it feels like they only say something so it looks like they're doing something to help (but when in reality no real change has been made).

I literally came to this subreddit to create a thread on mental health, and how we need to keep focusing on it. And guess what, the top post is talking about the same thing.

They need to make changes so badly. And they need to make reparations for the trauma they've caused their students by wrongfully sending them to psycho-wards. And turning people away because they don't have enough resources. And making people wait weeks before they get to talk to someone because their issue isn't ""important enough"" to them.

The actual worst thing about all of this is that nothing will likely change, because the administration does not want to bring light to this issue. So it's gonna take another one of our brothers and sisters to kill themselves before we start seeing them care. Wasn't Scout enough to tell you how fucked up mental health is here?

I think where a lot of people go wrong is not using those 22 hours of electives well. If you graduate having taken like 1-2 architecture courses, a couple networking courses, and a couple random CS-like electives it is possible that you will come out not really being specialized, and if you don't have an amazing GPA or extracurricular it can be harder to find a job.

But I have had CmpE friends do more traditional CS stuff (like full stack development), friends do networking, and I specialize in VLSI/computer architecture. And all of us have had no problems with jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

I will say that a field like VLSI or computer architecture is probably harder to get an internship in your first couple years (compared to some CS positions).

I think what y’all have done this year and with this reddit account is very much a step in the right direction. However, please don’t fall into the trap of becoming gatekeepers. SGA has always had this annoying tendency to become gatekeepers of knowledge, “power”, etc. Your job isn’t to do everything for students and know things and purposely not tell, it’s to empower students to make changes and recommendations themselves. And look I understand the student apathy problem, it’s a lot easier to complain then to actually contact someone or write an email, but when you say things like you will contact someone in this department and this administrator and whoever, it can make students feel powerless and that the only voice they have is through SGA.  SGA should not be the only group with knowledge, SGA reps and veeps shouldn’t be the only ones contacting those in charge, that breeds arrogance. They work for us, not SGA and not themselves. So please, reach out on students’ behalf, but don’t make it so they can only do that through you, avoid being a gatekeeper at all costs. SGA shouldn’t know more or have any more power than an average student here.

Staff at psychiatric facilities tend to be less receptive then at a doctor's office, say. However, the staff could be in legal trouble if someone kept a record of them denying rights of patients. One can request the form from the staff and then keep record of at what time one asked what person for the form and inform the person on hand that you requested a form at such and such time from such and such and ask again. If they continue to igonore you, keep these written down and keep a good relationship with patients/cleaning people etc...

Riding alongside parked cars is one of the most dangerous parts of cycling and you should always be looking to see if someone is going to open a door in your face. Also, if you feel unsafe in the bike lane, you can always move into the main lane of travel. I do this all the time.

That saaaaiiiid... I totally agree that the parking spaces don't need to exist. They're convenient for drivers, sure, but making car travel convenient is not always in the best interest of a city. In Atlanta, we really need to encourage people *not* to drive. Most trips in a city are short (&lt;1 mile) and many people could choose to walk or take a bus, but driving is often the best option.

I would agree in the cases of med school just because I've never been through the process. A grad school would much rather see your research accomplishments and a generally high GPA, but a few B's sprinkled through are fine since they understand people make mistakes. Internships care even less.

comment,"I've had a very, very positive experience. It's an extremely elegant place to live as a young person, maintenance takes its job seriously (maybe a little too seriously), the amenities are awesome, and there are lots of cute dogs. It's insane to think that I'd be paying more to live on campus. And it definitely should be cheap for you if you're splitting a one-bedroom unit with your roommate.

Fees-wise, we had to put down a pretty big security deposit. I guess that's the big one. And the utility services -- which are not included in the monthly rent -- have all had their own hidden fees (e.g. setup/initialization fee).

I definitely don't recommend moving here if you're planning on counting pennies / having a very specific and tight budget, as the specific monthly cost is hard to predict. Hidden fees aside, utilities are a variable cost in the adult world, and therefore rarely ever predictable.

comment,"To directly answer your question: assuming you're up to a 3.5, you shouldn't worry about your grades. 

As others have commented, it's definitely possible to get in while in the 3.0 - 3.5 range, although the closer you get to the lower end, the more you'll have to do to outside of class to make up for it. Don't really know of anyone that got in with less than a 3.0, but I doubt that it's literally impossible: I know of people who have been researchers, interns at top companies, and even TAs, with sub-3.0 GPAs. Those things tend to lead to grad school acceptances when coupled with a good GRE score and good rec letters.

Research and internships are excellent sources of recommendation letters. They're worth your time. In general, you'd be in pretty good shape with a letter from a professor that taught you, a letter from a researcher/professor that you did research for, and a letter from your internship supervisor / boss.

So I would choose whichever you think will be more enjoyable.  Can't speak to CompE or really sysarch (haven't taken OS classes) but the devices thread allows you to take some cool classes involving robots, embedded systems, and processor design.  Processor design is in Verilog, and you write code which is synthesised into actual hardware.  So you get the slightly higher level understanding, but still have to take into account things like propagation delay.

Honestly I don't recommend CS to anyone unless you really like it.  Anything they are teaching comes from books or the internet, so it's easy to teach yourself the relevant stuff.  If you want to learn how to actually build hardware, maybe CompE is the better route.

For two people, you should maybe each budget $100 for everything (power, gas, water/sewer, Google Fiber, renter’s insurance) on top of the fixed rent + maintenance amounts and you’ll be good. Most of the time it won’t come close to that, but there’s definitely peace of mind associated with setting a high budget &amp; not neurotically minimizing utility usage. 

I spent quite a bit on my couch, mattress, and TV stand, but that was a personal choice. Nothing stops you from having inexpensive furniture, but in my experience you get what you pay for in terms of comfort, build quality, and aesthetics. And I’m kind of a introverted potato, so I really value soft surfaces / materials (your priorities and lifestyle may differ from mine). But one fact is inevitable: the apartments are really beautiful, so ugly furniture will really stick out. 

Also, a word of advice — don’t split each furniture purchase 50/50. That only ever leads to headaches and conflict if you two ever stop being roommates. Instead, make a list and divide the purchases between yourselves, so that there’s no uncertainty about who owns what.  ",Neutral,"budget, furniture, roommates",2,2018-12-04

But to everyone blaming Georgia Tech and making it seem like we have a suicide epidemic specific to our school: National suicide rates are at 13.42 suicides annually per 100000 US citizens (as of 2016). Adjusted for our schools population, that would be 4.67 suicides annually.

From what I recall of this year, that really isn’t too far off of the real number. Even if we are at 7 or 8, it is unsurprising that a more stressful environment than the typical American is currently enduring would yield more suicides than average. It’s not some huge epidemic that GT needs to deal with, it is a fact of life in America.

There are so many promises that have been made and not kept.  I have stayed up so many nights on suicide watch because my fellow students had nowhere to turn.

Maybe we are seeing these events more publicized because families want to raise awareness; a friend of mine committed suicide in 2016 and Tech very much discouraged the family from sending anything publicly.  They felt forced into a decision, and just sent a general form email to the school announcing his death.

I knew 6 people (very) personally who took their own life during undergrad.  To me, it seems like an epidemic.  It is not fair to those who have tried again and again to reform mental health services - and to those who have serious mental health issues caused by Tech's culture - to say that suicide is just ""a fact of life in America.""

Either way, hang in there, I can attest that it does get better. I had a sub 3.0 GPA my junior spring, my dog had just died, I hated my fraternity and the people running it, I was awkward around girls, and I felt like it was too late to reach my goal of getting into graduate school. All of those problems have since resolved; I left the fraternity that same year, I have a fantastic girlfriend, I'm in graduate school at Tech after fixing my GPA, and I've come to realize that while Tech makes you feel insignificant and small, that's because you're surrounded by people who are smart and (often) awkward too; broaden your horizons beyond these walls, and you'll come to realize how amazing you actually are. I never would have reached that if I'd killed myself, and I'm thankful everyday that I hung in there.

comment,"You're making suicide sound like an inevitable part of life when it's more like a preventable disease. I'm not saying suicide can be entirely eliminated, but we need to realize that these numbers could be much lower (in the US and GT) if we take deliberate action to prevent suicide.

This may seem unrelated but stick with me (or watch this video and skip this paragraph https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlFnPAydJgk&amp;t=444s). Think about a car crash. When there's a car crash, nobody really cares that much because they this it's just an inevitable part of life. Cars crash all the time, it's an unavoidable risk of driving. Yet when a plane crashes, everyone freaks out and pilots and engineers all get together to figure out what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again. Plane crashes aren't viewed as inevitable, they're a problem that needs to be analyzed and prevented in the future. Car crashes and plane crashes can't be directly compared given the differences in scope, but if we apply this ""car crash"" mentality and ""plane crash"" mentality to different hospitals in how they view line infections, there's a much lower number of deaths due to infection in hospitals with the plane crash mentality.

Sure what you said may make statistical sense, but GT doesn't HAVE to be like the rest of the US. It doesn't have to be worse either. If we all recognize how big of a problem this is and fight for change, there's no reason we can't be much, much better than the average. We already are in academics. 
I just wanted to say this so that nobody reads this and thinks it ISN'T GT's fault. If we're just at the average numbers, then GT isn't doing enough to prevent suicide.

I assume student deaths are tracked and reported to a higher agency but there are no requirements for public universities to publicly report suicide rates. https://www.science37.com/blog/college-depression-suicide-data/ 

And then I started thinking about how the public could get that data.. The CDC started doing research on guns from a public health perspective, so i assume an institution like that could do this type of research and would have access to the records of public universities. 

GT students need to come together and demand that GT starts tracking these numbers and taking a scientific approach to the unacceptable number of suicides we experience on campus.

Additionally, GT students in public health and psych and pre med could research this with the CDC and that study would be important on a national level. GT could get ahead of the PR nightmare and lead a campaign to get data from all public universities.

I understand your point, but I don't think that it really matches the state of the American university system. Colleges (including GT) bill themselves as a place where students can come and be a part of a community, essentially as a stepping stone between living with your parents and being out on your own.

Of course they messed up, but if a scheduling error/possibly having to spend a semester longer here/possibly losing $30k is enough to make you understand why people commit suicide and take you to a point where you don’t know what you’d do if someone didn’t pick up the phone, there is some sort of mental instability there. Maybe that is caused by other aspects of tech, I don’t know. But the stress of $30k alone doesn't lead a mentally healthy person to consider suicide, and you can't blame that situation alone on causing you to rationalize suicide. I fully understand how much money that is. No amount of money is worth a life, and a mentally healthy person will easily realize that. Again, I do not intend to be patronizing. Mental struggles are a result of so so many things acting together. I just really strongly feel we can't say that all of those things are tech related. ","Negative

I don’t want to offend anyone, but ending your life is not brave and should not make you a martyr. What is brave is every day you live your best life and try to make the world a little better even when it doesn’t feel like you can.

It’s incredibly sad that so many people are hurting so much that they believe ending their life will make things better. The truth is suicide only makes things worse. Just look at how it always comes in waves. When Scout died, several of their friends followed shortly after. And to make it even worse, we still saw no real and significant change.

The way we can make a difference is insisting as a student body (and in the future as alumni who GT counts on for $) that Georgia Tech needs to value students mental health. I personally plan on writing some letters to Georgia Tech administration highlighting the negative experiences I have had with the mental health services and the overall academic environment, which can be downright toxic. I encourage all of you to also make yourselves heard.

And by all means, if you ever feel like your life isn’t worth living or you feel otherwise depressed, anxious, etc talk to someone about it.

These are essentially statements from SGA on certain topics, and there have been times in the past where we stated our support/lack of support for things due to overwhelming student body opinion in favor or in opposition of it (ex. campus carry: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2KiTttISh7mUWtiX2RnZTN6d2s/view?fbclid=IwAR282vQ553QCGQL7guNiYAv8ZuJfKgz5swREhSK384MnOVrB59Tr0VUMzj8](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2KiTttISh7mUWtiX2RnZTN6d2s/view?fbclid=IwAR282vQ553QCGQL7guNiYAv8ZuJfKgz5swREhSK384MnOVrB59Tr0VUMzj8)).

If you don't know who that person is, you can reach out to us on Reddit or one of the reps listed on our website ([http://www.sga.gatech.edu/ug/docs/UHRFall2018Roster.pdf](http://www.sga.gatech.edu/ug/docs/UHRFall2018Roster.pdf)), and they should be able to get you in contact with the right people.

comment,"I’ve thought about killing myself after transferring here two years ago. Most of the time it was just small thoughts or quick day dreams, which I knew would lead to nothing. 

Then one day, after Fall 2017, I almost did it. I found out my grades for semester and I failed 2110. I was only a couple points off by my calculation. I blamed myself. I felt like an idiot. I felt like I wasn’t worthy of bothering to even go to school. I felt as though I was a disappointment to my friends and family. I was scared to face my parents and I was scared to think I wouldn’t graduate in four years with my best friends.

So I started driving to a lake nearby my parents home. I was going to just drive right in and what happened would just happen. But I didn’t. I couldn’t. I thought of my sweet old mom having to bury her youngest son, who she fought tooth and nail to keep alive after being born with complications. I thought of my best friends who would have to go a whole semester and a year without a roommate. I’m sure my loud, idiot presence would be missed, or so I hope. I imagined my fat orange cat who graciously waits for me to come home from college on the weekends, laying on my bed eternally. I thought to myself: there is more to life than just me and school. 

I ended up driving home and talking about my semester with my parents. Surprisingly, they were so supportive of me. In high school they’d yell or just make me feel bad that I’m not doing well enough (brown parents 😂).But they understood Tech wasn’t the same and they told me it’s okay to fail. And that whenever I do, they’ll be there to catch me and support me. I didn’t tell them about my plans to kill myself. But I’m thankful for their words.

After last week, with the suicide, my dad called me up and told me my mother was crying. He informed me she was worried that I’d kill myself too because she knew how stressed I was due to the amount of credits I’m attempting in order to graduate on time. Then for one of the few times in my life, I heard my dad cry. And he told me that it doesn’t matter what grades I get, or when I graduate. They told me what matters is what I make of life and that I’m happy with it. If that means not going to school, or if that means just hanging at home for a few years, they’re behind me 100%. I wasn’t planning on doing anything, as despite the stress I am happy right now with life. But I was taken back. 

For anyone reading this that doesn’t feel good about life or just feels shit about school. You’re not alone. Grades and graduation dates do not determine who you are. You are beyond a number. You are flesh, blood and love. You have family and friends that love you. You have a personality, hobbies, interests and are allowed happiness. If you ever find yourself stressed after studying for hours upon hours, pause and do something else. Call a parent or sibling. Text a friend. Watch TV or play games. Go to the gym. We have so many other things to do in 2018, just do something.  And if you don’t want to do any of those or don’t have anyone to talk to, please message me. I’ll talk to you. You are above all of this. Please take care of yourself and know you are important. ","Positive

Some people just need someone to listen. 

Anxiety and depression don't manifest themselves the same way in every person; while some may seclude themselves others might not, and while some might benefit from social interactions like going out or being around friends, this may not be the case for others and may exacerbate the problem.

Even though our opinions are based on our own experiences, we have to take into account not everyone goes through things the same way. In other words, if you see someone struggling dont just offer to help but, as OP mentioned, actively seek to incorporate them into your plans. Although we might not know what will work best we can only try our hardest and hope something we do puts a smile on their face.

Nothing seems to have changed, and that is very sad. Tech can be a miserable place. Unless you are at the top of the class, it can feel like nothing you do is good enough even though you try as hard as you can to do well. As a student, you are a machine that turns coffee into work, not a real person. There is value in struggling and growing into a better student, but Tech takes that to a toxic extreme. 

That being said, the administration knows what kind of environment we have here. They act sad and shocked when things like this happen, but do very little to try and change things. It’s not going to make Tech less of a school to be slightly less rigorous, and it’s not going to make Tech less of a school to add resources to make mental health a priority. I know that talking about suicide leads to copycat deaths, but that also gives them the perfect cover to sweep this under the rug and hope for less casualties next semester.

comment,"Your thoughtful post brings forward a comment I have wanted to address. I am so glad to hear about the support your parents are giving you. Actually in tears here because I know that most parents would respond that way and I also understand the reluctance students have about having these discussions with their families. 

Speaking from the parent perspective, do not be afraid that you will disappoint us in any way. We love you and we want nothing more than for you to be happy in life. We're here to support you and we realize that sometimes there are twists in the road and we know that rest stops are there for a reason.

In fact, many of us parents have experienced depression and anxiety that you may not be aware of. We can help you through this, no doubt.

We also know you - what you enjoy, what you don't like, your strengths, your insecurities... yes, we all have them. 

Here's how the conversation starts: "" I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed this semester, and I'd like to talk about it."" Then offer them some specifics so they can get a sense of what is stressing you. They may not have answers right away, but their support will help you.

I know a young man who was deeply into drugs and essentially leading a double life because no one knew about it, not even his wife. Eventually he was arrested and now he gives talks to students about his experience. I've heard him say that the day his charade came to an end he had the best night of sleep in years. I suspect that opening up to your family will probably bring you this type of relief as well. The stressors will still be there, but an honest discussion will help you gain additional perspective.

If you are depressed or anxious, and staying silent, please begin this conversation with your parents, a sibling, or other trusted family member.    

As a final note, after having this discussion please consider taking advantage of your parents insurance benefits and seek professional help during break. I have not seen any comments on this, but perhaps you have not sought mental health services in your home community because your family is not aware of your struggles.

This university has a harmful stereotype, and I honestly do not know what the administration is doing about it since I've been reading here at Reddit and been working here at Georgia Tech.

comment,"I would say we have a fair bit of sway, especially depending on the issue. Not many people realize the sheer size of SGA- our committees generally have anywhere from 3-25+ members. On top of that, you have VPs, Presidents, and Representatives. Most of these people meet with administrators at least once. From my experience with dining and campus life, administrators have been absolutely amazing and super easy to work with. There are certainly some areas that may be more difficult for us to make changes in quickly, but even still administrators are often inclined to at least listen to SGA reps who come and speak with them, as our duty is to represent the student body and theirs should be as well. 

Some past examples: 

\-Special Institutional Fee : Grad SGA pushed to get this reduced by around $200 so far for graduate students from around $445. This will eventually be going down to $0

\-Dining : We had students directly involved in the RFP process. This included voicing our experiences and opinions we had heard from the student body. I can't say much more than that right now since I have yet to hear from the Office of Procurement regarding the official release of the decision, but I can assure you we had students who were able to directly voice opinions during the process.

\-Sustainability : Everything from working to get composting added in WV to now trying to get plastic straws removed from dining halls.

\-Student Center: We've been able to work pretty closely with the new Student Center team to ensure that certain things stay or go. This helped a lot when Under the Couch was being debated (shoutout to the Musician's Network as well, who some of our reps worked with to save it)- we actually had someone come and speak to UHR about this and how we could keep it in the new SC without removing any already planned projects.

I'll speak with some reps today and see if I can get you some more specific examples as well! I'm new to SGA this year so I'm citing what I've heard of since then.",Positive,"sga, student representation, campus life, dining, sustainability, student center, institutional changes",18,2018-12-05

comment,"To preface, I respect that the administration is attempting to help the student body. I realize that this is something that has been talked about a good bit, but based on this latest instagram post by georgia tech, I thoroughly believe that those in charge don't understand the problem. While it is clear that they are trying to help, this is evidence that they dont understand student life and the reasons that students are pushed to states of bad mental health. This institute is very rigorous and because of this students have high levels of stress and low levels of sleep. Among many other causes, this is why Georgia Tech students often face mental health issues. And I'm not directly saying that Georgia Tech is responsible for providing help for all of this, but the fact that they claim that they are here to help is what makes this upsetting. 

They claim to have students interest in mind and though they actually may, their actions are not nearly as helpful as they could be with just a little more thought. Open Door day is a very good idea, dont get me wrong, but the irony of the situation is that Georgia Tech allots a single day in which students dont have classes to allow them to study for finals. While I'm not going to get into the debate about whether this is a sufficient reading period, I will acknowledge that this is when students' stresses are at their peak. Making open door day fall on only day that these students have been given to prepare for finals is a joke. The students who need help are likely so stressed about classes that they will sacrifice their health to do well because of the importance that is put on finals. 

Students are not going to take time out of their only dedicated reading day to get help for the exact reason they need help, being their stress from school and grades. Of course this makes a few generalizations and assumptions but I believe it to be accurate in most cases. Open door day should be a very recurring thing throughout the year not just a single day, and it especially shouldn't be on the only day that the institute gives us to study and prepare. It just goes to show that the administration doesn't understand the problem and I want to use this platform to educate. I do appreciate their willingness to help, but I would really like to see them connect with students and hit at the root of the problem that is clearly not being seen at the moment. 

TLDR; Open door day being on the same day as our only reading day shows how much the administration does not understand the concerns and problems that students currently face regarding mental health. ",Negative,"mental health, student life, georgia tech administration",43,2018-12-05

comment,"Personally, I feel really passionately about campus services (particularly dining and PTS) as well as mental health initiatives and communication with administrators. 

I have some strange dietary issues as well as some mobility issues that prevent me from being able to walk across campus some days, and I have seen that there is a LOT of room for improvement in campus services. They seem to be areas that many people talk about but not many address or make changes in (I feel similarly to mental health and communications as well), and I would love to see that changed. There shouldn't be multi-hour waits for food when it snows. We shouldn't see 2+ posts a week about someone finding a bug in their food. People should be able to find food that meets their dietary restrictions any given day, any given time, without having to wait 30+ minutes. Those with mobility issues should be able to rely on the buses or other forms of transport to get them to class reliably, on time, and consistently. These are things that I would like to see happen on campus, but we have a long way to go. 

I have immediate family and very close friends who have been directly affected by mental health. Last year, I had to contact GTPD for help because I got a phone call from a friend who was having a mental health crisis. They are absolutely amazing. On campus, I'd be interested in exploring things such as partnering with Emory's Postdoc counseling program, integrating programs into GT1000 that aim to destigmatize mental health and encourage seeking counseling even before it's needed, and ensuring we partner with highly-ranked mental health centers outside of the school that we can confidently recommend students go to for additional help. I think this is a big issue on any campus, and I would love to see more collaboration between our students who have personal experience with mental health challenges and administrators. Additionally, it would be great if we could decrease the amount of time it takes to get an appointment with a counselor. 

As a spinoff of that, I'd like to work on building more open lines of communication between administration and the student body. I wasn't in SGA last year (besides FreShGA, which doesn't have much involvement with the rest of SGA), and I definitely felt like the entire organization was mysterious and hard to bring myself to approach. I would love to see our role become one where students feel like they can come to us about anything they'd like to see changed on campus and we can help get them in touch with the right people to make those changes happen.

The Trustees approve the annual budget and have decision-making authority over hiring/firing of coaches.

All 10 [Executive Cabinet](http://www.sga.gatech.edu/ug/?q=executive) members meet regularly with their respective administrators to voice student opinion, direct initiatives, and get feedback on our own efforts. The Undergraduate House of Representatives (UHR) and Graduate Student Senate (GSS) have public discussion about our direction and can push administrators for action through resolutions.

Finally, administrators from President Peterson down to faculty call on elected members for feedback or how best to approach an issue. In these spaces, we are extremely influential. In others, we are bound by the same forces that bind our administrators. All this being said, all of our leadership is eager to meet to talk about how we're doing or just chat about school and life.

comment,"So this is definitely a tough one. Part of our goal moving forward is to bring students and administrators together so students can go to them directly when they run into issues and hold them accountable when they don't see things being addressed. 

I think a big thing I've seen here is the difference between communicating problems and addressing them. Through my experiences with dining specifically, there seems to be a lack of knowledge of student opinion from administrators, which I would love to see changed moving forward. This seems to be a huge contributor to why things seem to be not happening at an administrative level. Right now, SGA is the main way that gap is being bridged in many areas through communicating student opinions to administrators whose job is to then handle them. 

I as much as anyone completely understand the sentiment of wanting to hold those in charge accountable. Looking forward, that will definitely be a combined effort between students, SGA, and administration. If you have any suggestions for how you think we should do that, definitely let us know!

comment,"Response from Andrew:

The total cost for the bench is actually $10,000 through the GT Development Office. They handle the naming of buildings, gates, plazas, classrooms, benches, etc. all over campus and these items have a monetary amount that goes with the dedication of the area. In this case, the money goes towards the dedication, the bench itself, the installation, and then upkeep over the lifetime of the bench. It may seem pricey (and I don't necessarily disagree), but the organization fundraised from their members and alumni and came to SGA for the rest. One thing to note is that the cost funded through JAC is split 50/50 between the student and administrative sides unless otherwise noted.

comment,"Good point! So I talked with our sustainability committee chair about this issue. What's been happening is that the regulations we have in place (not sure if it's because of the company we're using or if it's a state law, but I can look into it if you would like) require that everything in the bags we give to the composting company we use be things that are able to be composted. What's happening is that people will throw things like plastic forks in the compost, and if that happens the workers are required to throw the entire bag away (the bags are clear so they can see inside). This is something the sustainability committee is working on with administrators- the two names I've heard are JulieAnne Williamson ([julieanne.williamson@carnegie.gatech.edu](mailto:julieanne.williamson@carnegie.gatech.edu)) and Sarah Neville ([sarah.neville@sustain.gatech.edu](mailto:sarah.neville@sustain.gatech.edu)), both of whom should be able to speak more on this topic and the regulations surrounding it if you reach out to them. 

Numbers-wise, 67% of waste goes to compost and recycling in West Village, including those composting bags that have to be thrown out due to contamination. I can assure you that we definitely DO compost the majority of compost bags in WV! ","Positive

class size is very much dependent on your major. Im studying MSE, and i dont think there's been a class yet in which my professor did not at least know half the class by face (not necessarily name). the people i've made friends with are in most of my mse classes, and have been since i was a freshman, and probably will continue to be in my classes until we graduate. making friends in a class of 200 people takes effort, and if you dont want to put in that effort, thats understandable, but then you dont get to complain that you dont know the dude that always sits next to you. if you dont make effort to converse, how do you expect to have any kind of meaningful relationship with them?

some profs want to challenge you. i agree its unfair to keep students in the dark about how well they are doing, and its stressful. to this, there's the canvas feature that shows how well you do with respect to other people. some profs in the past would announce approximately what the A,B, C cutoffs were (ie avg = 55 , a = 60, b = 50, etc).

for housing, i live on campus, and i like the housing system. a 2:1 person:bathroom ratio is more than i could have asked for. you're taking for granted that you have your own private bedroom, which is not necessarily the case. some of my friends (4 of them) that do not attend tech live in a 400sqft ish room. they have a single bathroom/sink, and no kitchen. its basically just a large room with 4 beds that are about 5 feet apart. i think its normal to not have a private room, and i am grateful that tech has enough housing for all its undergraduates. water is always hot and available, theres no problems with electricity or other amenities, and internet is basically the fastest available unless you want to drop $100 on a 10 gbps ethernet expansion card.

comment,"You articulated some of the exact thoughts I've had about the culture at Tech. 100% agree about the isolation of huge lecture-based classes. I have almost no friends in my major because I don't interact with anyone in my classes for the majority of the day. It's just a cycle of walking to a class, sitting through it for an hour, and walking to another class - it's easy to go a whole day this way with minimal human interaction. This is the first semester I've made a friend in a class (one of those people I finally struck up a conversation with after noticing we shared FOUR classes and had never spoken) and it makes going to that class so much more enjoyable. The camaraderie of the shared experience and short conversations before and after class noticeably boosts my mood. If Tech hired more professors and taught smaller classes which incorporated discussion, I agree that it would create a sense of community that is currently lacking.

Also agree with what you said about professors. Additionally, Tech needs to address the abysmal teaching skills that most professors possess. Many of my professors have made it patently obvious that their research comes first and teaching is an unfortunate stipulation to that. They are unprepared, talk to the whiteboard in a monotone, spiral into tangents, and present material in the most bland way possible. Some of the best professors I've had are actually lecturers, so their primary job is to teach and they are much better at it! As a student, I am happier in classes where I am actually engaged and excited about the material, rather than suffering through a dull class because it's a requirement.

That being said, at the end of the day, we are the ones who decided to pay money to attend this school, knowing full well that there's tens of thousands of students here and classes are massive. I went to a high school with an average class size of about 12 students, so it's been pretty hard to adjust to impersonal nature of life at Tech, but it's really up to us to make the most of our experience. Yes, it may be hard to make friends in a class of 250, and if you're someone who has trouble socializing and connecting with people in such an environment it may feel isolating, but walking around campus every day you will see plenty of students who are generally happy and love this school. College is all about developing skills and expanding your horizons, and struggling to figure out your own solutions is a key to growing as an individual.

comment,"When I went to Tech (90s) it was literally bootcamp. When you got out, the people you met in the professional world from Tech knew you were a hardass because of your degree, because they ""got out"" too. The things you describe sound quite a bit to me like the generic GT experience. I think maybe the only main difference between then and now is:

1) The GPAs and retention rates back then were both much lower. Sounds to me from your description that profs basically just curve more now than they used to, but I'm not even clear about that, because I've literally gotten an 18% as my final grade and had that curved to a B. In the 90s, average GPA was like a 2.4 and a third of people admitted failed out.

2) The admin back then didn't pretend they weren't doing it. They'd say basically, *""yeah, we could teach you all this material and make it much easier, and you'd still learn it, but we're not going to do that. We make it hard on purpose. The goal is not to learn engineering scholarship, the goal is to mold you into an engineer.""*

And I think there was a lot more honesty in #2, because trust me, engineering jobs suck. They are very unfun. The stress is high, the expectations are often outrageous, and the best employees are ones who can pin their ears back, swim through the stress like a duck in water, and deliver a good product in the face of those ridiculous expectations. GT had a reputation back then for not just teaching engineering, but building *engineers*.

Bootcamp.

I wonder whether GT's shift in the past decade to raising GPAs and retention rates has hampered #2. I don't really know, but I wonder. A lot of older generation GT folks wonder the same thing.

They were hired for their research interests and capabilities, teaching skills matter much less. It's the research results that get them tenure. So if you were one of them, what would you focus on?

\&gt; More on the professors- maybe it's just me, but a lot of them need a course on mental health. Not the, ""these are the warning signs of depression"" or ""this is how you spot a suicidal student"" classes, but the ""making all of your students think they're failing until the end of the semester and then curving the class at the end isn't cool"" course. Having a student go MONTHS on end working their ass off, stressing out, thinking that they're failing a class, and then you magically swooping in and ""making it work out"" in the end is not okay. I'm tired of being stressed all semester thinking I'm going to barely get a C in a class, only to pull out a B because you curve the class by 15 points. Put in the effort to make your exams accurately reflect the knowledge a person should have. If a person fails an exam, it should be because they failed to learn the material, not because the average was a 52, so really, they did better than a majority of the class. **I'm tired of seeing my classmates as competitors. I'm in a class right now where an A is awarded to the top 20% of the class. I'm sure you'll be \~shocked\~ to know that a majority of Piazza questions go unanswered because no one wants to help anyone get a better grade. Everyone is secretly hoping that everyone else does poorly, so they can look better**. I get that this is how it is in the real world, but at least in the real world, you have allies. You have a department to work with or an IT guy to help you. Here, you're in a massive lecture hall with no IT guy to joke with or Janice from HR to get lunch with. You're by yourself and there's no one leaving cake in the break room. Personally, my GPA doesn't define me, but it does define the tens of thousands of dollars in tuition scholarship that I get, and without it, I can't go to school here. So don't tell me that I shouldn't stress about the grade to begin with. 

There is a lot in here that I want to process and don't feel I can do it in one response.  There isn't anything you said that I disagree with but I want to talk about the part I highlighted. Many faculty (GT is &gt;50% full professor) came of age where grading on a 'bell curve' or pre-defining a grade distribution was the norm. Frankly, it no longer should be - it is out of line with modern educational practice. It is also more often than not a cover for poor instructional practices. Most faculty at GT are not promoted/rewarded for their education prowess, they may be lauded for it but they are not rewarded for it. That is the nature of a modern research institution. Whether that should or shouldn't be is off topic to this post though.

However, there are things you can do. In the end, GT does have the ability to define what a grade is. The university policy is here: [http://catalog.gatech.edu/rules/5/](http://catalog.gatech.edu/rules/5/). I would encourage students to work with SGA to advocate for changes in that policy that you think are more fair and reasonable. You could make it explicit that grades are absolute (i.e., based on individual performance against an equal standard) and that a 'bell curve' approach where grades are assigned based on relative-performance is not acceptable. Don't rely on faculty to change on their own, force GT to fix things that need to be fixed. They are hesitant because they don't want to intrude on 'faculty freedom.' However, when faculty being free to act a fool interferes with students rights and fair treatment they should and already do (e.g., a faculty member cannot unilaterally penalize you because they think you committed academic misconduct).

Separately, it may seem hard to believe, but most of the faculty do really care about the students. Some of them are just really bad at articulating or showing it - not an excuse just an observation. Some of them feel that assigning grades on a relative curve is actually pro-student, because it helps you know your performance relative to peers and motivates. As wrong as that may be, it is well intended (and yes, I know that doesn't help much). That doesn't change what you experience, but I'm hoping it might change your framing a bit - an assumption of malice only multiplies the feelings.

1.) Make sure you're sleeping enough (most important imo so it's number 1). If you don't have finals in between now and the final for this class take a nap maybe once a day too.

2.) Make a list of all the main topics that will be on the final exam and ration them out evenly among the days you have left before the exam. Leave 1 day of break or space just in case on one of the days you don't get through everything. 

3.) Study fundamentals if you don't have time to study details. Not sure what class this is, but a lot of academic areas have a set of fundamental - overarching ideas that drive most of the topics in the classes. Sometimes, it's comically simple how all the topics in a class relate to one idea. (For example, basically of LinAlg is basically orthogonality and symmetric matrices). If you can find the underlying concepts you can derive or reason out the more complex ones when you're taking the exam. 

4.) (Slightly related to 3) Look for connections between topics. Understand the ""story"" of your class and how each chapter relates to the others. This will also help recall if you're struggling to remember something exactly on the test. 

5.) If you feel like you're going to have a mental breakdown (I have these too), jump on a video call with a friend, take a break and go get cookout with your roommate, or just put on some music and clear your head for a while.

Nobody knows when you go to class and when you don't, and the only interaction you can really have with the ""faculty"" is the through the TAs.

There's a reason why people bother to attend reputable institutions such as GT, MIT, Harvard, etc. It's true that at each of these universities the primary focus is on research.

Makes you kinda feel insignificant to the grand scheme of the university, definitely contributed to me skipping a big chunk of lecture. But I gotta say that happens at other large state schools, it's not unique to GT.

College is the easiest time in your life to meet other people, freshman year especially. Unless you're a social butterfly it's tough to befriend peers in lecture. I barely met anyone in lecture or recitation. Joining clubs was the key to me making any friends outside of class. After college it gets a lot harder to make friends...many of my classmates that have graduated and moved to new cities (even the most extroverted) ones always bring up when we catch up ""man it's hard to make friends as an adult"". And tbh the solution now is still the same: join clubs, get involved. Well now they're like office kickball leagues and not as cool as some of the common interest clubs available at GT.

Yes the professors do suck and I barely learned anything from my clearly research focused professors. But the isolation from lecture sizes can't be blamed, every other big school has that. The big culprits are combatting students with set percentiles for letter grades is archaic and stressful as fuck.

I would (wrongly) tell myself that GT has a culture of complaining and that it really could not be that much different at other colleges.

And wow was I wrong. I realized something was up in my junior year. There's a reason everything seemed to suck so much as it did. GT's goal is to extract as much money from its students as possible and preserve its brand. The ""diploma"" they hand you at graduation is actually a letter requesting you to donate to the institute. So the day I saw GT's business model as opposed to the material needs of the students it made more sense.

Dining: Did you know we contracted with Sodexo for our dining services? The same Sodexo that regularly fails health inspections and employs prison labor. We just outed them and signed a contract with Aramark, which is even worse.

Transportation: Years ago, bus drives tried to unionize and were immediately gutted. PTS then signed a contract with a company called Groome for buses. See the trend here? Notice how students have no say in these decisions and that the goal is always more privatization of services that should be public.

Bookstore: No comment needed.

Counseling: Others on this sub have spoken ad naseum about our mental health services. Know that not a single full-time counselor has been hired in over a year after a student was killed by campus police. Why? Competitive salaries are not being offered. President Peterson makes over 1 million a year though.

Psychiatry: $25 fee starting with the third appointment.

Can't help but compare these departments with UGA's and see that both dining and transportation are publicly run services and widely revered by students. They are also much more equipped with counselors for a school with 10,000 more students.

The value of Georgia Tech comes from seizing the opportunities that are given. Go compete with robotics/car/rocket/whatever teams, do research with some of the most highly cited professors in the world, volunteer at a makerspace and do your own thing. But also join the marching band, the dance groups, hang out at Under the Couch. Be a real person.

The biggest criticism I have of this post is the lecture halls thing. *There is nothing stopping you from asking the person next to you to go for lunch. That change starts with you.* And guess what? Once you make a real friend in class, you won't be posting questions anonymously to Piazza and complain about how nobody helps you, because you'll be working on homework with your friend, and their friends. Your test scores will go up because you studied with a friend, you didn't half ass it in your room while watching Netflix. *Administration can not do ANYTHING to make your life holistically better, it is up to you.*

You need to understand that the demographic here is mostly nerds that have been carried by people socially their whole lives. Nobody is going to waltz up to you and ask to be your friend and offer to solve your emotional problems for you. This isn't high school, you are not inherently valuable to your peers for being smart anymore. This hasn't sunk in for the vast majority of people here.

I'll be honest, I felt terrible when the semester ended, but my life didn't just fall into shambles. I did find myself in a rut for a few weeks, but once I stopped isolating myself and started talking to people about what I was going through it became much easier to handle. It was a lot easier to realize how this was just a small obstacle that I needed to overcome and in the long run it really didn't matter that much.

The next semester, I took it easy with a few credit hours and talked with a few resources on campus to help me become a better student because whatever I was doing wasn't working. Academic Success Center in Clough is great for that. They've got academic advisors (you can setup appointments pretty easily) that will sit down with you and help you create a success plan based on your needs (like it's seriously amazing how much they're capable of in a 20-30 min meeting).

Also, you've got Freshman Forgiveness :) GT understands that this transition from high school to university is insanely difficult for most people, so if you finish with a D or an F then you can retake up to two courses over one of the next few semesters and have the other one removed from your academic GPA calculations.

comment,"Judging by the way the upvotes of this post are so quickly fluctuating up and down, there are a lot of people who both agree and disagree. Personally I couldn’t agree more with what you said, and really like the way you articulated some things. There’s definitely a dichotomy at Tech of people who either love the place or can’t wait to get out. I think these groups are separated to a degree by those who quickly made meaningful relationships and those who did not. Tech doesn’t make it easy for these kinds of relationships to be organically formed, but I also agree that as a student body we don’t do enough to make this any better for ourselves. 

I think this is partially a remnant of the brutal culture of Tech’s past that other commenters have alluded to. It’s amazing to see the transition that a lot of freshman go through, coming in with high ambitions, only to see that many of the upperclassmen are counting down the days to graduation. This has become a constant feedback loop that is only gradually changing.

Trust me on this. Students at Tech aren't working any harder than they used to. The workload at Tech has always been more than any reasonable person could possibly do. At least back 3 decades, and I'd guess back way further than that. This isn't new.

That's not saying it's right or just, and not defending it. Just saying it is what it is. I have 2 GT degrees, my wife has 1 GT degree and 1 Stanford degree. I'm not sure I would ever send my kids to Tech.

Since suicide is the hot topic, here's a counterpoint. The reason for bootcamp in the military world is to create a ""safe space"" to harden people against the stresses they'll see in the field. The culture of Tech may increase suicides slightly while at school (I'm not convinced of this btw, I still haven't seen an analysis that shows GT suicide rates vs the national average) but the bootcamp may reduce workplace suicides post graduation.

comment,"The near entirety of your post is well-put, u/FreeHedgehog!  The mass-lecture model and excessive class size was a problem going back through the '80s when I was a student, from the weed-out Physics courses taught by Professor ""Staff"" through my senior AE courses with 50+ students per class.  The only time I was in a class with small class sizes was during summers (I went three summers, FWIW) when I had a couple of AE electives with maybe ten students in each.  I don't know the relative student population from the '80s when compared to now, but I feel society's ever-present quest that all institutions/businesses must ""grow"" is a problem, even for education -- more is not necessarily better.

I really appreciate that you made your post about something other than suicide/depression, while giving it a nod while starting out, plus also capping your post off with a mention of your personal struggles.

comment,"I'm also faculty in engineering. Agree that there is a lot here, but wanted to add a few comments.

- By far, the vast majority of professors care about students. If they didn't, there is no reason to be here. There are other places to do research for a better quality of life (higher pay, fewer other responsibilities) than being at a public school. There's just no incentive to be here if you don't care about students. That being said, there are many I don't agree with on what ""caring"" should look like in the way that they interact (e.g. ""tough love"").

- I don't want to minimize your feelings of being alone....those are real. But in my opinion, blaming lecture hall classes is misplaced. I've been affiliated with many universities, and this is not unique to GT in any way. Many people find their community by getting involved with student groups, etc. GT has as much (if not more) of this type of activity than anywhere else I have seen.

- I would also contend that the rigor and grading policies are not unique (though I am not trying to argue that the large curve grading policies are good). I've seen this in every top-tier engineering program that I've been affiliated with. What is unusual at GT is what percentage of the campus are exposed to the very rigorous STEM programs. For example, a quick google search (could be wrong) shows that Berkeley's undergrad population of 30k students is about 11% engineering. Here, the college of engineering website says engineering degrees are more than 60% of our 15k students. I didn't look up computing or science, but that's going to skew things even further.

- Of all the places I've been, the thing that really strikes me as unique here is the adversarial relationship that is embedded in student faculty relationships. I've only seen it from the faculty perspective here obviously, but I'm shocked at how many students come into my classes with the default expectation that I'm trying to screw them and they are justified in doing anything (including cheating) just to get their grade, regardless of whether they learn anything. I've had classes where I've had to be more harsh than I would normally want to because I'm dealing with so much of this. In some ways, these attitudes are embedded in the language...I ""got out"". In most places, students are celebrating what they've accomplished and what potential the future hols for them, but here the focus is on the negative aspect of it. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think there are cultural things that the faculty should be doing (which my colleague above discussed). But, there are also huge cultural attitudes in the student body here that are unique and that you have a (collective) responsibility to change as well.

- I'm talking a lot about student faculty interactions a lot because that's my exposure. I'm not trying to minimize the other issues....they all play a role. I'm just speaking to what I know about.

- As to the comment about something changing in the last 5 years. It's true....the baseline anxiety levels on everyone seem to have increased dramatically. But, it's not just here on campus. It's true in every community and friend group I'm a part of, even the ones not affiliated with GT. I think the political, news and economic environment has dramatically changed our whole country in these five years. I know it's easy to think of it only in terms of GT when you're a student because that's 99% of your interactions with the world, but our society seems to be changing rapidly.

comment,"Perhaps bring this up to your major! 

I’m almost done with my my BME degree and there’s only been 2 classes where there has not been a group component.

Either way you have people to go through the class with. That’s something your major could integrate if you think it’s a problem!

I will admit to not knowing a lot of IEs, but I see lots of support and peer-collaboration with my CS, and ME friends as well as my BME friends.

My experience was maybe ~80/20. I felt that most of my professors genuinely cared about me learning the material. But a significant portion made it clear that teaching us was a necessary evil to continuing their real work.

Is it really that simple for a professor to complete similar research at a higher paying private institution?

I'm just not sure I buy the claim that GT professors come here rather than MIT (for example) because they just love teaching.

comment,"The administration pushed the profs to change the curves, and the institution had a Come to Jesus moment about weed out classes. (Emag/Remag/3Mag)

That sort of pressure is all over academia now. At the top end it's because of how USNWR ranks schools, but at a deeper level it's because of the student loan program itself. Used to be that failing students out was ok because you'd just replace them. Now, with student loans, the name of the game in most academic institutions (less so for tech because we get so much money from GTRI) is to kite students through a program and squeeze as much tuition out of them as possible, which basically means you can't fail anyone out.

I taught as an adjunct at SPSU for a while, and I had students who I literally caught cheating, or who skipped weeks worth of class doing no work, and I was instructed to give them whatever opportunities necessary to catch their grades up enough to keep them from failing out. The academic dynamic itself has changed tremendously since the 1990s, because of the student loan program. It used to be that the academies were gatekeepers of the diplomas, and only gave them out sparingly to people who put in the effort. Now the students are (again, less so for Tech because GTRI money) the customers, and it's bad business to cut your customer off. You want to extract as much money from your customer as possible. Especially when they're buying your product with borrowed money instead of their own money, because then they're less sensitive to their own ROI. (again, the ROI issue isn't a big deal for Tech, but definitely is for someone in Gender Studies at Georgia State, for example)

Your tag says you're a computing prof. Go pull the 1990s grades from CS1501. Do some analysis over time. That class was literal garbage, would absorb far more effort than what you got from it in terms of hourly credits, and did nothing meaningful other than turn successes into failures. It didn't even teach you a language you could use in your career. But it was great from a ""bootcamp"" perspective.

What year did they do away with 1501? Why? Dig into the internal academic/political answers to these questions.

comment,"Sorry if I wasn't clear. I wasn't trying to compare one university to another. I was comparing faculty jobs in general to non-faculty ones (ie, working for a company, a national lab, etc.). There is absolutely no question that most of us could make either significantly higher salaries or have significantly lower stress (ie, clocking out at 5pm with no need for grant writing, etc.) if did our research in anther type of institution. There are other benefits that come with working at a university (e.g., theoretically more autonomy), but for the majority of colleagues I talk to, training students was a primary factor in their decision to work at a university instead.

Yes, at a place like GT you are going to get faculty that are *also* passionate about their research. If they didn't, they would likely be at another type of institution that is primarily teaching focused. I know from your perspective that seems like something that competes with attention paid to the classroom, and to some degree there is truth to that in the sense that it's a zero sum game. But, I would caution you to be careful what you wish for.  For example:

- Do you like graduating with a degree from a top-5 institution according to USNWR and the doors that this ranking opens for you? Take a look at what goes into those rankings. It's different for grad and undergrad, but these rankings are driven just as much or if not more by our research activity than by the classroom. You could choose to go to a more teaching focused school, but there is a reason that there are significant opportunties for graduates here and a substantial part of that reason has to do with the research that goes on here (yes, I know this doesn't make sense, but it's true).

- You talked about facilities, but you have to look at the revenue streams that support them. How does a new building get paid for? Often the state chips in some money, we get some donations, and anything else has to have a revenue stream. It's not a student center vs. research lab decision in such simple terms. There are different pots of money that are available to make those different types of facilities possible.

- I know it feels like you're paying a lot for tuition (because you are). I have paid it and am saving to pay it for my kids now. But at a place like this, the research funding is a fundamental part of the budget model. If I remember right, I think something like 30%+ of our income is from ""sponsored research"", which is more than tuition or state funding (which are both in the ballpark of 20% I think). That money pays for real things, including facilities and people that are valuable to you. For example, professors pay (depending on department and seniority) anywhere from 25-75% of their own salary off of grants because the tuition/state money alone isn't nearly enough to cover it. If the research goes away, we couldn't pay for many of the people teaching your classes.

So, I get that it feels like there are competing missions, and to some degree there is truth in that. But I would be careful for wishing we would emphasize it less. There are places that focus on teaching and many people chose to go there and get a great education. But there are opportunities here that are attractive that brought you here, and many of those would not exist without this research activity.",Neutral,"comparison, faculty jobs, non-faculty jobs, university, salaries, stress, research, institution, benefits, autonomy, students, passion, attention, classroom, usnwr, rankings, graduates, opportunities, teaching, facilities, revenue,",5,2018-12-06

Faculty make changes to courses and curricula all the time. Sometimes those changes are dramatic. Sometimes they come bottom up, sometimes there is pressure (or incentives) from above, but even when the changes come from above that doesn't mean at all that they are about changing the curve or whatever.

The College completely blew up its undergrad curriculum a little over a decade ago to create threads. There was a lot of talk about increasing flexibility, a lot of talk about incorporating the growing breadth of the field, a lot of talk about attracting students with broader interests, and a lot of talk about preparing students for what we thought was coming in the work world.  There was not any pressure to make those changes to raise GPAs. I'm not sure it came up once, and I was involved every step of the way.  

It's not how the faculty conceive of their jobs. Better pedagogy may lead to better learning, more engagement, and thus better grades, but those changes are an effect not the motivator. We just don't have those conversations.

comment,"I think this comment is filled with the exact platitudes the OP was saying are unhelpful from professors.

First, the ""vast majority"" of professors care about students. What does this mean? 60%? 80%? Because in my department (grad student), most don't. They write to publish, and often only teach on course per semester. There are plenty of reasons to stay here that aren't students- the pay (again, in my dept) is above average, the city of Atlanta is awesome, good weather etc, and there are tons of universities/colleges in the area where spouses or other family may be employed. So to say ""all the professors care, we wouldn't be here otherwise"" is total crap. Like even my own advisor is admittedly, ""not here for the teaching"".

I went to an ivy league undergrad, which Tech wants to so desperately be. These feelings of isolation at Tech ARE unique to tech. At my alma mater, I only took 3 classes in four years with more than 30 people, period. And there was a collegial atmosphere of ""well, we're all here, so we're all smart, let's get shit done"". So I'm not sure where your anecdotal evidence is coming from here, but based on my (also anecdotal evidence), saying ""many other universities are just like GT"" is disingenuous. 

The rest of your comment is basically anti-student and blaming the students and that's fine, it's your prerogative, but you are part of the problem the OP tried to call out.

As I say, that was *his baby.* I don't even think CS majors took it, it was the thing everyone else had to take and eat a C or a D on, while also impacting their grades in other classes because of the workload burden. It was widely known that your GPA would crash the quarter you took 1501 even within your other course load. Students would intentionally schedule around it, so the wouldn't take Emag and 1501 and Structures II (for instance) in the same quarter. An 18 hour student would bust themselves down to 12 or 15 hours the quarter they took 1501.

CS1501 was a weed out course. Everybody knew it. There were multiple weed out courses that were widely known among both the students and the faculty. Emag and CS1501 were paramount on the list. The concept of weed out courses was baked into the institution. GT would accept more freshman than it could graduate, knowing they were going to weed some out on their way to their degree with courses that were intentionally bullshit. 

And by my inspection, and talking to recent GT grads, GT expunged itself of weed out courses. That's not a bad thing. But it is a thing, and is part of the thing I'm talking about.

comment,"Thanks for clarifying, it's clear now what you were referring to. One point I'd add - just because a professor cares about teaching doesn't mean they're good at it. When the hiring process values researchers over teachers, you get great researchers and often poor teachers (even if they are passionate about teaching). From our perspective as students it can be tough to tell if our professor doesn't care about teaching, or just isn't very good at it. So maybe we over state the actual level off apathy from our professors. 

Personally, I have no issue with the Georgia tech / research institute ""system"". I knew what I was getting in to. As an in state student, I got a full ride to the #1 ISyE program in the country. I benefited from the research efforts which earned that #1 ranking. I had no qualms going to a school where the quality of my experience was not the priority. But lots of students don't know what they're getting in to. 

Info sessions and orientations and weird videos from the president about open-door-mental-health-day market GT as a place that values the student experience and our health. The money indicates that this is simply not the priority. That is a conscious and justifiable decision. But incoming students have a right to know what they're getting in to, and many do not. So some take out thousands of dollars in loans to attend a school that doesn't prioritize their experience and end up hating it. Some trudge through, some drop out, some kill themselves.

Some context right now: I am sitting outside my MSE class about 2 hours away from the final. I have 7 tabs open dedicated to PDFs for final review and about 10 more googling shit that I have no clue about and wasnt covered in the Slideshow the professor lectures with.

I am also slightly worried about the fact that the class Im right outside of is not actually the location of the final and I'll be screwed out of the $1000+ spent on the class with an D or F for missing the final.

Reddit is possibly the only place I can vent about my current frustrations ad I have no clue where my one friend in that class is or if he even knows where the MSE final is.

So take, at least mine, comments here on GaTech with a healthy dose of salt, or sugar, and know Georgia Tech is a lot more... friendly is a bit strong of a word, more like less stressful outside of exam season.

Additionally, I would add stress due to some pathways having a massive backlog (case in point, I don't have a green card to this day, and because of that, it is that much harder to find scholarships because of fine print that most US citizens and permanent residents take for granted). Moreover, certain visa types (dependent ones, such as the H4 to the H1B) prevent people from seeking internships and getting the work experience their friends are getting. This leads to isolation with a side of self-blame that kicks in when they wonder if they would have gotten the job if they had been eligible.  

Those who are applying for green cards have extra hoops to jump through if they have a mental illness- including additional documentation from a civil surgeon (doctors who specifically perform the immigration medical exam) that they are not a threat to themselves or others.

comment,"I don’t mean to comment of above replies but I just want to add my 2 cents.

Last year, fall 2017, I started as a freshman ME and of course I was initially super excited and proud that I had made it into Tech from a very small school where my graduating class had 88 people, most of whom went to community colleges. Almost as soon as I got onto campus, even I’m in FACET I began to realize how competitive and isolating it is to be on campus for lots of people.
In terms of classes, I only had one actual class that I enjoyed my first semester which was ME 1770, which was a very small classroom where my professor actually cared for her students. Other than that I was extremely isolated in large lectures and I was struggling horribly with mental health issues. 
I went to the counseling center and, in no fault of the faculty there, I was not able to be seen for 3 weeks. Once I did start at the counseling center all of the faculty was great but it was obvious that they were just not able to give the level of one-on-one personal care that many people need and they offered tons of “group therapy.” And while this may work for people who realized their issues early enough, it almost never helps people who are truly in a bad place. I was never once referred to the campus psychiatrist, even though I was not making much progress with traditional counseling. Hell I didn’t even know that there was a psychiatrist on campus until I did lots of digging online. 
In my spring semester my situation only got worse and I ended up petitioning and being granted a medical withdrawal from the entirety of Spring 2018. I originally planned to take the summer off and return in the fall, but since the antidepressants I initially tried were either not helping or actually making it worse I decided to take Fall 2018 as a gap semester to help myself. After lots of thinking I decided that Tech was not the place that I could be and I will not be returning to Tech to finish my degree. The campus environment is too competitive, toxic, and seems to have little care for students and all of the “academic help” programs felt to me like they were only offered because they had to be offered and there was little to no sincerity or actual help being offered. 
All of this being said, I am still proud that I was able to get into a top tier school like Tech, and I admire those who “make it out”, but it is not an environment or school that I want to be a part of anymore. Luckily I do still plan on getting my degree from another top tier public school, but it has taken me a long time to get here and I’m still going through hoops to get there.",Negative,"college, mental health, campus environment, academic support, proud",5,2018-12-06

comment,"I am from out of state. The onus of burden is not on Tech to make friends for you. I made friends through clubs, people I interacted with in my first classes. Hell, to be straight with you, I would ask to study with whoever seemed like a socially competent person on the first day. Make a groupme for that class, meet up and work to study before tests. 

The onus of this burden isn't on Tech. It is 100% solely on you. I think a lot of people don't quite understand the ""no hand holding"" that goes on here. Maybe other colleges are different, I wouldn't know. But lately, I see soooooo many people say that they never interact with people in their classes. That is their own fault. I know its 10x as hard to break the cycle, but you can break it. One step at a time. You're in a club? Great! Find out who the president is, and chat that person up. Club leadership will generally have a vested interest in talking to people in their orgs, use that. Leverage their responsibility to make friends. It might be disingenuous sure, but it doesn't make any difference after a week.

Georgia Tech is **not** cutthroat. I have never ONCE been in a ""competition"" or some such other horseshit with a classmate that wouldn't help me because they wanted to succeed by ensuring my own failure (so to speak). 

Do you sleep 8 hours a night? When was the last day you exercised? What does your diet look like? If a lack on control and inability to make the decisions you want to make is affecting your ability to socialize, focus on improving yourself. Go to the gym everyday at 8 or 9 am. See the same people each day? Go say hi. Friendships start with surface level conversations, but grow quickly from there. It sounds like you have a lot of negative self talk that is impacting your ability to connect in a variety of ways. You know how you can prove you are great? Set goals, and *then go out and accomplish them*. Ie, gym 3x a week, make or get healthy food for 5 meals this week, sleep each night for 8 hours, get my homework done with 24 hours to spare. Study 3 hours today. Small steps, achievable goals.

comment,"I'm sorry that it irked you or came across as blaming students. I guess I wasn't clear enough with what I intended and I apologize for that. The one thing it was not was disingenuous. I meant every word of what I wrote and have dedicated significant portions of my life to serving students. I care, deeply. So, a few comments to try and clarify what I apparently missed the mark on.

- I don't disagree with a lot of what's being discussed. I am one part of a big machine and I have no impact on (or even interaction with) other parts of the machine. When you talk about everything from mental health to PTS, I don't have anything particular to add to that discussion. I have one viewpoint on this, and I wanted to add that where I thought it had some value. Take that for what it is: one person's opinion, but one person who sees the institute from a different perspective than you, who had seen other similar institutes, and who is on the other side of one (and only one) of the issues in the OP.

- In light of this point, I want to make more clear that I'm not trying to blame students to say that the culture problems here are their fault. I'm trying to balance the comments that there is contributing behavior from the faculty (especially historically, but still today) that contributes with the comment that students also have something that they bring to it and needs to change culturally for this place to be healthy. There's plenty of blame to go around. Again, I'm trying to add one view that's unique from what the OP was able to provide from the faculty side of the interaction.

- I'm confused about your reaction to the topic of class sizes. I did not say that there aren't places with smaller classes (there definitely are, especially at the ivy leagues which are dealing with a scale of money we can never approach). I am saying that many other places have large class sizes (i.e., we are not unique in that). Look at Berkeley, Michigan, Illinois, etc. They all have large classes. I'm also agreeing with you that other places don't have the same attitudes, so something else is contributing to the feeling of isolation beyond just the class sizes. The comparison in resources between Ivy and here is night and day....totally different institutions. Our endowment is something like $2B. Go look up any of the Ivy's endowments plus their tuition (and then divide by the number of students they are serving at one time, and the socioeconomic class those students come from).

- Regarding my comments about the vast majority of professors caring about students: this is only one data point (my observations) and you may have a different view on it, but I will stand by that observation. I interact with a lot of faculty in different capacities at the university, and I would characterize very few of them as not caring about their students (as well as their research). Is that 100% true....no, not at all. Despite your quotes around ""all the professors care"", that's not actually what I said. I'm sorry that it sounds like your interactions haven't been positive. I wish you had a better situation yourself. We certainly have self-serving people on our faculty just like any other organization. What I can say is that I interact at a significant level with a lot of them and feel like I get some insight into their intentions. By far, I think most people (not all) are well-intentioned. I don't have a number to put on it like you were asking for. Qualitatively, I would say that I am surprised when I encounter people who I think don't care about the students. Maybe that's 10-15%? I dunno how to put a number on it, especially because there are different degrees of caring and how that's expressed. That doesn't mean we are going to follow you to your dorm to make sure people have friend or go the counseling center if necessary. We have a role to play in this system, and I am only speaking to that role. As I said above, there are other parts of the system failing, but I can't speak to that as they're beyond how I interact with the institute.

- I would like to point out what I'm not trying to say in the point above. I'm not trying to say that they're good at it. Student interaction is on the job training that we're all still trying to learn. As a whole, STEM people can be socially awkward and that applies to faculty as much (probably more) than others. As a population, faculty in STEM are not always good at recognizing people's needs, but it's not for lack of caring. Finally, you said something about them ""only teaching one course per semester"". The number of courses taught is not an indicator of degree that someone cares. I do have research responsibilities that I care about and am obligated to. I teach one course a semester so I can do a better job with it than if I were teaching multiple courses in the same amount of time. As one of my colleagues in this thread said, it's a zero sum game. We're stressed too. I'm often up until 1,2,3am working. I know you are too. I'm trying to balance it with my own family that I also have responsibilities to. We are afraid of failure and that failure has a real impact on us (like, our salary not being fully paid if fail at parts of our job, which has a huge implication on my family).

You are trying to attack me, and I guess that's your prerogative as well. Rather than this discussion happening in a vacuum, I was trying to add a voice that you may not always get to hear from on the faculty side.

comment,"&gt; I have almost no friends in my major because I don't interact with anyone in my classes for the majority of the day

Ohh boy. This is going to get me in trouble... But I made a decent chunk of my first Tech friends in those massive lecture-style classes. 

There is a way to survive this style of class, it's the same way you'd survive college as a whole: buddy-up. You don't have to wait until you don't get it, to try and quell your stress and then ask someone to be your study buddy. 

Would you consider yourself an introverted person? 
Maybe you're nervous or scared about talking to those around you. That's fine, but consider that interaction goes both ways. They may not be talking to you, but you are also to talking to them. 

Matlab, Diff Eq, Construction Law (at night of all times), and other classes of such, either from Day One if i knew it was going to be a doozy, or when the material started to kick my butt, I looked to the people next to me and asked ""What are you doing after class? Want to start a study group?""

I can understand that some classes do not create chances to organically interact with people. I am ""fortunate"" enough that I was in a major that seemed to thrive on making students ~~miserable~~ do group assignments.

I don't have strong opinion on what to change, but as someone that has developed some good relationships hopefully others will like reading about my experiences.

* I've always sat in large lecture halls with my friends, which is fun. I made a large effort to make CS friends shared my passions for the subject Freshman year by talking to as many people as I could in AI club (The Agency), hanging around the CoC (Not good unless you already know some people), and eating in dining halls with my majority-CS freshman squad. Since then, I've known people in all my CS classes, and I try to study with and around them as much as they let me. I know a lot of people don't study well without isolation, which sucks, but personally I find it much more enjoyable to be around people I know but can stay quiet with while studying.

* Since my CS friends don't want to do much fun stuff, I've had to find fun friends. At this point, that's my fraternity.

* Lower level CS class piazzas are lit. Honestly, smaller classes (other than Honors Discrete where the freshmen all have hardcore nerdyness in common lmao) had less people talking, both in person since they had less friends in classes, and on piazza.

* Most lectures I've been in are are pretty meh, from both lecturers and professors alike. HB was a bit of an exception, since she slogs so slowly through her error-filled powerpoints (which I guess have been improved, maybe?), there's no point in ever showing up. It's good to be able to learn from other resources like 2x speed videos like Vigoda's Algos lectures and /u/HFh and Michael Littman's Udacity videos.

* The only CS class I've had that's really on a curve so far was ML. None of my classes have felt competitive, and ones without active piazzas felt like people were just not thinking/caring about others.

* Apartment-style dorms are nice as long as you're in the majority that are renovated, but have jack shit in terms of community. I don't see this changing.

I can personally attest that this is not true. During my fourth year at Tech, I was able to see a counselor, provided by the institute, who with the help of CBT and some group exercises was able to change my mental state from one of paranoia and social anxiety to a healthier state where I was much more relaxed and confident around my peers.

&gt;No amount of culture shift will make you feel better

I would certainly have felt better during my final semester if a certain AE professor had not felt able to spend half of a 90 minute lecture yelling at his students for failing to understand his badly written test and threatening to fail us all due to a culture that penalized such behavior.

&gt;You are in control

Fair point. Dan is now on Mars.

Indeed, we should not be satisfied with being average. We should strive to be better than average.  
  
It's important to understand that throwing more money at mental health is not going to solve anything. Students are quick to blame the culture and the institute for their own problems, while refusing to go to the counseling center ""because they won't be able to see me anyway"" and refusing to seek help ""because we need a full culture shift for anything to change.""

My recommendation is to have the programs pretty independent of each other- so try to get classes that don’t overlap with prerequisites. Consider looking at what your major needs in terms of electives like a Technical Elective (for example, ChBE needs two Technical and Two Chem Electives).

You base the validity of something on its popularity? Ever hear of phrenology? How about eugenics? I imagine you're probably a huge fan of sociology, aren't you? 

&gt; People are arguing that if you want help, you can't even reasonably find it here in the first place. 

I don't know if I'd agree with that, never really dealt with the counseling center. I've seen multiple people make the claim that their experience with it was actually extremely positive though, so the anecdotal evidence of those who claim it to be supremely negative strikes me as a group of people who fall into the exact category that OP is aiming his discussion at. 

&gt; Which, if you connect the dots, means you're probably a bad person

Why am I a bad person for generally looking out for my own needs before helping other people; haven't you ever listened to an airplane safety video? I try to be kind to other people, certainly, but I'm slow to place expectations and reliance on them – that's called reasonable caution. What makes you feel that I owe you something, and that if I don't deliver, I am somehow lesser than you? From where do you derive your sense of entitlement? 

From an examination of your recent posts, it sounds like the unreasonable expectations you place on your fellow man have already kicked your ass once. Why aren't you open to the lessons that life is trying to teach you? Is your belief system so wafer-thin that it requires you to ignore the clear reality that is staring you right in the face?

&gt; judging from the upvotes

Is your argument truly so paper thin that you have to rely on an appeal to the masses to make your point?

Dont take your inspirational motivation from Reddit. Look outside instead. The real world is a lot happier than what you find here on the internet.

Reddit is here to vent stress. Arguments are a common form of venting. Some, probably most, can be viewed as negative. If one could harness the energy of the collective stress produced on a college campus during Finals week, we'll probably cure cancer and establish world peace.

In Reddit terms, if I were to take a step back, I would argue that /r/GaTech is simply circlejerking in the negativity. We certainly aren't getting a collective laugh out of it and the topics being addressed are serious issues but by posting negativity, the poster feels happier.

I name it the *Conservation of Happiness* where by the act of voicing one's concerns and letting off one's negativity out into the world reduces the internal negativity of said person, thus making said person ""happier"" by relative positive/negative balance.

That being said, the release of negative feelings is much like the toxic waste of any industrial process. It's a lot easier to simply dump it into the local stream (i.e. Reddit) than to filter, clean, and process it before releasing it into the environment.

Anyone not knowing of the contaminants of the stream before drinking from it will ingest the negativity and therefore become more negative.

Yes, one way to clean up the stream is having a metaphorical EPA come in and force factories upstream to clean up their act and stop dumping directly into the stream but the Government in this case are the Moderator team and I'll bet my theoretical degree in physics that they wont do anything.

That means if you wanna take a dip into the stream, suit up in your hazmat suit before hand or take a walk outside before your negativity dose gets above industry established maximum safety values.",Negative,"social media, mental health, venting, negativity, moderation",8,2018-12-06

comment,"&gt;No offense, I'm sure you care about students, but in my 3.5 years at Tech, I felt the exact opposite. I felt like the majority of my professors couldn't care less about my well being, or for that matter, my success in life.

So the funny thing is I was actually having a conversation with another faculty member about this topic today. Here's the weird thing, there is a strong correlation between students perceiving faculty as caring and better learning outcomes - but there is little/no correlation between faculty actually caring about students and better learning outcomes. That sounds crazy until you think about the implication...

Basically, what we have isn't a caring problem...we have a communicating caring problem. Students don't feel like we care, and in the end that is a failure on our part. That is our responsibility. However, it is also something that has become a narrative in the GT culture. In the end that means the default assumption is faculty don't care so we have to try EXTRA hard to build trust that we really do care, we aren't faking it. You see that in some of the nihilism and sarcasm related to open door day and other things - students, as a self-care/defense mechanism, don't want to give it much credibility because they feel like they have been burned by trusting the admin to actually care/continue to show caring so many times before.

The funny thing is I can think of at least two professor who would break your mind. One could not care less about students, but is a strong enough educator that his students believe, and act, as if he cares. He can communicate caring because he knows its part of doing his job well...but really he just wants to do research. On the flip side I know another faculty member who cares deeply about his students, and is TERRIBLE at showing it...partially it's cultural.

From the [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-tuVfcdRFU2JqxYfVN8nZP9M8YHgi2db/view) linked in another comment, the Pride Alliance and LGBTQIA Recourse Center wrote the bill to memorialize someone important to them.  Part of why SGA exists is to allocate funds to people and departments on campus.  Another large organization, RHA, also can pass bills for other clubs' endeavors.  SGA did not come up with that idea; they merely did their job.  

If you continue reading that document,  SGA has also approved bills for the Counseling Center to be more accessible to students (wellness app, 24-hour phone service, resilience training, etc.) and even an Intercollegiate Mental Health Conference.  There's also financial literacy training and the previously mentioned swing set, both of which I'm thrilled for after reading about them.

He told them he was armed with a gun, and he *was* armed with a leatherman, which looks very much like a knife in the dark.

comment,"&gt;I know it feels like you're paying a lot for tuition (because you are). I have paid it and am saving to pay it for my kids now. But at a place like this, the research funding is a fundamental part of the budget model. If I remember right, I think something like 30%+ of our income is from ""sponsored research"", which is more than tuition or state funding (which are both in the ballpark of 20% I think). That money pays for real things, including facilities and people that are valuable to you. For example, professors pay (depending on department and seniority) anywhere from 25-75% of their own salary off of grants because the tuition/state money alone isn't nearly enough to cover it. If the research goes away, we couldn't pay for many of the people teaching your classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the number last year was over $900 million in research expenditures at GT.

&amp;#x200B;

Overheard\* on those grants was 11% of the GT budget last year

Tuition was 22% 

State funding was 18%

\*Overhead is a fee that GT charges anyone who gets a grant to pay for things like power, janitorial services, IT, etc...basically all the basic stuff you need to run a college that does research.

Less tongue in cheek...part of the increase in lecturers, academic professionals, and professors of practice among other roles are because of a focus on making undergraduate courses better. They are hired based on their ability to teach well (or at least are supposed to be). They are paid to focus on teaching. It shouldn't be surprising they are better at it.

comment,"I've noticed you're consistently trying to twist my words; I've said that you can't rely on many people, and that you should look to ensure you own security before helping others, not that you should actively be malevolent against others. For instance, if my own career is in jeopardy, I am not going to be spend time worrying about yours. If it is you or me on the chopping block, it's not gonna be me (excepting close friends, where I trust them enough to work towards a third option). There is nothing inherently wrong with serving your own self-interests, until malevolence and greed enter the picture. You cannot  always give and expect to remain emotionally healthy; if you let people walk all over you, you will grow to despise yourself. A certain amount of selfishness is necessary for a healthy ego; too much, and you become an out-of-balance narcissist – too little, an out-of-balance doormat.

So I suppose that if you are seeking to be absolutely, truly selfless, then I am selfish. So be it, but I'd rather be a balanced, healthy individual than a man who constantly allows people to take advantage of me, using me until I'm all washed up. 

&gt; Clearly you have little desire, if any, to give anyone anything, so I don't expect anything from you.

For one, that is a lot to suppose about someone whom you do not know; I am quite generous towards my friends, and welcoming towards strangers. That said, I'm not going to blindly trust people or expect humanity as a whole to move towards some ridiculously harmonious pow-wow. My experience has been that people are generally nice to people they know personally, but suspicious and demeaning to those they do not – you are proving that point quite handily, by supposing that I am ""a bad person"", based solely off a few conversations over Reddit and your own preconceived notions of who I must be. 

&gt; Life is social, and I give to people to the best of my ability.

Would you give to me if I asked or demanded your assistance? How far does your altruism go? Will you allow me, a complete stranger from the internet whom you do not seem to like terribly well, to crash on your couch for weeks on end? 

&gt; I want to see our culture change to something more positive

To me, it sounds as though your first job was not a healthy experience; you expected that people would be kind to you, and instead, they used you up to point of a mental break. That's a wake-up call to be more assertive and treat yourself with more self-worth. It does sound like you finally came around, so good for you; but nevertheless, if you still believe in allowing people to use you, then have you really learned your lesson? 

Furthermore, it is incredibly naive of you to think that you can change the fundamental elements of human nature; our desire to see to our own needs first is born of billions of years of natural selection – we are all products of that. We can no more escape our nature than an ant can decide it is an individual; certainly, I believe that we are free, but our freedom is limited by our perspective. Whether you like it or not, that innate desire to further your own self-interest is instinctual and just as much a part of you as your fingers are. Perhaps you think that by publicly signalling your virtue on the Internet that you can further that self-interest and increase your social worth; given the kinds of circles you seem to run with, it wouldn't surprise if much of your social worth **is** based on how well you ""ownd that online fascist!!1!"". Regardless, the instinct to advance self-interest is an innate one, and you will gain far more from acknowledging your nature and seeking to work with it rather than blithely denying its existence. Denial only makes emotions stronger, as may or may not be evident to you by now; as an aside, I wonder whether this is why you are so driven to paint so many as selfish, because you fear that you yourself are? Only you know the answer to that question, and I doubt you'll be willing to truly think about it. Enjoyed the chat.

I find the sentiment that GT students are only looking to blame others for their mental illness repulsive. The students are pushed to their maximum and the help that’s advertised to them is subpar. The services at GT are rubbed in everyone’s face when tragedy hits, but when students try to get help they hardly get any. 

GT is a rough school and more than often the overworking, stressing and difficulty is glorified. I’ve seen it too often that it’s treated with a sense of pride, that our suffering is a sign of strength even when it kills us inside. It’s a culture, and I know that not just science students, but ID students experience it too. 

To sum up: People think suffering at GT is normal and the way to go. Those who suffer most efficiently are glorified. Less social students are even more vulnerable to this.

You can’t even begin to imagine the choices the police officer was forced to make when an obviously insane individual,who purportedly had a gun on him, starts advancing. Would you rather the cop have died? And before you pull some “shoulda used a taser” shit on me, tasers are relatively inconsistent, and very limited in range and reloadability. So, if Scout did have a gun and was in fact aggressive (as the call suggested) a missed taser shot = a dead cop. Literally not worth the risk in any universe.

The way I see it we have two cases:

Case 1 : Officer attempts to use taser
97% chance the cop survives, 100% chance Scout survives (this encounter atleast)

Case 2: Officer uses a pistol
100% chance the cop survives, 1% chance Scout survives

The life of an actively aggressive suspect is in NO WAY worth the 3% chance of the cop’s death. The cop did absolutely nothing wrong leading up to this encounter, so why should his life be on the line.

I'm not a physiologist/psychologist/brain scientist, so this explanation might be off, but the point isn't. The point of eschewing electronics while exercising is so your brain can subconsciously process things, which distractions like electronics inhibit.  A few years ago, there was an obit of a famous physicist who made ""discoveries"" while doing manual labor, and this was used as an example of this.  His personal technique was to go into his basement with nothing but a shovel and a light and move a pile of dirt from one side of the basement to the other, and while preoccupied with the task, his brain would be working in the background and realizations would all of a sudden pop up.

The BMED classes on the other hand are far more in depth, which a focus on topics that are more useful to pre-health student. Both are physiology classes in that they focus less on structure (anatomy) and more on function of systems in the body. 3100 is the physiology of macroscopic features in the body like tissues, organs, and organ systems, while 3600 focuses on microscopic features like the internal workings of cells.

Both classes are fun and contain an interesting-open ended group project, but the overall difficulty (and IMO usefulness) of the classes can vary wildly between professors. I can't speak much to different professors for 3100 but I would highly recommend taking 3600 with Prof. Dahlman over Santangello or Platt.

Even equating the two is a hard, hard overreach. If there was a random person making $60k sitting at home that could step in, be competitive (win games) and keep his nose clean (program integrity) then these coaches wouldn't be getting $3MM+. Look at Saban. He brings way more money into the school than they could ever pay him, making him, relative to that important ROI context, underpaid. A lot of coaches fit that mold, just not to the same degree in terms of dollars.

&gt;I just don’t understand why the school is ok with paying one person that salary when that money could support more people. A bigger team of coaches &amp; strategists paid healthy 6 figure salaries which sum to the same amount seems to me like an advantage.

Unfortunately in college football (or any level really) that would not be a viable strategy. What would the Catholic Church do with 6 Popes? Or a large multinational firm with 6 CEOs? You want the one guy with the master plan who's going to affect his vision and run things his way. Saban at Alabama has the luxury of also having an army of 6 figure assistants and analysts, but Bama just has way more money. Even then we have a very robust staff. The head coach has his coordinators (offensive and defensive), but they're subordinate to him. They get paid big 6 figures and have a much narrower view but still have some say in the strategy. Then you have position coaches, who work with the players of the same position on personal technique and microlevel on-the-field work. So in a way the team has a bunch of people like you're imagining (even the position l coaches, who are the lowest level of coaches, make 6 figs) in coaching roles. Then you have grad assistants, who are volunteers that work with the team in organization that are not technically coaches. You have your strength and conditioning coach and staff that direct workouts and nutrition. You have your player development staff, that are part of the AA. You have your recruiting coordinators and staff who are constantly researching, evaluating and building relationships with potential players from all over the country. 

The football team leadership is like an army. And just like any well-functioning fighting machine, there's one field general calling the shots for the colonels, the captains, the majors, the infantry, etc. And that field general position is the head coach's job and his alone.

Edit: I'll add to this that college level coaches are truly some of the very best *football* coaches around, at any level. We're only seeing the absolute pinnacle when we tune in to CFB games on Saturdays. There are untold thousands and thousands of coaches who never even sniffed a small time college gig (GT is in the top of the top division of CFB). These guys are supremely talented. And there's just not enough of em to go around.","Negative

comment,"Late response to this post but I figured more background couldn't hurt. This was funded through SGA's Joint Allocations Committee (JAC), which was created in direct response to Scout Shultz' death and allocates funds from the $1 million pot of money dedicated in Fall of 2017 ($500k from SGA, $500k from Tech Administration.) The policies governing JAC are found [here](http://jacketpages.gatech.edu/bills/view/2478), but briefly, there are 6 elected members (3 from UHR, 3 from GSS), 4 appointed members (2 by Grad SGA President, 2 by Undergrad President), and then the Grad and Undergrad Presidents themselves. We hear proposals from student groups and departments that further mental health on campus - anything over 10k goes to the Legislature for approval. Once JAC passes a proposal, the administration can choose to fund it or not from their side; if they decide not to, it can go to the Legislature for full funding. So in this case, SGA is allocating 5k.

[This proposal](http://jacketpages.gatech.edu/bills/view/2952) with reasoning was submitted by Pride Alliance. Everything JAC has heard before is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-tuVfcdRFU2JqxYfVN8nZP9M8YHgi2db/view). The cost is higher because it's a dedication though GT Development, which pays for the bench, upkeep over its lifetime, and allows a name to be attached to it. In every case, we aim to be consistent with what we fund. SGA approved the CRC's proposal for a permanent swing (purchase, installation), so capital outlay purchases are established by precedent. The committee agreed with the submitter that this would 1) formally recognize the tragedy of Scout's shooting, 2) soothe some of the pain still felt by many students on campus, and 3) still operate as a regular bench for students to sit and relax. To u/dobby_bodd's point, we did discuss the potential triggering effects of this bench, but also felt that it was important that we not forget the incident as it is still a driving force for change on campus (most significantly through Path Forward).

Any student can submit a proposal for funding for a mental health furthering initiative. The full process for how to do so is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lXTciS0um8yQxDRwbBInQHS-UfjZ2Xr7/view?usp=sharing), so if you have ideas for how to best spend this money, we really want to hear them.

As a general note, SGA very much could allocate funds to hire additional counselors, but we've heard emphatically that students don't want Student Activity Fee money spent on what should be an institute budgetary priority; also, it would only be a one-time purchase instead of recurring funding. We are currently pushing for that budgetary allocation and are exploring using JAC money to fund pilot programs for how to get counseling better integrated on campus.

Reports taken related to mental health &amp; wellness are posted in the non-criminal log. A recent mental health related event was incorrectly reported on our crime log. While it is true that these entries were removed from the logs yesterday, they were only removed to resolve the reporting issue as it related to the privacy of those involved in these sensitive situations. We have resolved the issue and have reposted all of the non-crime incidents that were removed.
 
We want to remain sensitive to privacy concerns of those experiencing mental health issues. We also realize that transparency is critical during these times. It is not an easy balance to manage, and we are considering how to achieve this moving forward.

comment,"Hot Take Riposte:

ID jobs are less stressful, all told, than production engineering jobs are, so there is less incentive within the ID program to acclimate ID students to high stress environments as a part of their educational training.

Elaboration:

If we deem it an objective goal to minimize the overall chance of suicide within an individual's life, then intentionally elevating stress within the 'safe space' of the academy to a certain reasonable limit, even possibly increasing the likelihood of suicide, may reduce the chances of a later suicide due to professional stress. If professional stress is less of an issue with ID grads than engineering grads, then there's less of a justification for elevating the stress within the ID program itself.

Discussion:

The ultimate question is whether the amount of stress within the engineering curriculum at Tech is justifiable. Any opinion on that question in absence of data is merely an opinion. I imagine an objective evaluation of this sort could be done statistically, were someone inclined to do so. It would probably take the following form:

1. Evaluate, perhaps through polls, the relative time obligations and stress levels of GT engineering students vs engineering students at other academies, using those other academies as a control group.
2. Evaluate the relative suicide rates of GT vs other academies. Control against two important confounders: gender and gun ownership. Compare to (1), to establish a correlation between academic stress and suicide rate.
3. Evaluate the relative suicide rates of GT vs other academies *post graduation*. Same confounder controls as in (2)
4. Make kewl graphs and shit.

I have no idea what the results of such an analysis would be, but I'd love to see it, were it done properly.

Personal admonition:

I went through suicidal phases in high school and a tiny bit as a freshman at GT. I would characterize the stress level of GT in my undergraduate program to be ""very high,"" probably the highest I've ever encountered anywhere. I didn't have any suicidal thoughts past the second year. When I entered the business world, I was continually taken aback by how much more easily I handled professional stress than my peers, and I've had coworkers comment on that. The easy response was always, ""yeah, this may be bad but at least this isn't Tech."" Never been suicidal since.

My school experience was in the 90s under a \~70% retention rate, so many of the people who didn't handle the stress well back then may have simply left or failed out, which may bias the pool of upperclassmen.

I do not know what ratio of my coworkers have ever been suicidal, nor do I have any experience with suicide in any of my workplaces, so I can't provide any useful anecdotes on that. And my own experience is merely an anecdote, not data.

* Bill calling on congress to pass gun control laws banning ""assault weapons""
* Bill calling on Georgia to legalize cannabis
* Removed funding for Marksmanship Club allegedly because of a leaked document saying that they faked some numbers in their request, but to my understanding this leaked document came from an SGA member and not from the club itself which is a little fishy (in the email regarding this, my representative said he did not feel that it was appropriate to fund this club in the first place)
* Rejected bill to fund an event about Israel, which would be one thing but they also didn't record this in their minutes anywhere or give a reason for why
* [Nate Knauf, one of the representatives for the CoC is a member of Democratic Socialists of America and is the one suing Perdue for the phone thing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/22/student-sues-sen-david-perdue-snatching-his-phone-when-he-asked-about-voting-rights/?utm_term=.b585b6c1820c)

comment,"&gt;With President Peterson’s annual salary of over $1,100,000

First off, this is a moot argument. As the president of a world class university, he holds an absolutely insane amount of responsibility and power. $1,100,000 is actually **much** lower than I expected. As a reference, the bottom 10% of publicly traded companies (most of which would be considerably smaller than GT in terms of revenue) paid their CEO's a salary of $878,000 on average as of 2011. ([Source](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/ilr.cornell.edu/files/workspan/02-11-Research-for-the-real-world_0.pdf)) The bottom 10%. There are a lot of very small companies in the bottom 10% of the stock market, so if anything Bud is being paid surprisingly little for his position, especially considering inflation since this article was written.

&gt;We must address that Georgia Tech’s curriculum is far more difficult and demanding than is necessary or reasonable.

Yep, thats the point. Ever wondered why we are #2 in Mechanical Engineering, #1 in Industrial Engineering, etc? You think you can just get a free pass to go to a stress free school and get one of the best possible undergraduate degrees awarded to anyone in America? That is just flat out ridiculous. This point is so overmade and is literally meaningless. School's aren't just ranked arbitrarily, the stressful curriculum of the school ensures that the best of students, both in academics and in ability to handle real work environments (stress), are awarded with a GT degree. Removing this aspect would render a GT degree much less prestigious.

&gt;Enfore Existing Reasonable Expectations for Coursework

I agree with most of the stuff you say here.

&gt; It is unreasonable to expect students to individually take on the added labor of maintaining their mental and emotional well-being when there are more time-sensitive needs to address.

Possibly the dumbest sentence in the entire letter. It is literally your body. Regardless of who's fault it is that you are mentally unstable, it is your sole responsibility to find the help you need. It's like saying ""It's not reasonable that y'all expect me to feed myself while going here."" (i.e. taking care of your physical wellbeing)

&gt; These conditions are not sustainable-- we cannot be expected to succeed if we are not fully supported as growing students and maturing adults.

Just a side note, its really weird that somehow these conditions are not sustainable, and yet probably 95% of students sustain themselves just fine and love the school.

&gt;Develop a contractual relationship between The Office of the Dean of Students and a mental healthcare facility to admit students for a flat fee paid by the institute for all involuntary and voluntary mental health hospitalizations.

Dont get me wrong, im sure many do and need to appreciate the gesture. But it teaches people to be complacent about their GPA and leads to a self fulfilling prophecy which goes on loop every semester, depression towards final weeks etc. Nothing ends up changing. 

To truly solve the problem lies at the heart of oneself, and I believe telling people that having a low GPA is okay is something that actually leads to self-degradation ""i cant be like that guy or girl no matter how hard i try so i should just let things be the way they are"".

 A lot of stifled potential comes with too much assurance and a lot of mental duress comes with too much pushing. 

At the end of the day, everyone is different and needs different solution. What i want to say tho is that this trend happens all too often, and for people to be truly happy about themselves they shouldnt have to be reminded everything is going to be alright every semester.

I personally had a low gpa and I couldnt learn to accept the fact that I had to be told having a low gpa was okay. It was so selfdegrading eevery semester, hence why Im posting this for those that feel the same way.

CS is very lucrative and requires little to no additional resources. You want to make something? You already have a computer and most software is free to use. Open sourcing (like github) makes it even easier. 

Most startups today revolve entirely around CS. 

Most hackathons revolve entirely around CS. (Some are business focused or whatever but CS is the obvious origin.)",Positive,"computer science

comment,"I don’t have time for the survey but if there’s a chance of taking some feedback here, I’m copying in elements of an old letter some friends and I wrote about campus changes.
     

The most important change that needs to happen to prevent more students from taking their own lives is to change the structure of the campus to increase student efficacy. Right now, most students hate it here. The feeling is that our work, our ideas, and who we are as individuals are completely insignificant to the school. We have no power, we are not heard, we are not empowered  to do what it is that we seek to do. 
     
1) why is there no gym, no place for physical exercise, in the heart of campus? There should be something where the student center is. GT is one of the only schools in the ACC that *doesn’t* have a fitness complex in the center of campus.      
      
2) Raise pay for TAs/RAs. It’s too expensive to build more full-fledged counseling facilities. Why not just raise everyone’s wages by $250/month so we can afford to pursue private care off-campus?    
    
3) Stop wasting money on things that don’t matter, like half of the new student union plans... why do we have huge cultural facilities but no general market to buy things like... you know... fresh fruit, vegetables, a place to have a choice (not just one) toothpaste, lots of school supplies, etc.   
    
4) Stop making us walk off campus to buy books. Yeah, I know we all just download the books anyway, but it’s really annoying that the campus “bookstore” is in tech square.     
     
5) Can we stop pretending that the faculty-student relationships here are okay?      
     
6) Add better-quality furniture, cover everything in whiteboards, the campus is currently 90% form and 10% function, if not even worse than that. Seriously. Most of the recently-built structures feel like ergonomically designed paperweights: expensive, serves limited purpose, pretty, and pretty useless.      
       
7) Increase the amount of money available for performance awards, for graduate and undergraduate research awards, by 25%.

Some people probably tend to become a CS major because they like computers/video games and want to make a lot of money, not necessarily because they have a passion for the material/work. In any challenging technical field, this is probably not the best idea. This may lead to resentment among some of the people in that category.

comment,"I appreciate the time you've taken to put together these thoughts, but I kind of disagree with them, especially in the context of changing campus culture.

1) The reason is because we have the big fancy CRC from the Olympics, and we don't really need another one? The student center is just that -- there's plenty of ways for students to gather and interact there. There's also Tech Green, where people are out playing frisbee or other games all the time. I don't think a fitness center is really necessary there.

2) I mean, sure, I'm a TA and more money would be neat, but that affects such a tiny percentage of the campus that it really would not make a difference.

3) Because we're in the middle of one of the biggest cities in the Southeast, so you can walk off campus in any direction and find those things at a store. I'd be kind of annoyed if new student center space was leased out to Walmart or something instead of something for the students. Fresh food would be nice, but just go to Publix.

4) Most people go to Barnes and Noble once a semester, max. And Tech Square \*is\* campus, officially. I don't think the business students think all their classes are off campus.

5) If you mean that there's a toxic amount of competition/grade problems/etc, then yeah, I agree.

6) I'm really not seeing how this affects campus culture in the slightest. My classes are literally in an old bank vault and we somehow make do. 

7) Again, I'm confused how this affects culture but regardless this affects very few students and doesn't significantly affect culture.

Put practice problems on your crib sheets instead of just information. Most of the problems on the final are the same with numbers changed. If you pick problems that you struggle on, odds are you'll a similar problem on the final and get it right the second time. If you're scared you're going to run out of room, use mechanical pencil and write small!

I don't know how much time you have, but actually skim the text book and make a one-pager for each chapter. Those will help you learn the more concept-based questions than the math problems

I want to refute a few of the rebuttles if I may.     
Specifically, starting with the additional money per month. Yes, it looks small, but no, it's not actually small. $250/month is on the low end of fees for private therapists that are any good. However, on the margin, I dare say the average tech student couldn't scrounge up $250-350/month for services. 
    
How does this affect campus culture: the more people are taking positive steps for their mental health, the more openly people will talk about things on campus. That will change stigmas about mental health over time where it matters most: classes and labs. I personally know people who have turned down ODS accommodation letters out of fear of retribution alone.

Regarding the CRC: the niceness of the building doesn't compensate for it's proximity to campus. Ive had bone cancer, it's not easy for me to walk across campus to the CRC, but I have to use weights (etc) for strength training. 
Open fields are not a valid point of comparison for a gym given the two serve different purposes (and some of the same). 

Most of us don't have time to go to Publix during the day. Not grad students anyway. Replace inefficient fast food with good food please. And for the sake of all that is good in this world, please don't let Walmart near campus. 
Can someone hit up trader Joe's about making a mini shop for us? That would be fire.    
     
Regarding the space: for the relative size of our endowment, the number of students, and the fact we are supposed to be a ""cutting edge R1 institution"", having classes where you ""make due"" isn't okay. I challenge your level of status quo bias here. Just because something works doesn't mean it can't be made better.

comment,"I was someone who was sucked into the CS hype my freshman year. I'm less interested in CS now, but am still graduating with the major along with my preferred major, Industrial Engineering. 

I still have a good appreciation for CS and enjoy using the things I've learned in the curriculum to supplement my work in ISYE, but I left it for my primary major for a couple of reasons. 

Majoring in CS is kind of like a greedy search algorithm. Insanely high payoff for little work early on, since you can just study a few coding problems online and find high-paying internships (around 2x, 3x pay than other majors) and high-paying jobs (1.5x pay than most other starting salaries). This is in addition to the clout of working for companies like Google, Facebook with a large media presence, where large companies in other fields largely stay out of the public eye. I'm not arguing clout is something worth chasing, but it is attractive nevertheless. Also, pay isn't everything, and I realized this pretty early on in my first internship when I was damned to front-end UI hell. The work wasn't intellectually interesting, and really repetitive. Even if pay was everything (it isn't), the pay eventually levels off as you grow in your career and I hear, though I don't have real numbers to support this, that business/management-focused majors outpace the salary of software engineers a couple years in. 

Some pros of not majoring in CS:

 - You might be more unique in your social circle for doing something different. This is a weak pro, but I kind of like it. 

 - You're largely removed from the toxicity that is CS recruiting. It largely luck-of-the-draw, but lots of people treat it like the company you work for defines who you are. 

 - CS is largely open-source in terms of learning and resources, meaning it's one of the easiest majors to learn about without spending your tuition. I can make no guarantees about your ability to self-teach. 

 - Maybe you would be interested in something else. 

Cons:

 - Lower starting salary

 - Weak con depending on the person, but you have less options to be in large cities post-graduation. Business majors might be excluded from this, but I know some majors are forced to look for jobs in obscure cities, whereas CS majors really can choose anywhere from SF, NY, Boston, etc. 

 - If you can't self-teach, you'll never learn this incredibly valuable skill that is becoming increasingly prevalent. ",Neutral,"computer science, major, pros and cons",5,2018-12-09

Sure, it is not as glamorous as being in a research lab, but can be challenging and rewarding work. I co-oped and then went full time into the paper industry. I'm only 3 years out of school, and I've lived in Richmond, Dallas, and now Charleston. I did research while at Tech as well, but I find this work far more satisfying. The dress code is really easy: jeans and tee shirts. I routinely get so dirty at work that I have to shower and change before I can leave. But the part I like best is sitting in the control room with a cup of coffee with the operators on a Monday morning talking about Saturday's football games. Like, here I am 2AM on a Sunday night at work browsing Reddit, drinking coffee, and talking about local news with two operators. We are in a boiler annual outage, and I got to be the night supervisor. :)

Keep your head up. While realistically, it may be difficult getting your gpa above a 3.0, there are other things you can improve to make sure you have a fighting chance.

comment,"Sorry in the delay on some additional explanation.

1. We should have been a bit more specific in that this is solely for the chance of black ice- not for snow/freezing rain/sleet.  

2. Others are correct that the residual wet roads and some runoff may be present when the surface temps fall below freezing.

3.  The temps should not fall below freezing tonight until 3-4AM and even then it will only last through 8AM. We're confident that midnight breakfast should be fine.

4. Although the dew point temperatures should fall quickly tonight, we don't have as much wind as we typically do on the backside of these lows, so it remains to be seen how much drying will take place before it can freeze.  This light rain/drizzle should end by 11PM.

5.  Overall, this is not on the same scale as other weather threats in the past.  The area will probably see some icy patches and folks traveling in the morning should take extra precautions and allow more time. 

6. Without an exam period in the morning tomorrow, it made sense to go ahead and delay the opening in case conditions do deteriorate.  Regardless, as soon as the sun starts shining in the morning, everything will improve.

7. Impacts to campus operations and services are being compiled and pasted to the main website at www.gatech.edu.

Finally, we're considering doing an AMA on campus closures, especially with regard to winter weather.  Please let us know if you'd be interested and provide suggestions for subjects to cover.

We'll be on campus early tomorrow AM checking roadways and pasting updates to twitter.com/gtpdalerts.

Edit: Just found some very negative student testimonials by searching this sub for “flipped”. 

Most of us students already have issues with procrastination and motivation when we have time specifically blocked out to go to lecture. Having it all online and learning on your own would imo just ruin motivation even more, and the comments I’ve read seem to confirm that.

Most people (myself included) would end up putting off the whole week's lectures until the day homework was due, at which point we'd cram the lecture recording while having MML in split screen.

comment,"I agree with some, I had posted lectures for my morning Dynamics class (summer semester as well so 2 hour long lectures) and usually I just wouldn't show up. Watching them and trying to catch up would inevitably take way longer than it would have been to just go to class in the first place because my attention span, especially at home, is terrible and of course I'd procrastinate so I'd end up having 12 hours or more of lectures to watch right before an exam. Not a recipe for success. Now it might work better for other students but I'd personally say I didn't care for it.

I also think the logistics of recording every lecture would be pretty insane. You have to have a videographer there controlling to camera as the professor moves along the board and in many cases, switches to the projector throughout. That's a lot of people you're going to have to employ plus most of the classrooms on campus just aren't setup for it.

If you record a lecture, you have to anticipate the amount of detail needed.

as a student, I'm allowed to record lectures (through ODS), and it helps with the fact lectures are not good for me as a learning style. So I do understand the argument.

comment,"Finishing up the third rotation of co-op here. I'll answer your questions based on my own experiences.

1. For a first rotation, you should have it verified before your waiver. That said, when you say verified, do you mean like you don't have an offer letter? In which case, I recommend calling/emailing your respective HR to ensure that's in place soon. I'm confused, because if they told you they were accpeting you as a co-op, they would need to give you an offer letter, which is all you need. At the very least, you should have an email/letter saying that they accepted you, and that hire-on paper work was on the way.
2. As far as I know, you should be okay here. As long as you have an offer letter and get the slip signed, you won't get penalized. I believe this applies to phase 2 as well, but if you want to avoid taking the risk, definitely get into contact with HR/your hiring manager.
3. I've registered my co-op phase 2, but it also wasn't my first rotation. It most likely depends on your advisor, but if you know it's a gauranteed position, I wouldn't worry too much about phase 1 or phase 2 stuff.

Again, I can't stress enough how important it is to **contact your company's HR.** If emails aren't cutting it, call them. They need to know the urgency of the situation. Additionally, **explain this to your co-op advisor** to make sure it gets figured out.

Also, [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis) may be basically viewed as the application of linear algebra to spaces of functions. Linear algebra is also used in most sciences and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) areas, because it allows [modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) many natural phenomena, and efficiently computing with such models. For [nonlinear systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system), which cannot be modeled with linear algebra, linear algebra is often used as a first-order approximation.

Inspired by the verifiable nature of blockchain technology, I'm proud to unveil Going Outside And Trying it Yourself, or GOATY. With GOATY, consumers can quickly and easily determine whether they can walk between two buildings in time.

This groundbreaking new product doesn't even require an Internet connection. Through the power of Your Own Fucking Legs (YOFL) technology, you'll be able to streamline the process, skipping posting on /r/gatech entirely and with guaranteed 100% accuracy.

This kind of innovation is only possible with the power of the Gech Cloud™, which will offer you shade unlike any other during the hot summer months of the beginning of the Fall semester. And unlike other clouds like AWS, the Gech Cloud is powered by renewable solar energy.

We're pleased to announce that GOATY, powered by YOFL and the Gech Cloud, is available starting today for just $0.",Positive,"innovation, technology, consumer product",70,2018-12-11

Overall Georgia Tech culture is kind of a mixed bag. On one hand, we have a complainer culture due to abysmal student services (transportation &amp; dining). On the other hand, I've met some truly incredible people doing really cool things. People *generally* take classes and academics pretty seriously. 

As for class sizes, again, take my experience with a grain of salt as I'm taking mostly intro-ish level courses (CS 1332 data structures, Calc 2, English 2, etc). I've found class sizes to not be a huge issues. Lectures are pretty big but my professors are still responsive to student questions and generally gauge the room. Recitations are usually much smaller with less than 20 students. As for the bell curve grading, I haven't had it happen to me, but I do hear it happens, especially with the upper level courses. 

The biggest benefits of coming here will be the amazing people you meet, and also the career opportunities. Lots of companies recruit heavily from Georgia Tech, especially for CS.

comment,"Honestly, the flipped classroom debate depends on the class. Most if not all of BME classes are ""flipped"" in some manner, but what we do (and what should be done to make it successful) is have a problem-based learning, or PBL, session. These are sessions where you go in and work in small groups to do problem sets with the help of roaming TA's and professors. It's similar to recitation, but more in-depth and for longer periods of time. We still have lectures, but usually, just one or two during the week and in many classes video or audio recordings are uploaded. 

I've also had an amazing experience in a flipped statics class. The videos were all on coursera and all we did in class was work on homework and ask questions as needed. If you didn't watch the videos at home, you could do so in class and ask questions about them. 

However, I personally have had an awful experience with the Circuits flipped class. The video learning style is fine, but having quizzes at the beginning of every class, before any TA or professor has even gone over the material or anyone has had the opportunity to ask questions was difficult. In addition, our TA didn't really care and we didn't have access to a professor for the entire class. It wasn't until the CIOS that I even learned we had one.

But the gist of it is: Flipped classroom and partially flipped classroom learning is a great tool, but not if there isn't any accountability for the students. Students, especially the 1st and 2nd years that would be taking linear algebra as you mentioned, have a tendency to procrastinate and then be upset when they can't get everything done. It is amazing at helping learn the material, if you actually participate completely. I do however think that linear algebra should have a recitation, as it didn't when I was taking the class, so I never learned if I did the problems correctly until graded homework. 

TLDR; it really depends on how the class is structured, how good the video or lecture learning elements are, and how good the TA is. ",Neutral,"education, flipped classroom, problem-based learning, video lectures, ta, linear algebra",2,2018-12-12

I'd recommend it if you've had interest in CS for a long time and at least have some good experience with algorithmic stuff (hackerrank, leetcode, projecteuler, etc). Also it's a much easier major for people who learn on their own. The lectures are pretty meh to outright bad sometimes, so you have a huge leg up if you can teach yourself new material on your own with persistence.

&amp;#x200B;

The one super awesome thing about CS is the internships if you take advantage of them early on. If you're really proactive and do a lot of research into what makes a good software resume, you can make great money at comfy jobs starting freshman summer.

GT's culture is ... interesting.  The best reference I have found on GT culture is actually this derogatory article from a Clemson fan page: [https://www.shakinthesouthland.com/2018/9/21/17883408/georgia-tech-love](https://www.shakinthesouthland.com/2018/9/21/17883408/georgia-tech-love)  Honestly the only issue I take is his assertion that GT lacks school spirit.  A huge percentage of GT students think of football as something that screws up traffic when they're trying to get to class, but I know of few schools where students are as proud of their school academically as GT.  The average GT student complains about how horrible it is, but they're unshakably convinced that they're better than you because they're at GT and the only reason you're not is you couldn't make it.

&amp;#x200B;

On the minus side, the complaints about student services probably aren't misplaced.  Most of the dorms were old when I was an undergrad twenty years ago.  The food is mediocre at best.  Professors are consumed by their research and classes can feel too large, especially in the core and intro classes.

&amp;#x200B;

On the plus side, the professors are frequently on the cutting edge.  The GT CS program is very highly ranked and I frequently talk to large companies who located offices in midtown to make recruiting GT grads easier.  At the grad school level students are collaborative.  That was true at undergrad when I was one, but that was forever ago.  For both class size and classes with high failure rates it's much worse in the 1000/2000 level classes than the 3000/4000 level, so transferring in misses a lot of it.

Gatech is very interesting in regards to the race situation. So like people everywhere, people are racist. It happens, and it's terrible. Constantly on gay dating apps, you'll see ""no asians, no femmes, masc for masc"" and it's on the borderline of discrimination (types are real, but the line for racism vs types is blurred imo). Gays in general think they can do this because they are already discriminated against.

The poc in the gay community can act the same way, only preferring white people. So if you're asking this question because you want to know if you can snatch a white boi, then who knows. Everyone is different and you might find one that likes you regardless of their race. But it goes both ways, you can't expect white boys to like your race and then you discriminate against your own race. You should own who you are and look past someone's skin color, you're only harming yourself and our fragile community.

But, if you're asking if the white gays are toxic and if they treat gays of other races badly, then you shouldn't worry, the gays on our campus are very nice.

The CS community is definitely more collaborative than competitive (this is one of my favorite things), save those one or two kids in lecture who try to one up everyone, as a result I don't really talk to them. There's a sense of ""we're all in this together"" and everyone's aware that everyone's super busy, no one's trying to pull fake shit to impress people by acting like everything's easy-peasy.

The grading system that you described (everyone's getting shafted, then we wake up one day and we got curved to A's and B's) definitely happen with many classes (less common in lower level classes), not gonna lie.

Currently, based on the median scores on each assignment we can approximate the median grade of the class to be 89. Now, that would mean for 50% of the class to get an A the exam average would have to be above 93. The average on the midterm was an 84 after being curved 20 points.

I would go with GSU, as its closer to GT and it will allow you to incorporate into the social life on campus (as you can go to big events) or simply come by and walk around campus for motivation.  

I don’t know how hard KSU is, but GSU is an easy school that’ll allow you to keep a high GPA to transfer over. Also, a lot of first/second year students are trying to transfer, which allows you to bond over a common goal. Another benefit of the amount of the large amount of first years trying to transfer to GT is that the advisors can help you create a good schedule that fits all of GT requirements, including the transfer credit equivalent. The downside is that there will be a little more competition to stand out in the transferring process, but that’ll probably be the same in any college in Georgia.

 The only issue is that the Atlanta campus isn’t that nice (it’s a bunch of buildings scattered Downtown), but it has its perks (good cheap food nearby, good coffee shops, no need for a car on campus, most first year classes are in same building). The campus doesn’t have a lot of common areas and green space, as the majority of students commute, that also means that weekends are pretty dull on campus.

I have been to KSU a couple times and their campus is better than GSU’s. I don’t know anything about their academics, but I believe that there are similar to GSU’s (specially during  freshman year). I have heard that it has a good social scene, and that being outside of the city allows for an easier commute. I have friends that transferred from KSU, and it was the same transfer if process.

The work load is so high that it’s almost impossible to keep up. The amount of reading and udacity videos the prof expected us to watch prior to each class was unrealistic, and the lectures made little sense without it. The assignments required a ton of coding, which wasn’t even graded, and the TAs couldn’t help with the code, even though some challenging coding was required if you wanted a halfway decent analysis. I spent so much time on this class and my assignment grades varied widely for reasons I don’t understand. On top of all that, there should be more prerequisites for this class.

comment,"Hey dude, 

Fellow transfer student. I transferred into tech with 45 hours and something like a 3.8 GPA. I heard the horror stories. I saw my sister struggle through her time here. I had many smirks when I told people I was transferring to Tech. I knew it was going to be hard, as you did too but that didn't make the transition any easier. The thing to remember is that you're here now so you have to make the best of what you have. Sure a 2.6 semester is a shit feeling but it also means you have a lot to build on. When I got my first sub 50 grade on a test at Tech, something that had never happened in my school career up to that point, I cried. I cried in class when I got it, I cried on the walk home to my dorm, and I cried on the phone to my mother. "" You have to pick me up, I'm not good enough, I can't do it, I thought I could but I can't"" The thing is, she didn't pick me up. I went back to class the next day and I got a plan for how I was going to improve my grades. It was hard and it sucked but every day at Tech since that fall has been easier. The thing that worked for me was to remember that you're not really here to have fun. 

You came to Tech (I assume) because you know the opportunity it affords down the road. If your life goals don't necessitate a degree from Tech, and trust me many many people who are at tech don't, then maybe it isn't for you and that is perfectly ok. If you do think you need a degree specifically from tech, then get a plan going for how to improve next semester. You can't change what's happened but you can move forward with a plan to do better. People bash this school for a lot of reasons but they really do have many services here aimed to help students like you. The more you take advantage of those services, the better off you'll be. 

side note: the people at tech are some of the most valuable resources.

I figured this was the best I could do, and it wasn't good enough.  It took encouragement from my friends at Tech to make me think maybe that wasn't true, and I reevaluated my study style (turns out I get more out of taking notes from the book at home than I ever did from lecture), but I eventually decided I was going to work my ass off and see what they best I could do really was, and if that wasn't good enough, so be it.

When I came back, the main difference was devoting time.... as much time as I needed (more than my peers, in a lot of cases). Staying ahead of material and taking the time to make sure you understand it is critical. This sometimes includes reviewing foundational material you thought you already knew.

comment,"&gt;I really struggled this semester where it seemed like others were making ""A""s so easily. Physics has never felt natural to me, so to see a passing grade is a real relief. 

In Richard Feynman's (physics Nobel Prize laureate) autobiography, there's this great part where he goes on sabbatical to work in a friend's biology lab for a year. The gist of the story is that he did pretty badly, constantly embarrassing himself by pronouncing things wrong, asking for things that didn't actually exist (like a 'map of a cat'), and eventually contaminating a bunch of someone's high-value samples with microbe-contaminated liquid. At the end he talks about how the most important thing he learned from doing it was how to open tubes with one hand.

In other words, you can be literally one of the best in one field and not great in an adjacent field. The important thing is that you committed to learn some physics even though it isn't public policy, and you absolutely succeeded at that. Now if only we could get engineers at Georgia Tech to care about the humanities and social sciences...",Neutral,"struggle, passing grade, richard feynman, physics, autobiography, sabbatical, biology, embarrassment, learning, open tubes, adjacent field, commitment, public policy, engineers, georgia tech.",32,2018-12-14

I would not wait to apply, coz CS is hard to get in and most of the core classes taken at gsu dont transfer to tech which means u hv to retake those classes at tech. So excel in this spring sememster, fight for 4.0 and get in this fall2019
Another reason of applying asap is that if u get rejected u can reapply for the next semester. 

Have heard ppl getting rejected with a 4.0 and accepted with a 3.6, so dont worry about it too much (but still worry about it)(just dont punish urself)
Do something which will differentiate urself from other applicants, go to hackgt and do other extra/co-curriculars. Show ur passion for CS. Get good letters of recommendations. Write strong essays, go to career fairs at gsu, try for TA/LA posts in gsu, build a resume.
CS is very hard at tech, so gt looks for candids who can tackle the classes and take the pressure.

If you just sit down for like 1hr/week in each class you will literally be fine. The only studying I ever do is required homework and studying hard a couple days before big tests and I have a ~3.9 right now.

You could absolutely make it through with a TI-36 Pro. I used that one in CHEM 1310 (as my main one was banned) and had no real problems.

That said, I personally used a TI Nspire CX CAS (that I already had from AP Calc) in 2211/2, and there were some things that it made easier. The ability to have the calculator work fully in variables sped up my test pace for symbolic test problems (probably the majority), as I wouldn't have to do the algebra myself. In 2212, it was helpful to be able to solve systems of equations at once (for circuits problems).

It makes me anxious and insecure about my own lesser GPA, since it's my body's way of motivating me to ""correct a deficiency"". But it doesnt last, not anymore.

I just have a 2.3 GPA, and my friend has a 4.0 - I also need to do work-study, and he does not. I also have a senior position reserved for me at a steel construction company, and he does not. He also got awarded a grant to his undergrad team to develop a pencil-test alternative for an aerospace company, and I do not.

He wants to get into MSE, and maybe be a researcher. I want my own construction company, and make my own buildings.

Comparing my GPA stopped being relevant to me, because it got me no tangible rewards. Walking up.to a job site got me far more reward than studying for a final. And, being the lazy shit-for-brains bottom-feeder ball of philosophical and chemical energy I am, I go for the easy route to my goals. It just happens, that goal is to make mad bank and build cool shit. 

Idk, asking your question is dependent on your motivations. GPA is a tool for academic prowess - no more, no less. If it's relevant, great! If not, also great!

Just, get some chocolate and give yourself a full 48hrs to sit with your thoughts. Write down some stuff, see what's relevant to your future self.

It affects what internships you might be qualified for and what general industry you’re more qualified for, but most entry level jobs aren’t going to be a full ramp up involving all the advanced concepts you’ve learned; it’s a gradual process to build reputation with your employer before you’re trusted with bigger problems.

You’ll learn more applicable concepts in your first months/year on the job than you’ll ever learn in college simply because you’re actually applying them to situations where there aren’t concrete answers.","Neutral

comment,"Fine. I'm not arguing that curves are better. I'm arguing they are a necessary evil when evaluating how comprehensively a student has learned the material of extremely difficult classes. For example, in heat transfer, the only way to test a student's understanding of forced internal convection is to give them a problem on it. If you studied hard and get the material, you can set up the problem, get a Reynold's number, and then follow the framework of getting a Nusselt number then finding h etc etc. But there are dozens of different Nusselt equations for very slightly different situations. These equations are long and easy to fuck up in your calculator. If there's a crossflow you have to calculate that too which has dozens of its own easy to fuck up equations. You have to pull half a dozen variables from tables for very specific temps and pressures, which sometimes have to be modified or interpolated. In this way, even if you follow the general steps and show understanding of underlying principles, there are dozens of difficult to avoid sources of error and you will likely get a completely wrong answer despite knowing what you're doing. By nature of the material any problem comprehensive enough to test real knowledge is also insanely difficult, too difficult to expect an ~80% average. There's no version of the problem where that's possible. The teacher didn't teach it badly and I didn't learn it wrong. It's just fucking hard. Therefore, curve.

I don't hate you cause you're a dumb freshman, I am annoyed with you because you're not understanding or acknowledging the limits of your own Tech experiences.

comment,"Not saying things can't be institutionally improved, but I do think a lot of the culture shift needs to come from students. Personally, I haven't every felt severely victimized or prisoned by Tech. I balance my academic involvements with other stress-relieving things I enjoy doing-- dancing, hanging out with friends (of different majors too, so we don't default to talking about classes), going out, playing sports, working out, cooking, watching movies, etc. I actually still love going to school here, despite how shitty PTS is and how stressful school can be; it's balanced by some of the greatest times in life, also thanks to GT.

The thing I want to stress here is that it's a **proactive** **effort** on our part, as students, to balance our own lives. Yes, the institute can handle grading better so we're not failing classes until the end, only to have it curved 50 points. We shouldn't be pitted against our peers in an effort to be in the top X% of the class. I agree, and we should fight for that. In the moment, however, that's not going to change. At the end of the day, you're in charge of your own happiness. So make the decisions you need for yourself. Solve the problems around you-- create the next. Or just say fuck it, it sucks, find a way around it, and take the inconvenience as a cost for something greater you appreciate.

Go join another organization--change something up in life. Keep it exciting. If you hate your classes but feel like you'e stuck in your major, just involve yourself outside of it. If you enjoy them, good for you! It'll still be stressful at some point, but once you take a test, just learn from the experience and move on. Don't dwell on the past. Talk to your friends, vent, get the frustration out.

Every single thing isn't gonna be fun in the moment, but I believe that you can find a balance that works for you in the long run.

comment,"That's a good point. I came from out of state, so I never had to worry about losing a scholarship I couldn't get anyway.

As to talking to professors, I established 2 good relationships in my time. One was with my physics professor freshman year (Ed Greco, not sure if he works there anymore), and I sat in the front row of his class, paid attention, and asked/answered questions. So when I later went to his office and told him I was interested in doing research with him, he was very receptive. With the second professor (Lei Zhu, at the end of sophomore year), I literally just looked up some of his research and sent him an email asking if he had any undergraduate opportunities, having never previously spoken to him. I think I was the only undergraduate who had even asked him in some time, and he was happy to hook me up. It ended up being pretty difficult research to contribute to, since he didn't have an infrastructure in place to help undergraduates, but I did 3 semesters worth of research with him, took one of his grad level classes, and I got a nice letter of recommendation.

So I'd say just be direct, even if you haven't spoken to the prof before. Just tell them you want to do some undergrad research, and they'll probably at least engage with you.",Positive,"undergraduate research, scholarship, professors",3,2018-12-16

comment,"Yeah for heat transfer it's also impossible to learn all the concepts. Sure, it sounds easy to learn conduction, convection and radiation as overall concepts, and they're not hard to understand generally. But the breadth of problem types is staggering. Convection on a flat plate involves a totally different set of equations to convection of a fin heat sink, or a rectangular tube instead of a round one, or a rough surface to a smooth one. Radiation eqs are totally different for gray vs black surfaces or different shapes. Conduction eqs are totally different for a hollow shelled cylinder vs a solid one or a series of concentric spheres or 2d conduction in a plate. All of them are fair game and totally different animals. Impossible to completely master all of it. Exams are open book because you couldn't fit all the potential eqs you need even if you had 5 crib sheets.

This is where you not having taken a class like it makes it hard for you to understand. You do get partial credit, and that's why you can scrape together a 40 instead of a 0.

What's your argument them on classes where curves are definitively not necessary? I mean I'm still here in easy lower-level classes, but multiple classes that I am taking are being curved simply so that the professor can get the grade distribution looking how they want it.

Don't let this idea deter you. Come see campus for yourself!  There are tons of programs to take a look around and get to see what goes on here, from campus tours (I'm a tour guide do this one!!!!!) to different events for prospective students.

comment,"This is probably a less popular opinion, but I think campus stress levels have increased tremendously during my past 7 years here as an undergrad and then grad student. I don't think it's just students complaining on Reddit. Perhaps it has more to do with Tech's relatively quick increase in the quality of the average student. Compared to when I first entered, admissions is now more selective, SATs are higher, high school GPAs are higher. Students are used to being at the top, and I think part of the stress comes from trying to maintain that status in a really talented student body. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, it also very largely depends on what the standards you set for yourself. I did my undergrad in 4 years and graduated with a 4.0. I sometimes regret trying so hard because I have so few fun memories at Tech. Pretty much everyone in my little overachievers circle feels the same... we're glad to be done, and we're proud of our work, but life here was not fun.

comment,"Time management and sacrificing the amount of free or fun time.  You need to go to class, pay attention, take notes and then review said notes on a regular basis. Homework should be started early and you need to be fully vested.... Get through the work and don't forget about what you've done it what you've learned by doing the work as soon as you've completed it. Take time to study outside of normal course work.    The problem with GaTech is that you really have to take your academics seriously, which can stuck because it's also college which is probably the last time any of us will be young, surrounded by young peers and relatively unconstrained in terms of station,  responsibility,  obligation, and/or expectation.  Don't get me wrong, life can get way way better after college if you play your cards right... But the ability to live within that kind of vibrant, sheltered existence and environment is typically ephemeral.  Even if you can, most folks can't/won't maintain it for very long.  Life will track you down and take you to account.   

What happens is trying to decide upon what how to decide what balance of work, discipline and faith that your efforts will push you towards a better future is acceptable and can be maintained and how to manage the adverse effects (less fun, fewer opportunities for non academic experiences, more stress, danger of letting work become your life and achievement the only sustenance for ones self esteem).

There are other important lessons to be learned during this stage of life, and the rigor at Tech can stunt growth in other areas.

This is the source of the stress.  There isn't enough time in the day/week/month/semester to do it all without putting yourself at risk of burning out....and for what?  An internship that may or may not matter 3 years from now?  A slot at a company or in a program that someone else might have lucked or schmoozed their way into (or past).  Research that might set you up for major successes for the next phase of your life?   

A good GPA (or lack thereof) is like money.  It won't necessarily make life easy having it, but in se.circumstances not having it can lead to more obstacles between you and your goals.

My advice...if you do not have a good GPA, then use your hustle to make up for it.  Find part time work or internships or research or personal projects and work and network your way towards your goal.   People can and will sneer at a GPA all day... It is more difficult to shrug off or disregard the tangible fruits of one's labor.  If you get into the habit of being a self starter then you'll rarely want for a direction in which to move forward.

The truth about gathering information online is that there is an immediate selection bias. Nobody who's not stressed is going to go online talking about how not-stressed they are. I can only say this - in the 90s it was very stressful. Everyone I graduated with had these:

In Tech's favor, I'll say this: It doesn't hurt to try it out and see. You can always quit/transfer if you don't like it. I know a lot of folks who failed out of GT and were still tremendously successful.

SOUP is for students who can’t make it to campus over the summer. It’s a fully online course vs. a flipped classroom.

&gt;Why is there an Online Masters in CS and Analytics then ?  Are you saying they are implemented badly ?

No...I’m saying most flipped classrooms are implemented badly. Fully online courses like OMS and SOUP are different and can go well, but most students here value an in-person lecture more since it’s what they’re paying for.

You don’t come out knowing those things, but you know how to apply the degree, interplolating that boron should fluctuate with time, steady pumps won’t change power levels, heat removal is necessary, and can merit a guess what will happen with a new fuel type based on geometry and composition.

It was also implied that we're talking about GT students since you're in /r/gatech asking why GT hasn't implemented recorded lectures in GT classes. 

MIT OCW is popular for a variety of reasons; college students may use them as a supplement to their own lectures (but honestly I haven't seen any students here use it), or people who aren't even college students use it to learn more, etc.

comment,"Hey! I took ISyE this past semester. I don't know what the other sections did, but mine started off with basic probability axioms, independence, conditional probability and all the formulas that follow them. Other big, more specific ideas are law of total probability and when to use it, Bayes' theorem (this one isn't really important because it's easy to derive but memorizing the formula makes the problem easier). Get really good at the card problems. Get to know those well (at least understand the concepts) because pretty much everything after is gonna be built off of these basic ideas. For example, you learn in the first week that the formula for conditional for event a given event b be has happened is p(a and b)/p(a). Later on, in a more difficult case, you would need to use the law of total probability to find p(a) and you need an understanding of independence to find p(a and b). Also, there are different ways to find the probabilities depending on if it's discrete or continuous, joint or single variable. 

&amp;#x200B;

So after learning the basics, you move onto random variables and different distributions. There are two kinds: discrete and continuous. The big ones for discrete are bernoulli, binomial, geometric, poisson. Continuous: exponential, continuous, gaussian/normal. With each of these, learn how to identify them when given a scenario (don't worry, after a few practice problems they become really easy), calculate conditional probability, calculate the mean/expected value and the variance (learn the identities and formulas. Discrete has a different way to find these than continuous), find the cdf. For discrete, you need to learn how to find the pmf. Continuous: pdf. Continuous utilizes integrals so if you're not the best at them you should review basic ones. Smaller topics are markov's inequality and learning how to approximate upper bounds, approximating binomial with poisson, approximating bernoulli with laplace. 

&amp;#x200B;

After single random variable, you move onto joint distributions and basically do all the above. It's an extension of what you've already learned. Needless to say it gets a little trickier in joint distributions, especially continuous with all the double integrals. You learn about covariances. Towards the last few weeks of class, you learn about the central limit theorem and how to use it.

comment,"From the perspective of how learning works, simply listening to a lecture that was given in a class is not a particularly effective approach to learning. At best, you will be able to get something into your notes that you missed the first time around. At worst, you will think it's a replacement for the face to face version (thereby missing out on a lot of communicative cues that feed into your ability to learn), and you will mistake familiarity with the recording for actual understanding and learning (also why you shouldn't just review your notes over and over again to study). Overall, when learning in an online/recorded setting, simply listening to a recording is a subpar way to learn.

What you *should* be looking for are support materials from instructors to supplement your learning. A text book, access to videos or other content that covers a particularly difficult concept in a voice different from your professor's, practice problems that you haven't seen before, access to office hours to help when you're stuck, homework assignments that help you build your new skills, and so on.

So I can see why you might think that having lecture recordings available might be a good thing, but it actually turns out that they aren't the real answer, and most times are not likely worth the resources it takes to produce them.

Plan on seeing them Tuesday -- rumor has it that some of the processes take hours to run.

Tuesday it's Financial Aid's turn to recalculate eligibility and adjust awards -- that can't be easy or pleasant.  Think nice thoughts about the Fin Aid staff!

If you didn't get one or you never received an email saying you were denied, you will probably have to try again next year. There are usually hundreds of applications per class, so even hard let alone to get an interview. If it's the case you didn't get a response at all, make sure next semester you get recommendations from current TAs from the course; that'll put you higher on the list. 

If it's the case where you've already interviewed, they usually don't send out offers until the next semester starts unfortunately; it's pretty annoying, considering that you might have gotten settled in to your schedule or phase 2 may have ended, but the reasoning I've heard is that they never know exactly how many students they'll have and hire retroactively.

In return, I want faculty to understand the pressures of students and why there is so much pressure to perform academically, and how it can really distort our view of the importance of grades. Yes, grades aren't the most important, but it's difficult to separate yourself from that when everyone is saying that if you don't have a 3.6 or above GPA or five internships then you'll never get out.

In addition, I want GT to start admitting that we have a stress problem. A part is definitely the students pressuring themselves, but there is almost a perverse culture of taking pride in how far we can push ourselves or break the students. This is a research university, but imo there should also be more consideration and advocates for doing your best but not at the expense of your mental health.

I know that last point is pretty hard to do, pulling people away from super high salaries and such, but we just have so many talented people at Tech. I think Tech would benefit from having a School of Education, or at least a Masters of Education in like STEM or CS specifically or something (or even a minor in Education). It might help destigmatize going the education route from Tech, because some people don't want to ""downgrade"" and go to GSU/UGA/etc after Tech to get teaching credentials.

In addition, setting mini goals for big, somewhat daunting goals is really helpful. Like one goal you might have is ""get research next semester"". So a few mini goals would be ""Look up at least 5 professors you might be interested in doing research with, and narrow the list down to 2 professors by looking at their recent work"" or ""Email professors asking for research"" or ""Look up and apply to two labs before spring break"".

You might not get several for one reason or another, but, with persistence, you're going to find something.  A 3.1 GPA is hardly a disqualifying factor for either of those things.  I know that it never feels good to get a C, especially when you've gotten good grades previously in your Tech career.  Give yourself 2-3 days to beat yourself up over it if you need to, but then it's time to move on - last semester is over and you get a clean slate now from which to build yourself.

Also, just a heads up, even if you don't get into grad school, your future is not bleak.  You'll have an EE BS degree from one of the best engineering schools in the world.  You can get a really well paying job and, after a couple of years, your company will probably have a program to pay for you to go to grad school if you still want to.  In that case, you end up with the same degree without having to stress about funding: a win-win.  There are always paths open too you other than the one you initially envisioned, and you have no way of knowing what the ""best"" one truly would have been.

As for the interviewing, almost everyone feels nervous and messes up during interviews. I think it helps to prepare doing a mock interview with another person just because it will help get you out of your comfort zone. Having a real person there will make you more familiar with how to calm your nerves and present yourself the best you can. I have the same problem and practice helped a lot.

Also, you don't have to feel bad for venting. You're right, it might help some people to know that others are going through the same things.

The good thing about being in your 20s or about to start your 20s is that you got all the time in the world to finish up Tech and do the other things in your life... eventually. It doesn't matter if you get a GF when you're 18 or 21 or 23, it doesn't matter if your first work experience is this year or next, you'll eventually do it.

comment,"I got out so I can't speak for 2110 officially anymore, but in the past we didn't really send rejection emails. There's just too many dang applicants you know? Like a hundred. I didn't at all when I was hiring for this semester.

However the new head TA is a better person than I am and did actually send rejection emails to the people who interviewed but didn't make the cut.

With the exception of classes like 2050, which apparently hire without interviews sometimes, aka they'll like yolo at the beginning of the sem if they need somebody, I would say that if you didn't get an interview by this point (end of the sem) you probably didn't get it. However I don't think it would hurt to email the head TA if you're really curious, we wouldn't have minded or would mind at least.

Honestly dude if you didn't get it, please don't feel bad. TA hiring is a total crapshoot. It's largely based on TAs' gut which is wrong a lot. Like some TAs almost don't get hired but turn out to be amazing. Others get hired, top of the queue, and they are... _not_ amazing. Getting a TA job is not equivalent to being capable of TAing well, in other words, and even if it were I hope there's a class that clicks with you. 2110 was that class for me, I love it.

comment,"Currently a freshman so maybe my experience isn't as valid, but to my knowledge, time management skills are what will end up having a huge impact on whether or not you have a mental breakdown.  Most of my friends who had mental breakdowns or were dying of stress had packed way too much on their plates.  I'm talking 4 extra curriculars, 2 of which tacked on outside work commitments, and tried to balance a social life outside of those clubs as well.  The others having panic attacks were those who were ultimately unmotivated or feeling depressed because of non-academic things such as not feeling any accomplishment in life or having a good network of friends, but this ended up tanking their grades and just adding on academics to the list of things to be depressed about.

I'd say it's also about finding the resources you need whether it be academic help, a social network, or even therapy sessions and being able to manage your time and have self control in an environment where attendance isn't necessarily required and where procrastination is so much easier.

Ultimately if you feel like you were an academically strong student in high school, you probably have the mental capability to do fine in your classes, but it's a lot of the other things that dictate whether or not you actually will.

Hope this helps.

I was in these shoes at GT. It takes work, but you can get past it. 

Put yourself in situations to talk in public as much as possible. In a group project? Volunteer to be the presenter when discussing updates, presentations, etc. Search for a student organization where you feel comfortable talking about a topic you know about, and use that to gain comfort and trust in public speaking. 

Newborns don't come out of the womb being comfortable talking in stressful situations. Everyone has to coach themselves on how to work around or over it. 

I also adopted the approach of public speaking [following President Barack Obama's speech patterns](https://www.inc.com/wanda-thibodeaux/want-to-be-a-brilliant-public-speaker-take-a-cue-from-one-of-president-obamas-qu.html) - don't be afraid to stop or pause conversation to search for the right word or flow. If you find yourself stuttering and stammering, test out changing out your speech process by being more measured in how you formulate your conversation. You could even test this out in an online game or in a low-stress situation where social anxiety cues may be lessened. It works wonders in interviews.

You can do this. ",Positive,"public speaking, comfort, confidence, coaching, strategies, tips",2,2018-12-18

[Here's the policy](http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/policies/grading-gpa/grade-substitution/) on freshman forgiveness. The main things to note are that you must fill out the form before next semester ends and retake the course before your fourth semester ends, and you are not eligible if you were caught cheating in the course.

Now, as for tips for how to succeed when you retake it:

1. Start the homeworks the day they're posted. This is the best tip anyone can give for 1371. As you now know, the homeworks are miserably long and tedious. Start them ASAP and use Piazza liberally. If you aren't sure where to start, try drawing out the described process in full (including edge cases, which 1371 loves), then convert that to code, piece by piece.

2. Go to Kantwon's lectures or at least use his lecture notes (you'll have access to them even if you aren't registered for his section if you didn't notice). For tests, you'll be at an advantage next time because you'll know what kinds of questions to expect.

You probably already know this, but 1371 is not a class to neglect if the material doesn't come naturally to you. I believe you'll be able to make it next time, so don't let it get you down too much now!

comment,"-from a 6th year- 
I changed my major twice, had to withdraw in 2016 due to a mental health crisis, and was finally anticipated to graduate this semester. 

Turns out, I didn't pass two classes. Tried pulling it out at the last minute, even had a devoted group of friends pushing me constantly at the end to grind and get out (they even made a GroupMe for that sole purpose), but was only successful with two of my other classes I took this semester, or so it appears based on my current transcript - still fighting to have one of those failing grades rounded up. 

There is a lot of shame I'm dealing with, because a lot of people were expecting me to graduate. I even walked across the stage at commencement and shook Bud Peterson's hand, all while feeling like I shouldn't be up there because I already knew I had failed one class. 

I'm dealing with feeling inadequate as well, despite other evidence pointing to the fact I am.

My advice is coming from someone in the middle of it. There is a difference between knowing something to be true, and actually believing it enough to let that knowledge affect the way you think and act. Plenty of people can tell you their ""best"" strategies and techniques for studying, for sports, or for life in general. I doubt any of them follow them 100% of the time. If the professional football players on the Falcons roster can lose the Superbowl after being up 28-3 and still sell tickets to their games the next season (the pain is gone, the memes continue), you can fail all your classes and still come back next year and kick gluteus maximus. That's what I learned from dropping out my 4th year, coming back after a semester break, then earning a higher semester GPA than any semester prior to that. I wish it hadn't taken all that to figure out what I'm doing and how to do it. But somehow, life is still amazing in a lot of ways. And guess what? This year, I failed again. But you know what? I may not have become better at school, I may have forgotten a lot of the stuff I learned, but after writing this and processing what has happened, I think the problems I'm dealing with aren't as big as I've made them to be.",Negative,"education, mental health, graduation",1,2018-12-18

Further, the professors are not entitled to know the details of the situation requiring accommodation, merely what logistics / accommodations must be made.

Like the above says, you should contact an academic advisor (I assume) ASAP.  Presumably you'd like to do that before they leave for the holiday break.  I don't know when that is, so I'd try to make an appointment sooner rather than later.

comment,"Ive never done drugs or alcohol, but I do have a problem with very low self esteem and an inferiority complex. At times, it gets to the point where I question the validity of my own existence. I've not been diagnosed by a professional, so whether it's depression or not is uncertain.

A lot of the time, I keep wondering if I'm even employable/""worth-it"". My GPA is high as well, but I haven't gotten any internship offers yet (not that that's relevant to one's worth as a person).

My advice, which should be taken with a grain of salt, as I am not a mental health expert, is to take ""baby steps"" to get rid of your addiction. Focus on quitting a bit at a time. For instance, try substituting an alcoholic drink for a short exercise session (exercise has been proven to improve mental health). Then, if you still crave other drugs, substitute something else for them.

Additionally, if it is possible, find a way to get other mental health professionals to help. If it's too expensive, ask a group of friends or acquaintances. The great evil of depression is that it attacks one's self worth. So, let it be known that I, and the countless other Gech denizens, care about you and your self-worth. Thus, I highly encourage you to seek help and get rid of this illness.

That's all I have right now. Hope it helps!",Positive,"mental health, self-esteem, addiction, depression, exercise, professional help, support.",23,2018-12-19
comment,"Hey op, I'm really sorry to hear about your depression and addiction. I haven't dealt with substance abuse myself but I do have unhealthy habits I turn to in order to hide from my depression. It's been on and realllyyyy on for about 6 years, and I'm only now confronting my issues (major depression, empty feeling, self harm, suicidal thoughts). **My first suggestion is to tell someone in your life**. I finally told my parents a couple months ago that I've been depressed for a while and needed a therapist, and I told my friends and boyfriend about the stuff that goes on in my head. It's really helped having people to talk to, even if its uncomfortable at times. Taking that step has also kept me on track and honest about my progress since they ask me how I'm doing and what I'm doing to improve my situation. Tell your parents you need help of some kind. Just be honest about your struggles and hopefully they'll focus on helping you. I think having a therapist could help you since you seem to trade off one addiction for another, and possibly rehab if you think the situation warrants it. Unfortunately telling people who aren't invested in you isn't going to pay off ^(and GT isn't invested in our mental health), which is why you should talk to the people you're close to.   


Also, you need to cut out the enablers in your life. If someone is still pushing you to smoke or drink, especially if you tell them your situation and they keep doing it, you need to drop them. It's toxic and you don't need them to drag you down when you're already down. Delete your dealer's number. Throw away anything that has to do with drugs and alcohol and don't give yourself a way to get it again. Be honest with yourself and the people around you. This admission is a great step towards and healthier and happier life, but it doesn't end with just posting about it. Take solid steps toward finding your happiness, and if you ever want to talk please feel free to dm me.

comment,"Hi Pete, former student and CRC employee (not a lifeguard) here. I think I can shed some light on the situation. 

There is a general lack of accountability when it comes to CRC student employees. Our bosses consistently do not punish offenders so people consistently goof off. Unfortunately, this includes showing up late and closing early which leads to inconsistent hours. 

Though, I would argue that the lack of accountability is calculated on the part of our bosses. The CRC does not have enough employees so firing bad apples is off the table. Also, throughout the semester the CRC continually bleeds employees who find better jobs elsewhere. 

Throw in the fact that 75% of the workforce disappears over break and it becomes a surprise they attempt to keep the pool open at all. 

All the issues are magnified for the aquatic center because it is, with out a doubt, the most mind-numbing job on campus. When people are swimming, the lifeguards cannot talk or have headphones in. Just sit there, stare at swimmers, and have the same trash-pop music rotation echo through their brains. 

I am sorry the CRC can't fulfill what it promises. I wish my coworkers and bosses were more conscientious.

That's a really succinct way to describe depression. Too real.

I've taken a couple cracks at proper therapy but both did not turn out well (didn't mesh well with the Therapist). I tried to make 3 visits to Stamps Psychiatry this semester but only got to sit down for 1 (long story short - some of the staff there are pretty disrespectful of your time; the two out of three scheduled visits I didn't ""attend"" both involved me sitting in the waiting room for 25 minutes beyond the time my session was supposed to start and eventually walking out). I may try to revisit counselling in the future.

1. Cut out your enablers. Someone already mentioned it and its great advice. This is my brother's largest pitfall and it has caused him to relapse several times now. It might be hard to cut those ties, but its step one really.

2. Get back into your hobbies and start new ones. For real, pick up a sport like running, weight training, disc golf, etc. It gives you something to focus on.

3.  Don't have cash on you. This is one I think my brother picked up in rehab. With a credit card, someone can hold you accountable to your purchases. If you're carrying around cash, its impossible to do that.

4. Set small goals for yourself. Little victories get the ball rolling on your overall war.

What's the point of being in college if it's for a fake education? I might suspect it's for the GPA/degree and high paying jobs. But even with that, it will be hard to move up the ladder if you don't have the knowledge GT provides you. Knowing the material goes way further than a GPA in getting jobs. With all this, I believe in the end, it might be a better use of money and time if you just tried to learn and pass classes yourself.

If nothing else, because of the way high school works now, fewer students are actually taking all the weed courses everyone used to take that destroyed GPAs.

Now, it seems that most of you are coming in with a lot more than that, and having (believe it or not) an easier first term (the literature suggests the first term matters a *lot*). 

I'd love to see how the number of hours / term has changed over time. I didn't take fewer than 17 hours until I was a senior by credit hours and even then I was still taking 5 - 7 courses (I got out with three minors (or the closest we had to minors back then)) a term.

For third years it becomes a lot more difficult if you're planning to graduate in four, and you'd have to ask GT cadre about specifics.

If you're international, your visa status is going to be a consideration.  Sorry.  If you have a valid work status be sure to communicate such early and often.

comment,"I had an internship summer after freshman year and it was hugely beneficial to me. It's definitely worth exploring the opportunity to do one. That being said, it's gonna take a lot of leg work on your part, because careerbuzz isn't going to do much for you here.

Go out and apply to things. Personally reach out to startups. There are internship opportunities out there, it's a matter of finding them. Usually after freshman year you'll have better chances at smaller companies. But really, when it comes down to it, there is a decent chance that you might come up empty. That's okay, and you really shouldn't be too disheartened if that happens. It's not expected that you have an internship after freshman year, so you're not falling behind or anything.

Finally, my last piece of advice is in life, but especially while at GT, don't bother comparing yourself to others all the time. There's almost always going to be someone better than you at something, and accepting that is important.

Also, get your resume reviewed by recruiters specifically.

There are also other factors at play - someone may have had opportunities in high school that you didn’t or just have parents that are well connected. That is just to say that you shouldn’t take it to mean that you are in any way less because you don’t find something. Most people don’t have a whole lot of marketable skills related to their major after 1 year and that is perfectly fine and normal.

That said, there are sometimes programs that specifically target freshmen and sophomores, so I’d try to apply to those if you really want to find something. Even with those though your odds are pretty slim since there will be so many first year applying with nearly identical resumes.

I always suggest studying abroad the summer after first year. That way the summer doesn’t go to waste and it’s usually the best opportunity for study abroad since you probably will want to be working in future summers.",Neutral,"internships, opportunities, skills, study abroad",7,2018-12-20

comment,"**3 helpful hints:**

If you look at the National Center for Educational Statistics you will find that every year there are just over 1.2 million Masters/PhD graduates in the US. 

(this will get you started: [https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017136.pdf](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017136.pdf))  

You are not only competing for jobs with this group, but also with active employment seekers with similar credential AND real life experience in the roles...  So the question becomes, *""How do I market myself to the firms that are doing interesting work that I would enjoy doing?""*

**Advisement hint #1:**  ""my GPA is okish..."", i can code less ""decently"" blah blah blah... your brutal honesty here tells HR managers that you are NOT the person to hire. You need to reign in your self-criticism and be bullish about yourself.   who cares how good you are at application""X""... what you are good at is learning applications, tools and turning that ability into actionable and revenue generating gains.  I will guarantee you that in any workplace you walk into, you will NOT know all or any of the tools needed... but you can damn well learn anything...and quickly...and not only that be willing to teach others.  Play up your strengths and your ability to contribute to a team and provide exceptional value and service to your employer.  This is what HR managers want to hear.   Not that you suck and PML5 programming.  If they ask you about VBA it is safe to say you have functional experience with the tool...  no need to volunteer your harsh opinion of your competencies.

**Advisement hint #2:**  Research the companies you are going to interview with.  Know what is currently going on in their press releases.  Know the names of their officers.  Know their products and what they do. Know their core values and activities they sponsor. Address your hiring managers by name and anyone else you meet by name.  Find a scenario where you could fit into what they are doing and how you can help take them to the next level.  Be that positive  energy that tells an HR manager that if they hire you they will not regret it.  You must be interested, informed and can provide value... you WILL stand out and this will often get you a second interview.

**Advisement hint #3:**  Make multiple resumes.  I start with a primary generic resume that is good for posting on broad based job search engines.  I try to focus on key search words.  Keep the language about what you can do and not what you can't do.  For skills that you have a bit of exposure to but could pick up with a few weeks of really focused hard work don't be afraid to include these skills...  You can say ""Familiar with Natural Language Processing Algorithms...even when your real experience is with other Machine Learning processes and you only have a basic familiarity with NLPA tools.  A Masters or PhD means you have the ability to learn what you need to know quickly.   

For jobs that I really want to dive into I will create a custom resume for each job application tailored to that specific job.  Say for instance I really want to do bio-medical research, I would then really tailor my resume to those critical skills and experiences that I have  that strongly align with what they are doing.  I will focus on bio-statistics and research methods. I would push less relevant skills down and move the key and critical skills to the top.  Most HR managers will have a stack of resumes on their desk and they are only looking at the first page of every resume.... make sure your targeted skills are easily spotted and recognized. This will prevent your resume from being tossed to the side as not having the desired skills in the initial screening process.

Perfect. Now walk backwards.

There is no possible way to determine whether a college football coaching hire is the right hire other than win loss record, in the eyes of the people who hire and fire the coaches, because the perfect coach who runs into a stream of bad luck is going to be kicked to the curb, while a horrible coach who runs into a stream of great luck is going to get a raise and an extension. This is baked into the nature of college football fans, who are the people who buy the tickets, which produces the money, with which we pay college football coaches. They do not differentiate between being lucky and being good.

So for college football, it is literally impossible to determine who is a better coaching hire until you see what the wins and losses look like, because that is literally the definition of ""better coaching hire."" It is tautologically true, because it can't be untrue, because of who evaluates what amounts to a ""good football coach.""

comment,"&gt;There is no possible way to determine whether a college football coaching hire is the right hire other than win loss record

Then why bother with going through a hiring process? Why not just pick someone off the street, let them coach a season, and determine if they get another season as coach based on that? After all, if this is *the only possible way* to determine it, there's no reason to go through this arbitrary bullshit of interviewing a hiree, checking their references, evaluating their history at other programs, etc. 

If anything, Stansburry is just blindly wandering through the darkness of coaching without any indicators as to who the right person to hire is. I mean, you *could* evaluate candidates based on an interview and their history and their references, but by your *expressed words*, that has zero bearing in determining whether or not someone is the right hire, so why bother?

In fact, let's go ahead and hire you as our head football coach. Bye Geoff, you're out: /u/Beej67, you're in - after all, there is literally no possible way to decide who the best fit for a program without throwing them into the gauntlet and letting them do their thing, so it could very well end up that *you* are a better head football coach than Collins, right? We just have no possible way of knowing beforehand! We'll give you three years to turn the program around, and only after the fact will we know if we made the right decision. Best of luck.

We'll tune out anyone who has an opinion that hiring some reddit user is not a good decision. If Ken Seguira asks Todd Stansburry why he hired a reddit user as opposed to an actual professional football coach, he'll say, ""We can't know for certain if it was the right move yet. We'll just have to wait and see.""

Wes Durham questions our reasoning and logic? ""We'll see.""

Mark Bradley thinks Georgia will stomp over a program without a head with any experience? ""We'll see.""

Jeff Schultz wonders if this spells the end of GT football for good? ""We'll see.""

***

You see how absurd you sound? If someone offers their opinion on whether or not Durham is the right hire or not, the response is not ""we'll see"" - people are more than capable of evaluating Georgia Tech's decision based on the factors that are available in the present. Tech made what they felt was the right decision without knowing with certainty what the future held, only that based on these factors, the future appeared best with Collins. Other people can offer their opinions on how that prediction might hold up, but if you say, ""we'll see"", you're setting yourself up to fall victim to [Hindsight Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias).

Tech has the tools to make a decision from their available options. Someone else is capable at looking at what tools Tech had available and judging Tech on their ability to use those tools properly.

comment,"PTS' goal is to send an email notifying all effected customers 48-72 hours in advance of any impact to their parking. This is more important when we truly need the space cleared and less so when we can cone the spaces off and/or work around the vehicles. In W25's case, we coned the spaces off the night before and worked around any cars that were already there.  As a result, the email from Wednesday was really intended to keep customers informed so that when they showed up the next morning and cones were all over the place not to be surprised and/or to move the cones. We did not cite or tow a single car.

In cases where citing and towing is needed (i.e. Georgia Tech Football Games) we will not only make sure we meet our 48-72 hour email deadline but we place No Parking signs in the areas, and post notices on social media.  If we have to tow we make every attempt to contact the customer first (via text, email and/or phone) to move thier vehicle before actual towing occurs.

Approximately 3% of all of PTS’ revenue comes from citations and towing. Believe me I wish it was zero but unfortunately, it is a necessary evil.  Enforcement is a critical parking management strategy that is needed to ensure that parking regulations are followed.  This ultimately leads to a more efficient parking system for all.

As for the request and graphic, PTS received both from Faciliteis much later than what is printed on the document. My guess is that the date is when the document was created.

I happen to think that Geoff Collins is probably the best hire given our current situation *with the fans and boosters,* although if they weren't in play we would probably have better in-field results stealing Monken from Army.

But that opinion *literally doesn't matter,* because the hire will be evaluated based on whether he succeeds or fails, and on no other criteria whatsoever. What you describe is a good, objective rational position that makes *no difference in the world of college football*. Take, for example, George O'Leary and Chan Gailey. Were Chan coaching against Donnan at UGA then Chan would have won well over 50% of his games. George had the benefit of coaching against Donnan and won three of five. George was a ""good hire"" and Chan was a ""bad hire,"" literally because of their records, not any other reason. And not only that, literally because of their records against Georgia.

I'm sorry to say I don't know much about neuroscience at Tech, but I think the opportunities that Tech has to offer definitely outweigh a slightly lower GPA. We have events like UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunities) which is a research fair where research labs showcase their work, and try to recruit interested students. If you play your cards right, then you might even be able to secure a research position as a freshman. 

Again, I don't know the details for grad school for neuroscience, but for CS at least, GPA wasn't the only important thing. All of the schools I applied to wanted to know my work/internship experience, research experience, personal motivation, and of course what my professors thought of me (recommendations). GPA is only one part of the equation, and it's not always a bad thing if it happens to be a little low. Most grad programs expect at least a 3.0 GPA to be considered though, so if you're really worried about Tech's program and think that you can't keep at least a B average, then it might be worth thinking about other schools.

The problem is, you can't really gauge how successful you'll be at Tech until you've experienced it yourself. I made it out with around 3.2, and I had to work my ass off to get it. Others I know barely studied, and got nearly perfect GPAs. Anyways, best of luck in admissions, and I hope you'll consider Tech for your undergrad studies!

comment,"To clarify what IceColdy29 said, [the policy](https://registrar.gatech.edu/alumni/readmission#two-or-more) is that you will be considered to have left Tech (requiring readmission to continue) if you do not take classes for two or more consecutive semesters (incl Summer).

Registering your internship overrides that rule for the semester you're interning. For summer internships, it doesn't matter, as you'll resume classes in the Fall (only one semester away). But most people don't take classes during the summer, so if that's the case and you intern in Fall or Spring, you'll be missing two semesters, triggering the rule.

Some scenarios where registration isn't necessary outside of Summer:

* Study abroad over Summer &gt; intern in Fall -&gt; Registration **not** required.

* Intern in Spring &gt; study abroad over Summer -&gt; Registration **not** required.",Neutral,university policies,4,2018-12-20

I hate to be that person, but going by the course syllabus, mse3005 seems highly related to coe3001, and having taken 3001 twice unsuccessfully leaves a lot of doubt that you are ready to take 3005, much less alongside 3001.

comment,"&gt; Right now, at 3:07 PM on December 20, 2018, Geoff Collins was a good hire.

No. Right now, it *looks* like a good hire. Whether or not it *is* a good hire will be determined by results. If you disagree, feel free to tell me what the exact probability is that Coach Collins will beat Clemson in next year's opener. You can't.

The fundamental flaw with your analogy is that *a coaching hire is not a lottery ticket*. The lottery is a purely probabilistic exercise, in which every single individual play has an independently equal chance of winning. College football is not based on random chance, it's an imperfect meritocracy. 

When you're playing a game based on pure probabilities, hindsight is useless. That's because of the inherent independence of such probabilistic events. However, hindsight is *not* useless in a meritocracy, it is essential to evaluating past decisions and rectifying mistakes.

&gt;Five years from now, he will still have been a good hire because Tech effectively utilized its available resources to select the best football coach at the time

This is absurd. By your logic, there is no such thing as a bad decision that only seemed like a good one at the time. If it seems good at the time, it is a de facto good decision. We all know that this is false. Sometimes a bad decision only *looks* like the best one. That doesn't make it a good decision.The fact that something *appears* to be the best decision at any point in time does not mean that it is *in fact* the best decision. 

That's why every business in America collects data to retrospectively evaluate their own past decisions. In a game of chance, decisions are evaluated on pure probability. In business, decisions are evaluated by results. If you aren't re-evaluating your business decisions based on their results, you are an idiot.

If Geoff Collins goes 0-60 over the course of five years, that would definitively prove that it was a bad hire. In that scenario, anybody who maintains that it was actually a good decision simply because we had limited knowledge at the time would be rightly viewed as a fool. It's entirely possible to make a bad business decision while thinking it's a good one, and the only way to find out which is which is with results and hindsight.",Negative,"coaching, decision-making, probability, meritocracy, business, results, hindsight.",0,2018-12-20

comment,"The Office of Information Technology’s Cyber Security unit has identified a widespread email phishing attack and identify theft scam that targeted approximately 8,800 students, faculty, and staff at Georgia Tech. Cyber Security is working with impacted parties to ensure the integrity of their personal information is preserved following the attack.

The original message was sent to Georgia Tech recipients Saturday, Dec. 15. Throughout the day, Cyber Security received several reports of suspicious messages – all of which had varying subject lines and messaging but encouraged recipients to participate in a car wrap advertising scam. The sender falsely promised easy money to individuals who agreed to shrink-wrap their cars with ads for popular brands. The purpose of this scheme is to solicit personal information from recipients and con individuals into wiring money to scammers.

The following information was requested from the adversary:

* Full Name:
* Residential Mailing Address (Not PO BOX):
* City:
* State:
* Zip code:
* Country:
* Car Make/Model:
* Telephone numbers:
* Average miles driven each day:
* Have you held a VALID US license?

The suspicious email reports were ultimately traced back to the same [gatech.edu](http://gatech.edu/) email address, which appears to have been compromised in a previous phishing message. The compromised account was immediately reset. Cyber Security also alerted recipients of the attack and encouraged them not to reply. 

Some individuals have, since, notified Cyber Security that they did reply with personal information and may have attached signed PDF documents in their responses. The unit encourages anyone who has done so to contact its Security Operations Center immediately at [soc@gatech.edu](mailto:soc@gatech.edu) and also report this incident to [IdentifyTheft.gov](http://identifytheft.gov/) at [https://www.identitytheft.gov/](https://www.identitytheft.gov/).

comment,"That's not the way they used to do it. You used to be able to call in. I don't know for sure, but here are a few possible reasons: 

Reduce no-shows. People are more likely to follow up if they've already put in some effort. Their resources have been so low for so long, that it was a waste to have unfilled time slots if someone no shows. Likewise, no matter how strongly students were told to come early to do the paperwork, most of them didn't. So, much of the initial consultation was taken up by paperwork, which 'wasted' up to 1/2 a session. 

If someone is in crisis, they can walk in and be seen that day, any time. It's more efficient for the people in crisis, but less efficient for everyone else. 

HIPPA compliant software for online communication regarding medical records is f*$%ing expensive. Keeping the records online isn't so bad, but transmission of info can be a problem. 

People would say over the phone they needed an immediate appointment, and then would come in and - granted, they felt horrible, but it was not an ""emergency."" Some people would call and not ask for crisis appointments when they truly needed them. People need to be triaged, and it's not ethical to ask the receptionist to triage callers for psychiatric need. They can't pay a therapist to be a receptionist. If a therapist is answering calls, s/he is not seeing clients. 

Finally, there are some definite unsolvable problems, and so they are just flat out doing something different because something needs to change. Sometimes you just have to change something, gather data, and see how it works or doesn't work. 

I hope that with the new resources promised, that they can fully staff crisis hours and regular eval sessions properly. 

If you are on campus for class or something else, try to find an errand in that direction. Then, at least you can drop in, fill out the paperwork, and have your next 'obligation' all set to go. 

Good luck. ",Negative,"changes, efficiency, crisis, medical records, receptionist, therapy, resources, staffing, campus.",3,2018-12-21

- You're not homeless if you have your dorm room; With minor agreements with housing, they can treat you like students who don't go home for the holidays. You can continue to shower, work out, access some of the best internet in the world, keep the lights on, and more!

- If you failed your last semester and have any proof to show for it, doctor's note form the health center, etc; it is sometimes possible to have the school discard the semester for your gpa. *this is easier if you ask for help before the end of the semester though. Though importantly, school isn't everything; and failing out is okay, you have still attended Georgia Tech and have some meaningful knowledge no matter what you do.

Legality of enforcing the 'exact match' law is itself probably doubtful. It was struck down by a District Judge in November. Obviously will go through further appeals but Kemp's rules are hardly settled law.

A more compelling fact is that Kemp also purged 340k voters for a 'change of address' that didn't actually happen. That seems hardly legal to me. Especially ahead of his own run for governor.

&gt;Stacey Abrams wanted every vote to count, Brian Kemp wanted every legal vote to count. There is a difference.

Just gonna throw it out there that voter fraud is ridiculously rare in the United States and is mostly just exploited in-name by the GOP as an excuse to purge the votes of certain demographic groups likely to swing Democrat. There is a reason why Trump's voter-integrity commission was disbanded after years of searching for mythical 'illegal votes' in California and subsequently turning up with nothing.

comment,"When I visited the Stamps psychiatrics literally bawling because my anxiety was unmanageable, I got a very unsympathetic response of welp, you can get some therapy in 4+ weeks (getting anti-anxiety meds prescribed from Stamps was also a nightmare and I got the run around so it never happened...). Walked out and never was able to get in, proceeded back to unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with my anxiety.

Fast forward 4 years to me at my grad program at a different school, the same scenario occured where I showed up to their mental health services bawling. I got diagnosed with panic disorder and PTSD (the psychiatrist at stamps gave me no diagnosis and did not even bother trying) and the meds I needed the same exact day. I was in therapy and also seeing a psychiatrist within days of that. I am happy and healthy now, but definitely not thanks to the mental services at GT.

comment,"Chances are you will be taking required transfer courses in your spring semester. So they will need to wait until after your spring finals for those grades. They will accept spring grades - just have your university send your spring transcript to them automatically in May once finals are over. 

Also I know people with 3.75+ GPA’s who got denied (and one with a 4.0, but i’m unsure how believable his story is). Average transfer GPA is a 3.7 for 2018 - so a 3.3 would make the bare minimum, but I think even 3.3’s usually don’t get accepted. I would say if you’re transferring from a hard school, a 3.3 is worth a shot. 

Finally I’ll say this. If you can barely keep a B average at your current university (which I’m assuming was less rigorous to get into than GT), odds are you will be having a rough time at Tech. I’m not saying you’ll do bad if you came here, I just want to put things into perspective if you haven’t already. I have lots of buddies who never really saw it that way, just as “once i’m in thats all i need”. If you want to prove that you have what it takes to transfer, you should work on getting all A’s this semester: 1. so you can prove you can put in the effort and 2. so you can raise your GPA to maybe a 3.5 and have a shot at acceptance.

Maybe also Kalamata?). All of those also accept Buzz and Dining. 

With the current meal plan options, it’s not a significantly better deal to get X amount of swipes versus spending the same amount on pure Dining Dollars (aside from the freshmen options, if one needs that much food). (It may be a better value if you eat more on East Campus. Swipes are worth $10 at West Village where food is more a la carte, but they’re $14+ at the buffet style dining halls) 

As a result, I’ve just gotten Dining Dollars for the past few semesters. I sometimes cook or eat frozen dinners, and the $600 plan lasted all semester. There’s also a $400 option that  has the 10% bonus. They expire at the end of the spring semester.

comment,"Be aware, GPA depends greatly on major and which professors you get. Also, you won't know until you get here if something like lecture classes really isn't how you learn. (It's not for me, to the point where I am a B/C student in them if I take more than 6-8 hours that semester). I don't know much about neuroscience, but I know the science-based majors tend to have higher GPA's than the Engineering based majors. 

I see a lot of people on here saying how us complaining isn't something you should take so seriously, but for some people coming to Tech really can be a huge adjustment. If you went to a smaller high school, a high school with a weaker stem program or are very young (under 18 at the point of entering college), you might want to be more cautious, as these things can suggest that you are too confident about your current skill level, as compared to Tech's curriculum.

Also, since neuroscience is new, we don't even know if we have a strong program here. They could just take a combo of the BME and Bio major classes and make them brainy, without a true neuroscience focus. 

Overall, Tech looks good for Grad school. But, if you don't do research you won't get in. If you are really concerned, look at the research opportunities in your field at the different schools you are considering. 

And at the end of the day, know its ok if you come to Tech and become an A/B/C student instead of the all A student you once were. Tech is great at providing you with the skills you need to be excellent in your chosen profession. And always remember, B/C students are often better in the working world than all A students.

Plenty of people that are pretty wonky live by microdosing LSD daily even. Your problem is the depression. You're just self medicating, and it just isn't cutting it anymore. Going into rehab to fix a ""drug problem"" will only make you infinitely more depressed, because you're going to be cutting off everything you've been using to make yourself feel half decent. Go to a counselor and please please please work on the depression WITHOUT stopping your drug regimen first. Kratom and pot are great for people that want to live functional lives.

&amp;#x200B;

This is coming from another successful GT student with plenty of vices that sound far scarier than any you have (I won't name stuff, but definitely in the category of hard drugs), so hopefully you can trust my opinion. For real, the drugs are not the problem. Either way, you're in a medicated world. Unless you go through the insanely slow and painful process of working through whatever problems you may have, doctors will just fill your brain with serotonin (SSRI's) for the time being. Try SSRI's for a bit maybe. They worked well for me when things were really bad by just taking the edge off of everything. While doped up and in a livable state, work on the underlying issues you have either with a counselor or by self reflecting, because it'll be slightly less painful with the medication. If you have to go to the counselor high to make any progress, that's what you have to do. I don't open up to people unless I'm not fully there mentally, so don't feel bad if you're the same way.

I actually failed out of the community college I started at when I was on pharma prescribed medication as a freshman; there were other factors that went into my lack of success (shitty home situation, environmental turmoil, lack of discipline etc.) although after I started smoking and had a really intense trip on LSD I had a lot of changes in perspective that motivated me to go back to school. I applied for grade forgiveness at the community college and brought my GPA up to a 3.7; I applied to GT and got in. I'm here now with a 4.0 after my 3rd semester, and I have to say that some of the things which helped me most with my depression and lack of motivation were the exact drugs named here. I bust ass all day and come home and smoke weed and have a nice meal; it really helps me destress and honestly I find nothing wrong with that sort of reward system, even if it is technically self-medicating. I do think it's smart to take tolerance breaks, and also important to be wary of where we are getting our daily doses of dopamine.

All of the curriculum in the course is on par for fundamentals that can get you started on the right foot in industry. One word of advice would be to seek out practical applications of the concepts so you can speak about them with relevance in a job interview. No one is asking about Shannon's theorem but tons of interviewers would expect you to know the inputs to calculate bandwidth given a certain channel condition. 

I took a class with Akyildiz on networking and sensor networks that set me up pretty well for my first gig.

- Prep for the material before each lecture so you can actively participate in clickers. They are only helpful if you know whats going on.

Other than that, this is all good advice for getting an A in the class.

Also, actively participate in the lab whiteboard problems. They're actually pretty good for learning how to solve the types of problems that'll appear on the test.

comment,"I will admit that the naming convention for the different networks across campus can be a bit confusing. We're working on consolidating the naming and back-ends of the systems to hopefully make it less confusing.

/u/GTWreckTechs is correct in their response. LAWN is the ""Local Area Walkup/Wireless Network"" across campus. That includes eduroam, GTother, and GTvisitor on the wireless side in all campus and residential buildings. On the wired side, LAWN refers to the general-purpose wired network that exists in places like Klaus, Clough, College of Business, the Library, and other places with publicly accessible wired network ports that aren't managed by one specific department (outside of ResNet and EastNet) .

""ResNet"" refers to any network in the residence halls, including (wireless) LAWN and START. START is the wired network in ResNet and EastNet, similar to Wired LAWN elsewhere on campus. It has its own subnet and VLAN assignment as well as registration system that's completely separate from LAWN.  

Eduroam, GTother, and GTvisitor (as part of LAWN) are the same networks across campus including ResNet and EastNet. There is a pool of VLANs that are used for Eduroam that are assigned based on a hash of your username. Once the hash is computed, any of your devices should get assigned to the same network regardless of where you are on campus.

If so, why should i even need a static/reserved IP address to run a web server, other than the fact that the setup would be simpler? Is it not still doable with a dynamic IP address?",Neutral,ip address,1,2018-12-26
comment,"&gt;By saying that I get a reserved IP address, do you just mean that I get a static IP address?

Short answer is yes.

Longer answer: A reserved IP address is much like a static IP, but there's an important distinction. DHCP reserved addresses are still assigned dynamically by our network equipment to your device but you'll get the same one every time. Static IP addresses in the usual sense are hardcoded into the customer's device(s) - doing this on ResNet will _not_ work and will result in a loss of all network connectivity.

&gt;If so, why should i even need one to run a web server, other than that fact that the setup would be simpler? Is it not still doable with a dynamic IP address?

Registering with ISS disabled (and therefore getting a reserved IP) also opens up the campus firewalls to allow other devices (both on and off campus) to connect to your device's web server. If you leave ISS enabled and therefore get a dynamic IP, only device that are also on the same START network will be able to connect to your web server.",Neutral,"ip addresses, reserved addresses, static ip, dhcp, network equipment, device, connectivity, web server, campus firewalls, iss, campus, off campus, start network.",2,2018-12-26

The way I see it, we weren't going to hire another option coach because it does hurt recruiting and a lot of the fanbase was sick of it. The Clemson OC was probably the ideal candidate, but it was going to take a lot to convince him to leave. Collins is solid defensively and he's done a fine job leading Temple, but more importantly are the things he contributes outside of X's and O's. He's from Georgia and has recruited for Tech in the past, so he already knows how to sell the school. This combined with increased finding from the AA for more dedicated recruiters should help with the talent gap between us and the other ACC schools. He's also young, energetic and by all accounts is a coach players love to play for. He's already done a great job of appealing to the fanbase and getting many of them back on board. 

By no means is he going to turn us into the next Clemson are suddenly have us competing for a national championship, but there's no coach that could do that. I think he is going to be able to have us consistently compete for the Coastal (much like CPJ) and at the end of the day that seems like a realistic expectation for Tech. 

Yes there's going to be rebuilding and some initial pains but Stansbury and Collins both are committed to seeing this change and that makes me hopeful for the future.

1) Can I ride on the side walks? What about if there is no bike lane? 

No, riding a bicycle on the sidewalk is against Georgia law - OCGA 40-6-144.  If a bike lane is not provided you can ride as close as practical / safe to the far right side of the lane, nearest the curb. 

2) can I ride through the cross walks? 

No, you will have to treat the bicycle like it's a car.  You can dismount and walk the bike across the cross walk. 

3) can I ride on the the side walks around campus that aren’t street adjacent 

Such as Tech Green / Skiles Walkway, or shared pathways? Yes. But it can be a bit dangerous when school's in session.

4) what’s the most common reason GTPD cites cyclists and how can I avoid it? 

We try to educate more than cite but causing an accident, running red lights, running stop signs, not yielding to pedestrians can get you a citation.

The main difference is that ""Shared Walkways"" here on campus are on private property vs the city sidewalks, which are not.  Being on private property or being designated specifically as a bicycle lane is what makes it legal.  All the sidewalks on campus and around campus are not shared walkways and bicycles are not allowed via Georgia law.

comment,"Great to see the enthusiasm! Sports are fun and a good way of connecting to your school and those around you. Generally GT is biggest on football and basketball. We've had a fair amount of success in football (4 National Championships, the latest in 1990). In fact, we're probably the last team to win a National Championship that does not have a top 30 athletic spending budget. In basketball, we were the runner up of the 2004 National Championship and have otherwise had a decent to great program over the last couple decades. I am not as educated on our other sport histories, but I know we are generally great at golf and women's tennis. Baseball has also had a fair amount of success over the years.

[This is a nice review of the basics of football.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t6hM5tRlfA) They leave out some small details, but this is about all you need to know. The only difference in college is that the rosters go up to 85 scholarship players. Paul Johnson was our head coach the last 11 seasons and mainly was known for his unique offense. He retired a couple weeks ago. We recently hired a new coach named Geoff Collins who is known for his defense and his great recruiting. It will be a fairly large change of pace and is an exciting time to get into football.

[Here is a good review of basketball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbtmGKif7Ck) The head coach is Josh Pastner and he's been great about building enthusiasm and excitement around the program. Like Collins, he came in with a reputation as a great recruiter. He's had some modest success the last two seasons and we are entering conference play pretty soon.

We play in the Atlantic Coast Conference (aka the ACC). We are among five conferences often called the Power 5. This is because these teams (65 in total) spend more on their athletic programs than most others and are seen as the most elite athletically. That being said, GT is almost always in the bottom quartile in spending, which generally labels our team as an ""underdog"" among our peers. This is in contrast to programs like UGA, Alabama, Auburn, and Clemson that are top 10 spenders.

I highly recommend you join a sports forum like [GT Swarm](https://gtswarm.com/forums/georgia-tech-football.4/) if you want to keep up to date on all of the athletics.

We'll see. Using NFL concepts, this won't happen if we continue to have recruiting classes ranked #11 in the ACC. We all know his strength is selling the brand and recruiting, but the question he will answer for us at GT is just how much a head coach like Collins can move the needle on that compared to a coach like CPJ. 

If he can really step up our recruiting, we'll compete for the coastal every year. If, in two or three years, we're still not even top 10 in the ACC in recruiting, I think things will only get worse.

comment,"Look into the Regents Engineering Pathway Program. It’s the most realistic way for any in state student to get accepted into Tech nowadays. Back when I transferred it was under a different name (RETP) and the deal was if you had a 2.7 math/science GPA with a 3.0 overall you were automatically accepted. Then in 2013 they changed it to 3.0 across the board for automatic acceptance. I transferred from Valdosta State but there are 17+ schools that participate in the program. Tech will never tell you you’re “automatically” accepted in the program and that the review process is “holistic” but in reality Georgia Tech cut a deal with the Georgia Board of Regents back in 1992 when they tried to monopolize engineering in GA so that no other school could have a program. The 17 schools that capitulated all became feeder schools and in exchange Tech made it so that requirements were more lax, hence why the program is called the “Regents” transfer program. Schools like UGA and Georgia State were banned from starting an engineering school for competition  reasons until 2014 when it just so happened there were 5 UGA alums on the Board of Regents that overruled the 20+ year law in a 5-4 ruling. Anyway, it worked for me in 2014 but the requirements have been increased again to a 3.3 for most majors. You’ll save money in the long run, increase your probability of keeping HOPE due to an easier time keeping up your grades, and ultimately once you graduate from Tech it’ll never say where you came from to get to Tech, only that you’re a graduate. My diploma came in the mail in June and from personal experience I’d say that’s the way to go. ","Positive

We don’t really have a choice in “getting someone in trouble” under these circumstances.  GA law is clear someone can’t be prosecuted if they are seeking help as it is described in the law.

To anyone reading this... if you’re underage or using drugs and you or someone else needs help... call us!!! We are here to help you.... not get you into trouble. 

I have personally been to many calls just like this and I have NEVER gotten the caller into trouble even if they are underage or using drugs.

Unrelated to checking but I was roped into getting their student credit card as well (it was my first credit card and bank account) and it has awful rewards and foreign transaction fees on top of that. 

If you don’t need to deposit cash into your account often, I’d highly recommend Charles Schwab’s checking. They’re entirely online and have very few physical locations, but they reimburse all ATM fees when using their debit card, which means you can use any ATM whenever you need cash. They also have no foreign transaction fees and reimburse overseas, so if you’re travelling or studying abroad, you can get local currency from any ATM whenever you want.

Only downside is the online thing if you require physical location services (mainly depositing cash into your account, checks can be deposited directly using mobile deposit in their app), and they don’t have the option to send you email/text updates when your account balance changes.

comment,"+1 for Schwab. Quite possibly the best checking account publicly offered imo, and you can currently get $100 for free. I've used various banks for different purposes, but Schwab is my daily driver and I haven't had any urge to switch to the other banks I've messed with. **Every** ATM is your ATM, for free. Not having access to cash deposits is a downside, but I haven't had enough of a need for it to care.

Credit unions are another good choice as far as avoiding the big national brick-and-mortar banks, but in my experience the more local/state ones tend to lag behind in UI/UX as far as their websites and apps. National ones like Ally don't have those problems, though.

**Note: Schwab requires a credit check (aka a hard pull/inquiry) to open an account. It's no big deal, but if that matters to you it's something to consider. However, they are currently offering a bonus of $100 for opening an account if you sign up using [this link](https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/promo/refer-prospect.html?refrid=REFER6EYV774D) (disclaimer: I don't get anything for you using that link, it's a public link)**",Positive,"banking, credit unions, online banks, checking accounts, atm access",6,2018-12-28

comment,"I took CS 2051 with Vazrani during Fall 2016. I would 100% recommend that class for anyone. While the CoC mostly offers courses with 150+ students, this was around 40 students where I truly got an opportunity to interact with the professor and other students in the course. We went over many interesting concepts and cemented my interest in CS (I was on the border before then). The focus was on discussion and proofs rather than following instructions and understanding examples. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, this does not mean the class itself was easy. As people have mentioned, I met some of the smartest people at the college through that class. I had to go to office hours for homework help (more than I have for any other class since) but I do feel like I truly learned a lot. All in all, if you want another large lecture-style course where you just have to show up and follow instructions, take 2050, but if you really want to grow and challenge yourself, want to learn from the brightest, and participate in discussions with the professor, I would highly suggest taking CS 2051.

comment,"Well I've taken both, I dropped 2050 after bombing the hell out of the first test, passed 2051 this semester by the skin of my teeth (both instances mainly due to major issues in my life).

The main difference that you'll need to watch out for is 2051 doesn't do nearly as much hand-holding and is not nearly as fucking pedantic as 2050. For that reason it's that much harder since you have to put in considerably more work if you've never been exposed to proofs before. 2050 can sneak up on you if you slack because it seems easy, and 2051 will fuck your shit up if you don't go to class and do the homeworks properly since there's so much material.

On that note though, if you put in the work for the class, you'll really get your tuition's worth out of it. It moves at a rapid pace and covers a large variety of topics in-depth. I'd really recommend it for everybody, unless life is kicking you in the balls for some reason to the point where you can't put in the time, in which case take 2050.

Jesus fuck dude, you trying to die? Props if you pull this off.

Anyway, one thing to realize about 1332, that's a time sink. Projects and test cases are annoying as shit. 2340 can be easy if you have a good team but you could also end up having to pick up the slack for your team, which would make it another time sink.

Beyond that, analysis is generally a hard class that you'll have to put a lot of work into (so I hear) and I personally think probability theory would he easy, but I haven't taken that specific class (though I have taken 3670, which is obviously different, so take that with a grain of salt). Dont know anything about 4032, so let's hope somebody comments about that one, but it also will probably take a lot of work.

Don't know anybody who took 2561, I'd be curious to hear how that is. 1331 is boring but easy, the professor you have is nice in my experience (she's a former coworker of mine). 2105 is also boring but easy, don't slack too hard and it's an easy A (seriously, don't slack, you'll be kicking yourself later if you do). 1102 is fine, don't worry about it. 2106 can be a very forgiving class, it's an easy A or B if you keep up with going to class and doing homeworks **properly**. I got a C and I really didn't put in much effort at all. For the love of god, READ THE FUCKING BOOK. They pull homework and exams questions from it. Learn your definitions forward and backwards, and learn your theorems and proofs thoroughly since you'll need to reproduce and extrapolate on them.

comment,"Hi there! I’m a Barcelona Summer Program alumni myself and I can honestly say it was one of the absolute greatest experiences of my life. When you get there you’re given a metro/bus pass (covered in all those fees you paid) so you can easily get to anywhere in the city. In the residence we stayed at, a lot of places like the beach and shopping/eating areas were walking distance so it was really fun to take advantage of that as well. 

Some advice that I have would be to always be aware of your surroundings and cling tightly to any bag or items that you’re carrying. I personally did not get pick pocketed but a large number of people in the study abroad program did, so really be aware! Also take advantage of exploring parts of Europe that you’d never imagined you’d go to, like aside from the basic (sorry) France or Italy. I would recommend going to countries like Greece, Hungary, Croatia, Poland, Switzerland, etc. 

Before you get to Europe, don’t forget to buy adapters for your chargers!! And while you’re in Europe, be sure to always have some cash on you as some places don’t accept certain credit cards or any credit card at all (a lot of places do though).

If you are a part of the CS Barcelona Summer Program and you’re living at Residencia Onix.... go to the local grocery store MERCADONA!!!!!! They have freshly squeezed orange juice and some of the best chocolate chip muffins I have ever had. I hope you have the one of the greatest summers of your life!!

comment,"&gt; I'd be kinda surprised if nobody asked you that question during the process

It's because they usually can't. Recruiters typically are not allowed to directly ask if someone is a citizen or not at a career fair or interview. There are ethical and legal issues that prevent recruiters from discriminating against candidates based on sex, race, nationality, citizenship, sexuality, etc... so most recruiters will never ask directly about your citizenship status and rather wait for you to self disclose on the actual application.

It is however allowed to be asked during an online application process. Those questions typically have a disclaimer that it does not affect the application process; it's mainly there so that if you lie about your citizenship then they can terminate you if you ended up getting the job. It is implied that you are a citizen if you apply for one of these positions if it is a requirement in the job requisition.",Neutral,"recruitment, citizenship",2,2018-12-29

If Georgia Southern, then stick with engineering and just use the REPP program, but if State then ultimately it won’t make a difference between the two since Georgia State is not REPP eligible. I will say mechanical engineering statistically has the most applicants and therefore has a lower probability of acceptance. Also trying to change your major after acceptance assuming you get in is usually a bad idea. Once again, if you’re using REPP, then you’ll have a major lock that will prevent you from changing majors for either a semester or two. If you have a rough first semester then you’re screwed because you need a 3.0 or higher to change into almost all engineering majors and should you have a sub 3.0 then you’ll be stuck in that major until you raise your gpa. Ultimately I’d say you need to stick with what you plan on making a career out of or otherwise you’ll just be wasting time trying to choose a major that’ll increase your probability of being accepted.

comment,"Georgia State is NOT in the REPP program. Perimeter college is. Perimeter was purchased and consolidated by Georgia State in 2015. Under state consolidation law, Perimeter functions as a satellite branch. There are no 4 year degrees in the Perimeter branch, which is why Tech agreed to keep it in REPP post 2015. Perimeter originally was granted the transfer program in 1986 and is simply retaining what has already been in place for over 30 years. This does not mean GSU magically got an olive branch and was accepted into the program as well. When you apply to Perimeter it is not even the same application as Georgia State and the requirements are not the same. Just because you see the GSU symbol and extension in the URL does not mean that all GSU students are eligible for REPP. In reality it is a minority who did not enroll into GSU’s main campus to begin with. Furthermore, it is not ALL of the USG schools who are eligible.

Also, I was a computer engineer major so the aerospace field was a completely different department. What I can say is your Math/Science gpa will be heavily scrutinized so your calculus courses as well as physics and chemistry will likely be a make or break case bc GT openly states that they take the Math/Science gpa as an entire metric on how successful you’ll be in your given major. Ultimately, the best thing you can do is keep your options open. I know that’s not easy in GA due to a lack of quality engineering schools but you definitely want to expand and make a plan B, C etc. The only other advice I can give is to try to apply for the Summer semester if possible.

comment,"Remember to download all of the files you want to keep. If you are a linux user, you might find this useful:

zsh:

    cat sites | while IFS= read -r a; 
      do
        b=(${(ps: :)a}); 
        sudo mount -t davfs https://t-square.gatech.edu/dav/""$b[1]"" temp;
        mkdir ""$b[2]"";
        cp -afv temp/* ""$b[2]"";
        sudo umount temp;
      done;

bash:

    cat sites | while IFS= read -r a; 
      do
        IFS="" "" read -r -a b &lt;&lt;&lt; ""$a"";
        sudo mount -t davfs https://t-square.gatech.edu/dav/""${b[0]}"" temp;
        mkdir ""${b[1]}"";
        cp -afv temp/* ""${b[1]}"";
        sudo umount temp;
      done;

(If you're in the davfs group, and your davfs is configured with setuid then you don't need the sudo)

Where sites is a file formatted like this:

    gtc-7cf3-5d86-5a7e-a342-fee6e161bc31 CHEM-1310-SPR16
    gtc-44e2-e28b-51cf-b2fa-4012c8fc4d87 CHEM-1310-C-SPR16

Which you can generate the source of the ""Worksite Setup"" page reasonably easily.

To reduce the amount of credential input, you'll probably want to put the following in your `/etc/davfs2/secrets` file:

    /full/path/to/t-square-backup/temp &lt;your gt username&gt; &lt;your password&gt;

comment,"Realize that your situation is not unique.  Based on my observations, about 5% of seniors are dealing with some sort of mental illness ranging from depression to anxiety.  You are not alone.  This also means that there are people at GT who know what to do for you.

Go discuss your situation with the Dean of Students the first chance you get.  Send an email.  Set up and appointment.  Bring documentation if you have it.  Explain where you are and ask for help.

The sooner you reach out, the more flexibility the administration has in dealing with your situation.  If you bailed on the last couple weeks or so of classes due to a medical issue such as depression, the incomplete is there to address that exact situation.

Go talk to them.

Edit to add: You are kind of lucky with your timing.  (If there may be slight silver lining to this cloud.)  Right now the administration is highly motivated to help students dealing with mental illness.  They recognize that they have not been doing enough to help students and are trying to change that.",Neutral,"mental illness, support, administration, timing.",1,2018-12-31
