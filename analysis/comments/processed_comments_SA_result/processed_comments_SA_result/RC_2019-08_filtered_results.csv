Also because I was still figuring it out, I didn't realize there were online quizzes, too which dropped me a letter grade since I didn't do any. Even the easiest class is going to add work and stress. The key is to keep the total stress down.

To really beat the point to death: classes all have a set, positive quantity of work/stress involved. ""Easy"" classes have less than hard classes, but they do not subtract work/stress. If you took 20+ hours of all easy classes, you'll be just as stressed as taking 12 hours of hard classes. And if you don't take that easy class seriously, then you have to explain how you made a B or C in what should've been an easy A.

Incident Date/Time: December 30, 2014, at approximately 6:15 p.m.

Incident Location: Hemphill Avenue, NW near Center Street Apartments

Incident Description: A student reported to the Atlanta Police Department that while walking north on Hemphill Avenue, just north of the Georgia Tech Police Department, he was approached by a black male who brandished a handgun and demanded the student's phone.  When the student refused to give the suspect his phone, the suspect fired the weapon in the direction of the student.  The student began to approach the male, who retreated to a black 4-door sedan that was parked a short distance away.  As the student continued to approach the male, he fired a second shot in the direction of the student before climbing into the passenger seat.  The vehicle was last seen heading northbound on Hemphill Avenue.  The student believed the gun might have been loaded with blanks.  

After the incident, the student continued walking north on Hemphill Avenue before deciding to contact the police approximately ten  to fifteen minutes later.  The student met with Atlanta Police and Georgia Tech Police at the McDonald's on Northside Drive, where officers began to canvas the surrounding area.  Investigators are currently processing the crime scene.",negative,-0.9584,neutral,-0.03222222222222222,08/01/2019
comments,"I've had a good experience with the Chinese classes at Tech, though I did have some knowledge going in so that probably made things easier. I do know a lot of students that started with no previous experience though, and they learned pretty quickly. I personally vouch for the Mandarin-teaching staff, haven't had a bad professor yet. There's also lots of study abroad programs which are extremely fun and educational, I highly recommend doing one if you are interested in learning a language. I went on the Chinese LBAT program and it improved my Mandarin considerably, finally was able to hold conversations with my relatives in China!

There's also a program where you can walk in and practice talking with native speakers outside of class, very casual and a good way to learn in a more relaxed setting. There's lots of students around campus that are fluent in Korean or Chinese (I hear people speaking it almost every single day) and you'll almost certainly run into some of them, so if you make friends you could practice with them too :)",positive,0.9889,positive,0.1481519274376417,08/01/2019

I think the point of these programs in high school and college is to give women / URM chances to build their resume and skills when traditional opportunities to do that might more often be given to males. For example, I know of a high school girl who tried to learn CS in her high school robotics team but no one would really include her in the CS activities since she was the only female. In the long run, this might set her behind her male peers when looking for internships. Programs like this are looking to sort of counter weight the negative experiences some women may have faced.

Ehhhhh. Don't really think so.

-[As reported in PNAS in 2014](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/03/05/1314788111.abstract), women are significantly less likely to get an interview than men for STEM positions. This isn't the only study showing this either.

-[Here's a 2015 article showing the majority of women in STEM education programs (HS-Doctoral) report gender bias](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0361684315596162?journalCode=pwqa). 

-It extends into research too - women are less likely to have research grants funded - https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)32611-4/fulltext, a new piece from earlier this year.

I'd argue that being discriminated against throughout your education, being less likely to be hired, and less likely to have a grant funded is exactly the definition of institutional disadvantages. They're also less likely to be promoted quickly once hired on, even with equal performance.

&gt;The only thing left are individual's mindsets/ attitudes twords women in STEM

Thing is, those people are part of the institution. They're colleagues, they're hiring managers, they're the people in charge of promotions. Simply because laws exist requiring gender equality does not mean institutions are fully equal when the people left are in positions of power. Individual's mindsets and attitudes won't change for no reason. Waiting for that to occur is a great way to just let bias continue.

&gt;Ok, woman are less likely to get interviews: Nothing here shows it has anything to do with bias, or disadvantages. Do we really want to jump to the conclusion that recruiters are that biased against women, and there are no other significant a factors in play?

If only the researchers from Columbia and the reviewers at PNAS had ever thought of that.......oh wait! Let's just copy the intro because you clearly didn't read it.

&gt;Does discrimination contribute to the low percentage of women in mathematics and science careers? **We designed an experiment to isolate discrimination’s potential effect.** Without provision of information about candidates other than their appearance, men are twice more likely to be hired for a mathematical task than women. If ability is self-reported, women still are discriminated against, because employers do not fully account for men’s tendency to boast about performance. Providing full information about candidates’ past performance reduces discrimination but does not eliminate it. **We show that implicit stereotypes (as measured by the Implicit Association Test) predict not only the initial bias in beliefs but also the suboptimal updating of gender-related expectations when performance-related information comes from the subjects themselves.**

At least read the damn abstract that covers everything you railed against within the first two lines.

&gt;Women report bias: This is also meaningless. Every group will report they have experienced bias; it's how the human psyche works. Self-reported discrimination doesn't prove anything.

I'm sure the women who experience bias would 100% agree there are no negative consequences to it. Oh wait!

&gt;As expected, participants who encountered gender bias had lower STEM self-concept than participants who did not. 

And men don't report near the same amount of gender bias as women in STEM, so the ""every group"" doesn't really hold.

&gt;Less funding: Also not meaningful data, correlation does not equal causation, and unless this study and the first were maticulously normalized for every other potential factor, it's not meaningful to connect the two for purposes of finding a reason.

Once again, read the dang paper

&gt;Because most studies have been observational, it is unclear whether imbalances stem from evaluations of female research investigators or of their proposed research. In 2014, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research created a natural experiment by dividing investigator-initiated funding applications into two new grant programmes: one with and one without an explicit review focus on the calibre of the principal investigator.

Again, they managed to isolate gender as best as possible. Of course there's always some factors you can't normalize for, that's true in every single experiment. It doesn't magically invalidate the conclusions that are statistically significant. And the Lancet has very high standards for conclusions, they're a very high tier journal. I trust their standards and reviewers.

Uhhh....on what basis? That's not how statistics works. Plus, if anything, they should probably hire the woman, as studies show more diverse teams achieve better results.

Also, the study didn't just do the photos section, they moved on to providing full information of the candidate's past and found a reduced but still present result. That was mentioned in the abstract too, you would've noticed if you read it. They had a large portion of lower-qualified men hired over higher-qualified women, something like 30% of hired candidates were less-qualified men.

The fountain itself is largely a matter of being too expensive. The actual architect of the campanile never wanted a fountain to begin with (partly because they didnt like the idea of large amounts of water being immediately over a concrete foundation). That, along with the installtion and operational cost of a fountain, means that it's not in the current plans. The project is on a tight budget, so costs are going to more essential parts of the project.

Having said that, if you do feel strongly (I also love chilling out by the fountain, much to the dismay of my growing farmer's tan), you can reach out to the Student Center Expansion Committee (contact info on the site in OP's post) to provide feedback and learn more, as well as Student Center staff at future Student Center info. sessions, focus groups, and so on (I believe there should be plenty of opportunities this fall).

Coincidentally, the OP sounds just like you. As a male, with strong believes like his, anyone would have given up the scholarship opportunity to the next female candidate. Yet that never happened. Such a hypocrite, or two.

I'm not sure I consider the explicit bias towards women you mention as evidence of an equal environment. These examples are showing that we are considering targeted benefits for women part of an equal environment. Then what happens when the people complaining get their way?

If these CEOs are prioritizing women, and this fellowship is only accepting gender minorities and women, what happens if they disappear? Your examples show that these things are part of an equal environment, but the argument being tossed around here is removing all of these benefits.

I spend a ton of time helping young people of all genders—including men—get started in the industry. Hell, I’d even be willing to offer you some mentorship and advice if you want it. 

You seem to think that because this one program helps tackle a specific challenge — the long lasting and systemic discrimination against people based on gender — that no one affiliated with it could fathom that other challenges exist, too.

&gt; On the road to success, how many female ""casualties"" did people like you step over?

Good question! I don’t know the answer, though I’ve certainly given it some thought over the years. I am pretty confident the answer is zero over the last decade or so, but I’m sure the answer is *not* zero over my lifetime. I’m not aware of any specific instances, and I’d like to think I would have objected if I ever had been aware of them, but I’m sure they happened when I was too young or too self absorbed to notice. That makes it tough to make it up to anyone, but I can sure as hell can pay it forward. 

&gt; did you correct the wrongs you did to THOSE people that are still working under people like you? By mentoring young female students? 

Yes—in addition to mentoring male students (why, I even offered to mentor you, because I am a hopeless optimist!), non binary students, and young professionals of every sort. And I guess some older professionals, too, now that I think about it. 

&gt; They are not even the same people! 

True! Should that stop me from helping them? You seem to think helping people who haven’t been wronged by me would be bad, except in the specific case that you think I should go out of my way to help men more than I already do.  Strange! I wonder why that could be?

&gt; And why are you guys still the ones making all the important decisions? Aren't you responsible for what happened in your industry?

I find it odd that you think I should be responsible for things that happened before I entered the industry, but that women and other underrepresented groups have no right to benefit from programs that seek to remedy those old — and, tragically, still ongoing — ills. It’s not self evident how that has any logical consistency. Strange!

But I absolutely am responsible for the things I’ve done since I attained my first leadership positions, starting back when I was your age and growing more frequent and more senior with time. I think I’ve got a fairly good track record of unbiased hiring and generous mentorship. But I’m a human, not a saint, and have certain screwed things up along the way, especially when I was a new and inexperienced leader. I’ve tried to always learn from mistakes, to always listen to feedback and advice from people of any age — especially if they come from a background that’s much different than mind, which generally gives them a perspective that’s very interesting and valuable for me to hear. 

It sounds from your messages like you are frustrated by having a hard time breaking into the aerospace industry. I’m sorry to hear that! Don’t give up, and don’t seek solace in anger. The good news is that the Georgia Tech network is excellent, and the caliber of education you are receiving is top notch.

The student center (although technically it's changing to the campus center because it evidently doesn't care about the students) did an absolutely *terrible* job being open about this.

What I really want to know is: is it even possible to still change things?

&gt; You know, this is exactly the same answer I'd expect from people like you: ZERO! No female was ever more qualified for the job/promotion you got!

You may wish to go back and actually reread my answer. I’d specifically call your attention to the part where I said “I’m sure the answer is not zero over my lifetime.” Notably, that is literally the exact opposite of what you claim I said. Strange!

&gt; No favoritism helped you!

I’m a straight white American dude who went to Harvard. Favoritism has helped me my whole life. Recognizing that fact is one that motivated me to work as hard as I have on this Fellowship. What are you talking about?

&gt; And your hiring ratio was 50/50 over the ""multiple decades""!!

Yep! Are pretty close to it. Currently, my direct reports are 50/50; I don’t have my exact lifetime statistics in front of me, but it’s certainly pretty close. I don’t say this to brag; in fact, the whole premise of the Fellowship is that that shouldn’t be particularly praiseworthy. Goodness knows it wasn’t all that difficult to do—it just requires actually paying attention. 

&gt; Sounds like you are very different from most execs in your industry, yet you've somehow entered the inner circle of the good old boys club.

To the extent I’m in the old boys club, I largely got in in a similar way to others, I’m sure. Thing within my control, though, is what I do once in there, and who else I go out of my way to help into that inner circle. I’ve helped lots of people in over the years; through this specific program, I’m helping women and non-binary students in, having observed that their are extraordinarily underrepresented and tragically excluded. 

&gt; I know you've created your powerful scholarship program at 18

No I didn’t! As has been pointed out above. 

&gt; My goal is doing it at age 36, and not with my own money

Awesome! That almost exactly the age I actually was when I helped start this program! I wish you good luck. 

&gt; My goal is doing it at age 36, and not with my own money, but corporate money, as part of my job

Very cool. That’s a good way to do it, if you’ve found a cause others care about and you’ve developed a good model and method. Again, good luck!

&gt; then I plan on bragging about it in front of a bunch of 18, 19, 20 year olds. 

Weird flex, but okay...

(I feel like maybe this all is some kind of weird mockery that didn’t land? Hard to say,)

&gt; After all, I did not get in the community college I wanted, so I ended up here.

That sounds like a very interesting story. I’ve never really heard of someone not getting into a community college of choice and then going on to a school as highly ranked as Georgia Tech as a backup plan. I bet that was pretty surreal! And I would’ve thought that path would make one a bit more optimistic about life.

EDIT: Whoops, you ninja-edited your post. Let’s add in the new bit.

Its kinda like how the other season ticket holders in the stadium always have their same seats. And honestly we get a much better price on tickets than a lot of comparable schools.

While the WiFi coverage is good enough for most use cases, we do recommend using an Ethernet cable where possible for the best performance and reliability.

comments,"I think that's definitely valid, and I feel where you're coming from. To the UTC point, student opinion has impacted the space MN is getting in the student center, and spaces have been designed to fit their practice and performance needs (with direct input from MN and other student groups), and a lounge space has been added in their area as well. Nevertheless, it's not the same as Under the Couch, and the new student center won't replicate that space, with its uniqueness, exactly as it was, with these combinations of spaces. I would say that there has been a good effort to make the spaces available cater to that environment as much as possible (and there is a lot of context why an exact replica of UTC isn't within the scope of this project). But, again, it's not perfect.

As a student committee, it's our job to advocate for students in the best way possible, and that often takes the form of thoroughly explaining why something is important to students and translating that into parts for the project. But this does lead to compromise, which sometimes is dissatisfying. 

To that end, there is still room to advocate for changes in this project, and there will be room to advocate after its completion. So feel free to reach out, and we can talk more",positive,0.8598,positive,0.19533492822966506,08/02/2019

It seems like maybe you haven't had time to actually read my posts, since I've said the direct opposite of this multiple times now.

&gt; Here is the thing, say you recruit a female to replace you. Suddenly you've helped to increase number of female execs in the industry, and an experienced female worker gets the job she deserves. You'll be setting a good example for other male execs to follow - quit and be replaced by experienced female execs. When upper management has a balanced ratio, the rest will fall into place. Win win. Why isn't this even considered?

In addition to considering this, I've actually done this before.  There you go with those bad assumptions again!

&gt;Instead, people like you are holding on tight to your big fat salary, bonus, stock options and the privileges you've had all your life according to your own description, and you come after young male in the stem field.

If by 'come after' you mean 'repeatedly offer to mentor,' I guess you wouldn't be all that far off with this statement? (Also, having spent much of my career to date working at / starting non-profits, I love those assumptions about my salary etc.)

&gt; Young workers pose no immediate threat to people like you, whereas experienced female workers, with promotion opportunities like yours, will replace you.

I actively hope workers from both those categories will replace me eventually--maybe even quite soon. Like most managers, I try to hire my potential replacement every time I have a job opening. I don't plan on working forever! And I don't feel threatened by talented people -- I feel motivated and inspired by them. Goodness knows that we need more talent in this industry.

&gt; Pay the debt you guys owe! 

Great idea! Maybe I could like start a Fellowship program or two! LOL.

&gt; Right now you are not ""paying it forward"", you as a bunch of decision makers are standing on the moral high ground and telling poor young male students to pay your debt for you.

Again, this does not seem to reflect the facts in any way.

&gt; You yourselves continue to enjoy what you have and will not lose any of it!

I do enjoy what I have -- a big part of which are these programs designed specifically to help young people get their start in the aerospace industry. That's one of the most enjoyable and fulfilling things I get to do with my time, and I'll always happily encourage others of every age to do as much of it as they can.


You continue to seem really angry at the world. I hope you are able to address that point and find something positive that motivates you.

comments,"While a petition might help get some better answers, what this will probably come down to as with so many other school decisions is **money**. It costs money to build a new fountain with all of the plumbing and equipment it requires, and it costs money to keep it operational and clean. Just think about how often the fountain has been turned off for maintenance or cleaning. Some years it seemed to spend more time off than on.

There may also be practical tradeoffs, such as not wanting to lose a large footprint of land for a fountain that could instead be used for walkways, events, and open space for people to mingle. Plus, fountains are not very environmentally friendly, consuming electricity and evaporating away large amounts of clean water; that might make it a tough or impossible sell for a school that's been doing LEED gold standard construction.

It might be possible to come up with a compromise plan. I would be very interested to see a water feature that's designed to be sat in... maybe a wide flat shallow area with seats intended for you to sit on and do homework while you dip your feet in the water. But unless people are willing to step forward with large donations, I don't have high hopes for the school changing their plan.",positive,0.4516,positive,0.08912438672438676,08/02/2019

Kierzkowski is pretty good. I had her last year and it was a good experience. She really knows her stuff and knows how to explain it well.

I’m glad that you realize that adjusting to Tech takes time and are taking a lighter to offset that.

While I have no personal experience with A levels,  I did take Math 1551 my first semester and it wasn’t too rough. Math 1554 is a decent bit of work it you haven’t been exposed to linear algebra in the past . CS 1301 is not a big time commitment and in general is an easy class.

Check out ratemyprof and course critique for ENG 1101 professors as they can make the class really fun or nightmare( 1102 was fun, 1101 wasn’t )

HIST 2112 is a pretty chill class, I took it with Flamming ( MWF 9:05) and he’s  supposed to be one of the easier professors ( it’s an easy A if you show up to classes and pay attention). I have also heard good things about INTA 1200 but don’t have personal experience.

The 1956 Sugar Bowl featured the 7th ranked Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the 11th ranked Pitt Panthers. The game was played on January 2, since New Year's Day was a Sunday. Much controversy preceded the 1956 Sugar Bowl. There was controversy over whether Bobby Grier from Pitt should be allowed to play because he was black, and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Georgia governor Marvin Griffin's opposition to integration.

comments,"Welcome! I'd recommend that you limit your class schedule to 12 hours your first semester - I recommend that for everyone. It's a big adjustment (which you're at least aware of!) so giving yourself the flexibility to integrate into college life is important. 

As far as classes / professors, you can use: https://critique.gatech.edu/

You type in the course number and select your prof and you can see the aggregate data from previous semesters. 

There's also https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=361

You can take those two math courses together, yes. Some are excluded and you'll see that listed online when you register. 

I didn't do British stuff, just the american AP system. Take every single credit you are eligible for - there is no point in retaking a course you have a credit in just because college math is 'different'. I'm not sure where that concept got started, I heard it myself when I started in 2011. There's no point toiling away. If you have the credit, take it! Do not retake math courses. 

GT1000 is not mandatory. However it's a possible good way to meet other freshmen specifically and if it's still the same, you get help making a resume and interviewing older students in your major.",positive,0.9706,positive,0.10610902255639099,08/03/2019

I say only different thing in Calc 1, I think, is unlike A-Level Math where u are directly doing differentiation [dx^n /dx = nx^(n-1)], the college class tries to explain why we do it or how we got  the formula, and so on. There might be few new concepts but it is very easy to learn.

comments,"First I want to thank you for sharing your thoughts with us and I want to say a few things before giving you some thoughts of my own on some of your points. The first is that a lot of people feel the way you do; I definitely did a couple of years ago, and although others may seem like they have everything figured out their mental monologues are probably very similar to yours. The second is recommending therapy. Therapists aren't as scary as they may seem and they are excellent at helping with the problems that you're having. They helped me for example.

Now for your points.

(1) I strongly feel your point here. A couple of years ago I felt like I had no major hobbies either, but I've gained interests in speedrunning, weight-lifting, running, meditation, hiking, and anime, and I'd like to share a couple of tips that I think may help:  
* Don't define your interest in a hobby by your skill in it, but rather by how much you enjoy it and what you get out of it. I am a bad runner, but after every run I feel better and it makes me feel better throughout the day so it doesn't matter.  
* Don't be afraid to give up a new hobby if it isn't working. If you don't feel a lot of joy in a new hobby, doing it will start to feel like a chore which will stop you from trying new ones.  
* Nobody's opinion on your hobby matters but your own.  
* To reiterate again, the only true point of a hobby is to make you happy.

(2) I think this is a common feeling, but few people in reality will ever get upset when you try to help them, especially if you explain your own anxieties and feelings. Others respect altruism, and the fact that you have such altruistic feelings reflects well upon yourself. Perhaps you can start by doing constructed helping, such as volunteering somewhere like a soup kitchen or an animal shelter. You'll also never get better at helping others unless you try. :)

(3) I want to give you two ways to look at impostor syndrome. The first is that Tech very rarely makes mistakes, you can just tell by the statistics that Tech grads are overwhelmingly good at what they do, and Tech has chosen you to represent them. The second is that even if Tech did ""make a mistake"" when they accepted you (which they didn't), who cares? You have been given a great opportunity and they can't revoke your acceptance now! Might as well make the best of it!

You're a thoughtful guy or gal and that's a good thing. I hope I helped in some small way and I'm here if you want to talk more.",positive,0.9985,positive,0.24434486914600548,08/03/2019
comments,"Great comment above. 

1) You’ll find things you enjoy. Keep trying new things and doing stuff. It’s also possible that you won’t have one or two key hobbies you may drift from hobby to hobby or interest to interest and that’s cool too. 

2) You can’t go wrong I’m genuinely helping people. Give it your best shot and however you’ve helped will be appreciative. 

3) As stated above. You’re not a mistake at Tech. You’re not alone in feeling like you may not belong at Tech but you do. Everyone at Tech belongs there.",positive,0.9217,positive,0.26553030303030306,08/03/2019

I struggled with imposter syndrome for the longest time at tech; I was always really hard on myself and ended up becoming my worst enemy.

Something that really helped me overcome it was that I started asking myself: “did I truly try my best and give 100% of what I am capable of?” If the answer to that was yes, then that’s the most that I can ask of myself and whatever the result would be I know that I gave it my all.

Dining dollars are just tax-free dollars for food. For example, if you went to Chick-fil-a and bought a chicken sandwich combo, you would pay for it and not have any taxes. But if you used Buzzfunds, regular cash, or card, taxes would be applied.

I wouldn't recommend getting a meal plan per se but rather just buy a handful of dining dollars and refill them as needed.

THAT BEING SAID, YOU SHOULD NOT PATRONIZE THESE ESTABLISHMENTS.

comments,"Look, I used to burn hot for GPA, SAT, all that jazz in high school - I liked having numbers that told me that I was good at things and I cared about it.

I went to Tech, I fucked around, and I realized that for all the time, energy, and effort I invested in caring about my GPA, doing so was neither healthy nor valuable. I tied my own self-worth to those numbers on paper, and I sacrificed so much of my social life in high school and early college just to keep those little numbers high - and for what? 

Sure, employers care about your GPA, but they don't care about GPA for GPA's sake - the *reason* that they care is that it demonstrates how much you care and can invest yourself in work. Maybe there are some close-minded employers who think that you're worthless if you don't meet the threshold, but most folks understand that there are many ways to demonstrate your value as an employee or student, and GPA is *one* of them, but not the *only* one. 

I have an average GPA but I got an internship this summer because I spent time doing projects I love to work on instead of burning for a perfect GPA. They didn't care about the GPA, they cared that I loved what I did enough to do in my spare time and they wanted me to do it for them.

So take it from someone who has been in your shoes - you're more than your transcript. Don't sell yourself short on a couple numbers.",positive,0.993,positive,0.22407051282051282,08/04/2019

That’s exactly what happened in El Paso. Some random guy from a Dallas suburb had a problem with a diverse community living happy safe lives and decided murder was the way to go. No warning, no nothing. And GTPD can’t do anything about this.

The important thing to remember is that domestic terrorists accomplish their goals when they instill fear into their victims, dead or alive. We can’t live our lives in fear. If you want to take necessary precautions, then do the active shooter training and take comfort in knowing that you’ve done what you can to be prepared if a real shooter ever gets on campus.

More generally, the best action you can take as a private citizen to prevent mass shootings is vote. Your voice matters. Hold lawmakers accountable. No matter what your political opinion is, mentally ill extremists should not have easy access to weapons and ammunition, and Georgia’s state govt. doesn’t do enough to prevent potential tragedies.

Annually, our officers receive between 24-40 hours of specialized training in active shooter/threat response. Our 90+ officers are fully equipped to rapidly respond to any situation that occurs on our campus. Quarterly, we conduct active threat training exercises in conjunction with students, faculty and staff to enhance our preparedness levels and response capabilities. Just last week, we conducted a large-scale active shooter exercise at the Campus Recreation Center. We also conduct joint training with the Atlanta Police Department, Atlanta Fire Rescue and other area law enforcement agencies.

The Georgia Tech Police Department conducts dozens of Civilian Response to Active Shooter (CRASE) trainings on campus throughout the year. These classes are designed to prepare are community members to respond properly in the event of an active threat on campus.

The Institute and the Police Department invest heavily in mitigation strategies to prevent such incidents before they occur. We are involved in numerous partnerships with campus, local, state and federal law enforcement entities to identify persons of concern and address any threats before they are acted on. The GTPD has also strategically placed gunshot detection systems across campus to provide real time alerting in the event of a gunfire incident. This system is integrated into our network of 2500+ cameras and can provide real-time situational awareness. Lastly, our Georgia Tech Emergency Notification System (GTENS) would be used to communicate safety critical information should such an incident like this occur.

It is our hope that nothing like this ever happens on our campus, but GTPD is confident we are fully prepared to respond to any threats to our community. We encourage everyone to attend CRASE training and to download and use our campus safety app, LiveSafe. The LiveSafe app provides additional guidance on what to do in emergency situations, such as an active shooter event. If anyone is interested in attending a CRASE class, please contact us at crimeprevention@police.gatech.edu.",positive,0.9863,neutral,-0.0394927536231884,08/04/2019

When you're faced with no ability to run or hide (shooter entered a room, covering only entrance, you're in a long hallway where running makes you a prime target, etc.), fighting is the best option. The goal of CCW is to protect yourself and intimate relations (family), not to be a superhero. That said, someone has to stop the shooter, whether it's a cop or a regular Joe.

2. Cops see a dude with a gun after responding to an active shooter call, they are very likely to fire on you. Some will bark an order first, giving you opportunity, some won't (happened at a church shooting last year, the hero was shot). It's part of the risk of the game, and is true for plainclothes cops as well.

3. It's absurd that we have these conversations where other countries don't because other countries trample on the rights of their people.

I wrote this out in another comment. Run/hide/fight. Fighting is the third option, though sometimes it's the first you should consider. You'd learn in great detail about these topics in an into CCW course.


&gt; A pistol isn't useful within a few feet.

A pistol is absolutely useful in trained hands at ranges from direct contact out to 50ish yards or more. Numerous police and non-police gunfights, documented by departments or on Youtube, bear this out very well.

&gt;A decent kick to the balls is.

Again, spoken like someone with little experience fighting or managing actual risks. 
How often do you train your kicks? What's your effective range? How do you close range with an armed gunman to make this kick? What if he's too close for you to get enough leg in to reach his groin? What if it's a woman? What if you've been shot and your  hip flexors are screwed, or your rectus abdominus is perforated and the pain prevents you from properly tightening your core to engage the kick? What if the assailant is much beefier than you are, and is trained in hand-hand fighting? 
An actual weapon and training would make for a much more level fight, and improve your odds of survival dramatically in that case.",positive,0.5336,positive,0.1430847338935574,08/05/2019

comments,"&gt;More guns has always caused more violence. In no world have guns been a safer option. 

Patently false. If a bear attacks you, are you safer armed and trained, or unarmed? That would be a ""world"" in which you are safer. The statement also doesn't even reach the point of the conversation. Bad guys will kill you. You can defend yourself, or not defend yourself. You're likely safer to defend yourself. Having a weapon and training makes it even safer for you.

&gt;A good guy with a gun may stop a bad guy with a gun, but only after 10 people are already dead. How about let no one have a gun?

Because guns aren't the only weapon, you won't effectively remove them from all criminals, confiscation violates the basic human rights to property and self defense, and such action is literally punishing the innocent for the crimes of the guilty.

&gt;If you can't figure that out, then you're not worth a conversation, cretin.

Here's where you make my point, and where my quote is verified. You fire off a bunch of ignorance and false statements, and them tell me I'm a worthless cretin for not agreeing with your normative assessments. I suppose I should have just given this comment first instead of a hostile quip, but I had also hoped that you were trolling and messing around, honestly.

&gt;...Did you just invent a complete misquote based on your own insecure feelings of my legitimate criticism or your deranged attachment to mass killing machines?

I explained why the quote is a praphrasing above. I have no ""deranged attachment"" to killing machines. I analyzed a situation, and determined that a tool and training in its use will improve my livlihood. None of your criticism has been legitimate, as I've pointed out. They may be legitimate feelings, or understandable conclusions coming from a perspective of ignorance, but they are not valid criticisms.

&gt;Moron, if you can explain to me how you, with your pistol with no training

Every comment I've mentioned includes training. Strawman me if you want, but it only invalidates your arguments and wastes both of our times.

&gt;can stop a guy with a semi automatic rifle in a crowd before he kills a few dozen people, 

It's happened several times, and several more if you include police armed with pistols. Do you think posessing a rifle makes one impervious to penetration by projectiles at 900+ fps?

&gt;crowd before he kills a few dozen people, let all police forces in the US know ASAP.

That's not the point of the message. The purpose for carrying is to improve your odds. You're the one claiming that CC doesn't improve the odds, to the contrary of reality. You may fail and get shot anyway, but you will have a better chance of stopping the shooter than if you cry on the floor, or attempt to kick him in the balls.

That said, the Dayton shooter was stopped by LEO's within 30 seconds. Why were they so quick? They were on-site. If they hadn't been on-site, and taken 5, 10, 15 minutes to arrive, the death toll would have been worse. The same applies to folks who carry. Being on-ite improves outcomes. 

&gt; If cops in Las Vegas can't stop a man in a hotel room from killing over 100 people, your dumbass and your ""protection"" are not going to do shit.

Non-sequitur fallacy. The police were not on-site, and actually waited for a significant amount of time before entering the room, for their own safety. If you're in a room with a shooter you won't be waiting (neither would cops if they were being shot at).

&gt;If anyone needs counseling, it's definitely you. 

And why would that be? Having a nuanced and well-informed opinion on a topic instead of spewing ignorant tropes?

&gt;My hatred is towards guns

Inanimate objects with no will of their own.

&gt;anyone idiotic enough to defend having MORE of them, 

Failure to understand the context by which that conclusion is arrived at. If a bad guy is trying to kill me, I will use, and am justified using, whatever tools I can acquire to defend myself. Your suggestion that I should just die is both callous and hateful.

&gt;much less think that society should remove them.

Could you clarify? I don't get this portion. I don't think ""society"" (men armed with guns) should remove guns from other people armed with guns, when those people aren't hurting others.

&gt;Stop playing the victim of being oppressed because people don't want you having your instant murder machines.

If you violate my rights, I am indeed a victim. That's one of the base definitions of the word. ""Instant murder machines"", like a hammer, car, fist, rock, knife, stick? All can kill in an instant. Your appeal to emotion, to the exclusion of logic, is disheartening.

&gt;Obviously, it's a cultural problem. Americans are more dangerous than any other Western nation. My country has about a quarter as many guns per capita as the US, but almost no gun deaths per year. However, that is because people here with guns have to face some of the strictest regulation in the world, whereas in the USA there are numerous cases of people walking into gun shows without permits, and buying guns.

Not the best site sadly, but I found it in less than 3 seconds. If you can't even do this, why do you put so much effort into these silly comparisons?

I want people to be able to protect themselves against assailants. You want people to not have this ability (ironically you want this restriction to be enforced by other men with guns). If any system makes victims out of people, it is the system which prevents them from defending themselves.

comments,"nalliable, since you seem unwilling or unable to cite any applicable data to support your rampage, I'll be happy to supply some. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There are about 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, this number is not disputed. (1)

U.S. population 328 million as of January 2018. (2)

Do the math: 0.00915% of the population dies from gun related actions each year.

Statistically speaking, this is insignificant. It's not even a rounding error.

What is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths:

• 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3)

• 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4)

• 489 (2%) are accidental (5)

So no, ""gun violence"" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population.

Still too many? Let's look at location:

298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6)

327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6)

328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6)

764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6)

That's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities.

This leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others

Yes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute...

But what about other deaths each year?

70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7)

49,000 people die per year from the flu (8)

37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9)

Now it gets interesting:

250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10) You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!

610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11) Even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.).

A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides.

Simple, easily preventable, 10% reductions!

We don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem.

Despite having some of the most reputed professors in Computer Engineering in my field, students prefer to go to competitor schools like UMich or UT - because of the generous stipend, subsidized housing for GRAs and GTAs and NO mandatory fees.

comments,"No, I'm not. I'm talking about the special USG institutional fee that OP specifically calls out in her post. Outside of that fee specifically, the cost of all other mandatory fees has really only increased minimally in the last 15 years. 

It's a little difficult to find official sources on data going back that far, but I did find [this old thread from a former student who tracked their costs by semester](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/32weev/since_were_talking_about_tuition_and_fees_a_graph/). The USG fee, originally $200 per semester, increased to $544 in 2011. When this particular student graduated in 2013, they were paying $1196 in fees per semester. As the graduate fee total is now $1012 for Fall19, it follows that that graduate fees have actually *decreased* within the last 6 years (and tuition schedules going back to 2014 on the Bursar's website substantiate this). This decrease is predicated on that fact that graduate students are now exempt from a portion of the special fee ($344 instead of $544); undergraduate students aren't so lucky.

Now, is it reasonable to charge over $1000 in mandatory fees to graduate students for campus services that most of them will likely rarely use? No, not at all. Is the special USG institutional fee a baldfaced money grab that was implemented on dubious justifications and allowed a continued existence through sheer criminal momentum? Yes, absolutely.

What is white culture?

I dont yet know what white culture is, so I'll assume you mean white people. Why do you think white people are unsupportive of other races and ethnicities? Every white person is different and their skin color doesnt affect their support for people of other backgrounds. There could be white people who dont care at all about your race and there could be white people who hate you for being white. The point is, I dont think your race affects your likelihood of being a racist.    
     
&gt;these affinity groups are needed to support the transition to college from family at home among other things.   
      
why can only people of your own ethnicity support your transition to college? In my opinion, it's quite racist and stupid to only associate with people of your own ethnicity. There are so many people of all different backgrounds at this school, and I think youre doing a serious disservice to yourself if you choose to only interact with members of your own race.

comments,"Georgia Tech is a public sector employer, and as such GT employees are exempted from federal labor protections (NLRA and LMRA). Some states, such as Illinois, independently passed legislation that mirrors the NLRA so that public sector workers could have similar rights. Georgia is not one of those states. Now, Georgia cannot affirmatively prevent you from joining a union, the first amendment's freedom of association gives you that right, but, public sector employers are under no obligation to collectively bargain with your union unless they voluntarily choose to do so.

This is not to say that joining a union under these conditions is futile, or that nothing can be won through collective action. The West Virginia and Arizona teacher's strikes happened in states where, like in Georgia, there was no obligation for employers to collectively bargain. Both strikes won major concessions from the government. Before the passage of the NLRA employers were under no obligation to collectively bargain and union still formed, struck, and won. After all, if the workers take a notion . . .

comments,"The only real way to stop this is by going to GSGA, unionizing graduate students, and/or getting the professors on your side. There are some sympathetic professors, but there are also a number of profs in the older thought camp. This camp believes that Graduate students dont need to be paid much because they are reaping the benefits of a cheap education. Furthermore, if you paid students more, then they would not leave graduate school.  Basically, graduate students are a bunch of lazy, self-entitled brats that do not really know what they want to accomplish in life.  Therefore, the motivation to work hard and get out for a better position should be high.  Except that most departments have not adjusted their CoL for students which leads to highly strained budgets.  It is a load of crap imho, but that is the mindset (after 7yrs in grad school at Tech, I've had those conversations).  
Second, GSGA was the originator of the cheap healthcare option for graduate students. Before my time (around 2009-2010) was when graduate students pushed for better healthcare. They did a remarkable job but since then, it seems GSGA has lost its will to go toe to toe or to organize the graduate student body.  Which leads to unionization. Then you have a collective body of 8-12k students willing to walk out of labs, and stand at the President's door to protest change. I think Peterson was a lot more amenable to the plight of the graduate student, but his administration was fraught with Fraud.  Now with Garcia, I'm not sure students should expect much more.",positive,0.2823,positive,0.19562500000000002,08/06/2019

comments,"It should be noted that ""right to work"" laws deal with the ability of unions who have already been recognized by their employer to negotiate union security agreements into the CBA. In ""right to work"" states, it is illegal for unions to sign a contract with their employer that requires all employees to help cover the direct costs of their representation. The purpose of these laws is to encourage free riding. Regardless, in an organization drive it is not really relevant.

Grad students at Emory operate under a very different set of circumstances. Emory is a private university, so instead of Georgia state law they are covered by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). While historically graduate students were not considered employees under the NLRA (meaning they had no legal rights under the NLRA), in 2016, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which is charged with interpreting and enforcing the NLRA, held that graduate students were employees and entitled to the full legal protection of the Act. Now, with the 2016 election the political composition of the NLRB changed. The new NLRB started looking for cases that they could use to overturn that 2016 decision. In response, unions essentially stopped organizing private sector graduate students, denying a contested graduate student election that the Board could then use to take away the rights to organize from graduate students entirely.

TL;DR: Emory grad students attempted and failed, but it wasn't because of right to work, and it wasn't because of anything they did.",positive,0.3612,neutral,0.03913192071086807,08/06/2019

comments,"The health insurance is *mandatory* unless you can prove other insurance. If a grad student is on another insurance plan, they are probably receiving outside support from family, as you state. I am personally on my parents plan, so I'm fortunate that I don't need to foot the extra cost. Not everyone I know can rely on family to support them though. It disadvantages the most financially vulnerable of grad students. If you have outside family support you're much more likely to successfully get through grad school. Grad students are more likely to leave grad school without attaining their degree if their parents are in the lowest quartile of income earners (23% leave w/o degree) versus the highest quartile (17% leave w/o degree).

comments,"&gt;the reality of the game industry isn't such a ray of sunshine

Who would have thought that over-saturating a labor market with individuals who will accept any amount of money or job conditions would end up with low wages and high stress?

Perhaps incoming students should take this as a sign that their priorities might change when it turns out their ""dream job"" is actually extremely competitive, and that unless your talent is unparalleled you'll be fighting tooth and nail for a low wage job and constant crunch cycle.

No one is going to prop up the indie market out of charity, at least to the level where it gainfully employs people.  But you as a student can honestly ask yourself whether it's worth the gamble of dedicating your efforts towards getting into this industry, or towards going into an industry that pays well enough and has reasonable hours so that you have the freedom of a hobby, which may or may not include game development.",positive,0.9527,neutral,0.0024999999999999944,08/06/2019

Keyword search for ""dual degree"" or ""double major"".

Basically, what they say is that you cannot declare CS as one of your majors until you've pretty much completed the requirements of your primary degree. That means you can't be a CS major in the system until you're ready to graduate with your AE degree. This sucks because then you don't have CS major priority for getting into classes during registration. You can still declare a CS minor after taking CS 1331, which will help you get into some CS classes. 

I believe the only degree that CS lets you double declare with is a MATH. Hope this helps!",positive,0.9489,neutral,0.027678571428571434,08/06/2019

comments,"Hello all!

SGA here! We’ve been spending a lot of time reading these posts and we want to assure you all your voices are heard. As your SGA, we are not only committed to voicing these concerns but ensuring that the construction is reflective of the student opinion. We value the importance of the water feature at the Campanile area and it is a great spot for sitting in between classes and getting a break – no doubt.. There are conversations currently happening around this, with administration and the Student Center Expansion Committee, specifically as to how the water feature design development can begin immediately after Phase II of the construction process. This new construction will allow for accommodating even more people than it in its current form, and although these changes require adjustment and construction requires patience, we are committed to ensuring the new Center celebrates traditions old and new and upholds the student voice.

More information can be read about construction here: [studentcenter.gatech.edu/reinnovation](http://studentcenter.gatech.edu/reinnovation)

Although rank definitely isn't a 100% rating of skill level, it helps me minimize the time for tryouts since the tournament is happening rather soon.

comments,"The Masters in Computer Science (not bachelors 4 year!) degree requires 30 credits. If I take 3 classes for two semesters + 4 classes in 1 semester = 30 credits. I don't plan on finishing the degree in 1 year, so either way, I'll finish in 3 semesters. If I pay part time for 2 of those semesters, I'd pay  ($1,215 /hr \* 6) + ($14,570) = $21,860

vs paying part time for 1 semester and full time for 2 semesters:

($14570 \* 2) + ($1,215 \* 2) =  $31,570.

Whether that's a rational decision is up to debate. On one hand, it's a major burden to society when people severely injure themselves doing stupid things - which is why seat-belt laws exist.

Hodges has a lower GPA for a reason, it's cause he doesn't curve and cause he has some brutal tests. In Dynamics he had bi-weekly quizzes, weekly homework sets, two tests, a project, and a final. 

 * Quizzes were fairly easy and usually just slightly harder versions of homework problems. 
 * Test problems were designed to simulate real world type problems and often each test was three questions with several sub-parts (1a to 1e) that built off each other. Occasionally he would have free-form response questions and multiple choice as freebies.
 * His final exam was brutal and was the first final to make me cry (lol)

Hodges is by far a better professor. I didn't really appreciate him until I took Aeroelasticity with him. He explains things really well and leaves it up to you to connect the dots.

If you’re willing to look outside of BB firms in NYC for IB, there are plenty of smaller PE/IB firms in Atlanta, who target GT students; VC as well.

GT isn’t a target for them but it’s definitely possible to get into a BB as well from GT; you can find examples on LinkedIn.

 I thought he was a pretty decent lecturer, sometimes a little confusing. Tests were hard but usually because I didn't work to get a good enough understanding of material, I found it was important to have a good conceptual grasp because the tests are conceptual (which they warned us about on the first day). Got a B in the class but I feel like I could have gotten an A if I had put in more time. However, chem isn't super important for my major so I decide to put in enough time (maybe 10 hours a week? Not sure) on homework and study and decided that a B is good enough.

Honestly if you're serious about consulting/finance I would do IE (although I may be a bit biased towards it). Your major doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, but many IEs will go into consulting and finance so you'll already have that network there. It's more quantitative than a business major, but less technical than CS. 

Don't do a double major, it's been discussed ad nauseum here and you can search the subreddit to find more discussion on it. Do what interests you the most. It's just four years of your life but it'll be your life for four years. You'll be miserable if you're just trying to min/max and find the most optimal path because there is no most optimal path.

comments,"Oh by ""much cheaper"" I thought you meant you were in-state...honestly if you're spending out of state money and you're choosing between GT and a 20-30% more expensive option that's a target for IB, I'd go with the target if IB is what you really want to do. 

$200k+ is an enormous amount of money to bet on the future success of your career. Especially if the career you want to pursue is in a field like finance where your pedigree matters a lot more than engineering or even consulting at times. 

If I were spending that much money on college and I **absolutely knew** I wanted to go into IB after undergrad, I wouldn't mind spending 20-30% more to ensure that I'll be going to a target school to vastly improve my chances of getting an offer at a BB. But that's just my opinion as a random GT alum on the internet.

It's your decision and it comes down to what you really want to do (and there's a good chance you might decide on a different dream job once you go into college), how confident you are in your abilities, and your tolerance for risk.

comments,"From what I can tell, you're overthinking admissions a little bit. Don't try to be this ill-conceived ""perfect"" student that everyone thinks college admissions are looking for, and don't do many activities where the only reason is to benefit admissions. In the end it's not about how many extracurriculars you do, but more what you do with them. You can be a member of 15 clubs, but if all you do for each is go to one monthly meeting, then admissions really doesn't care at all. Lets be honest, most of the students applying to Tech will have good grades, good test scores, and have been in honor society x, academic club y, and service club z. What will separate you (and what admissions would rather see) is to be involved in an activity you're passionate about, and take up leadership roles in that activity naturally. 

As for getting an associate's degree or not, to be completely honest it really won't matter that much. It's not really looked on much differently than a student taking a bunch of AP/IB/DE courses (also FYI Tech does not prefer any of AP, IB, or Dual Enrollment over any of the others). *Edit for clarity: I'm not saying don't do the associate's, the credits you get from it could be extremely valuable, just the fact that you're in an associate's degree program won't have a huge impact on admissions 

For what courses will give you credit, you can look on the course equivalency database on the registrar's website. 

My apologies if this response comes off as a little harsh, that's not my intent. I see a lot of high school students who, in their pursuit of being the ""perfect"" applicant, remove everything interesting and unique about themselves and turn in into this cookie-cutter person on paper. If each admissions officer at Tech has to read around 1500 applications, what's in your application that makes you different than the other 1499?",positive,0.9911,positive,0.26758620689655177,08/10/2019

There's a reason why A gives credit for an actual course requirement, whereas Principles is just a generic CS 1XXX elective that doesn't count towards any real degree requirement.

Disclaimer: I just took A without Principles. What I know about Principles is solely from talking with my A teacher about it a few years ago.

CS 1301 (McDaniel) - 3 hrs


GT 1000 (Conrad) ECE specific one - 1 hr


APPH 1040 (Rosbruck) - 2 hrs

It's basically 13/14 credit hours, which I've heard is doable for a 1st year. If I get off the waitlist should I take Chen and save my humanities for a harder semester or just bang it out rn and try for a better Diff EQ class later.

It's not a bad class, most of the content were enjoyable and plenty of sources are available online to help you. In my experience, grad students are usually better than long-time professors (they care more imo).

comments,"Looks like a heavy workload tbh. I’d replace MSE 2001 with APPH. (Or start with all 18 hours, see how the first few days go, and drop one)

ME 1770 teaches drawing and CAD, which I found enjoyable. It’s an easy A if you do the work (which can be a time sink outside of class, especially if you’re a perfectionist or new to SolidWorks). 

ME 3322 is thermodynamics, and ME 2016 is computing techniques. Both involve some homework and studying outside of class. They’re the two hardest out of the ones mentioned.

COE 3001 is Def Bods. It’s not as hard as Thermo and 2016, but still needs attention. Especially when it comes to understanding the formula. I got lucky and found a classmate who was a better teacher than the professor, but before that it was a frustrating class. 

Finally, MSE 2001 is one of those that largely depends on your professor. Some make it harder than it needs to be, whereas others are easier. It’s mostly a lot of memorization. It’s not a prerequisite for as many ME classes, and better sections fill up fast. It can wait imo.",positive,0.9467,positive,0.1369356833642548,08/11/2019

comments,"I'll drop the GT1000 class, for 1 credit, it's worthless. 

APPH 1040 hands out As so long as you breathe and DO THE HOMEWORK. I almost got shafted when I missed a SINGLE assignment on the second week of class (1 assignment a week, 2% of the grade each, multiple choice). Dont be like me, panic studying 2 hours before the final, do the homework. And you'll be fine.

I personally dont have any experience with CS 1301 but from the homework I saw my roommate doing, it's pretty simplistic and, if you've ever coded, it should be easy. It's an intro class.

From your current schedule, Phys 1 is going to be the most challenging class, if only for the black hole of time the homework assignments are. Individually, they're basic high school physics but grouped up into 30, 40, even 50 problems a week. It just swallows an entire night by quantity alone. You'll have to plan around the 2 or 3 hour block in which you crank out the physics homework to do whatever else you need to do. It's gonna be the same in Physics 2 (2212) except the problems will actually require a bit of thinking, so about 3 to 4 hour blocks for homework once a week.

ID 2202 is going to be rough trying to get in. It's infamous as a class and every senior is trying to get in to fulfill their remaining humanities requirements. Personally, I'll find a transferable community college credit for humanity to do over the summer like I did. Dont need to worry about grades since transfers dont transfer grades so long as they're C or above. I'm absolute trash in writing essays so Humanities would have been painful.

Overall, looking at your schedule, try to fit in something more rigorous. If not, you'll definitely find these semester pretty easy at the end which is definitely not representative of your next 3-5 years here. Look at your thread [study plans](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/current/undergraduates/academics/plans) and see what you can squeeze in.

Perhaps knock out English 1 or 2 this semester but make sure you check out critique.gatech.edu and the professors for each class.

Even though it is online, part of the class still requires logging in for class meetings twice a week and unfortunately since it is from Atlanta, it was late at night for us to match with their schedule. Twice a week, we had a block of 2 hours from 6-8 (I think physics 2 got to be an hour earlier). Monday’s was group problem solving where you had problems to solve with a group and a TA/professor. While it did help with a lot of understanding problems it did get tedious from time to time.

Wednesday’s were either lab drafts or individual problem presentations (IPP). Lab drafts were an hour block where every person presents the work they’ve done on the lab thus far (labs are done on your own and final product requires a video which is a little annoying). IPPs were just a 15 min block every person was assigned to present the answer to a problem they had to solve. It was nice to have the class for much shorter that day and especially good if you ended up with an early time slot.

comments,"1331 is major restricted until the Friday of Phase 2 because it's the first CS class for most CS majors.

If for some reason a fall admit CS freshman doesn't get a chance to sign up for 1331 during FASET (Phase 1), they can still sign up for 1331 during Phase 2.

While it sucks that you can't start your CS minor, it would suck a lot more if a newly admitted CS major couldn't get their first intro level CS class.

Since 1331 is a pre-req for basically every CS class, not getting that class would likely push back their graduation by a semester (which is not something CoC wants, it's expensive for both the school and the student, hurts rankings, and creates angry students and parents).

The classes I listed above are the only classes I can take because I'm stuck in a weird middle road where I'm  coming in with a decent amount of credit, but I can't take harder classes because there are prereqs that I gotta do first (i.e. Physics 2 and ECE 2020).

When the restrictions do drop, I try to sign up as soon as I can and every now and then I end up on a waitlist but until now I haven't had any issues with not being able to take a class.

&gt; DOES LEGACY MATTER IN THE ADMISSION PROCESS?

&gt; Roughly 6.5 percent of our nearly 36,000 first-year applicants last year had a legacy connection to Tech. We define legacy as having a parent, sibling or grandparent who attended Tech or who currently serve as a faculty or staff member. The legacy admit rate was 15 percentage points higher than our overall average. I understand that some readers may argue, “Well, that’s just DNA at work!” We do value the impact that legacy students have on their class and the overall Georgia Tech community. **In the current first-year class, nearly one out of every five students has a legacy connection.**

&gt; **Because the majority of legacy applicants are not admitted as first-year students, we created the conditional pathway. This is an opportunity to start college elsewhere, earn a 3.3 GPA or higher in specified classes, and then enter Tech as a transfer student the following fall.** Interest in this pathway continues to grow, and over the last three years we have enrolled nearly 400 students through the Conditional Pathway Program.

comments,"About to complete a 4.5+1 (spent a semester working) in ECE

My advice would be to plan out your schedule assuming you should never take more than 4 ece classes a semester. If you can abide by that rule and complete your degree within 3 years than sure! 

Another way of lowering your expenses is to 

A. Become a gta or gra so grad school tuition is free. GTA is undergrad gpa based so kind of competitive
B. Take grad classes as an UG that dont count towards your BS. A MS degree at tech is 10 classes (non thesis). BS/MS allows you to double count two UG so you only have to do 8. Since I only needed 4012 my last semester, I took two grad level ece classes which I didnt need for my BS degree and will be counted towards my MS degree instead bringing my total down to 6. I basically then graduated with my BS and 40% of my masters done! Since Masters tuition is per credit hour until 12. I basically just had to pay for 3 classes for two semesters meaning Im just paying 75% of the masters tuition. Hopefully they still allow you to this by the time you graduate!

amount of effort in so I dropped it. Im taking it this semester to finish off my degree. They do go over the basics so I honestly think you will be fine. You might have to put in a bit extra work but there a bunch of tutorials online and  projects that they posted last year were not bad at all. It might be one of the more easier/chill classes you take (the prof is new so who knows how it will go)

Yeah I took it with Querishi. He also had that “Heavy Programming part” in his syllabus. I think they kind of overhype the programming tbh. The point of the class is computer arch. Programing is just the means to learn how it works. The coding syntax doesnt get too crazy. Its mainly the logic that can be tough

comments,"Hey u/Statek, you seeing this? Don't worry; not a widespread problem or anything. Just an isolated incident. Reminds me of Lewis' Law.

It is demonstrable sociological and historical fact that people of color today suffer from lasting effects of extremely racist policies. Take a quick look at this piece in which you can see redlining of Atlanta (where mortgages were denied to areas of the city that were predominantly black and impoverished) and how that correlates to where they continue to live today, still poorer than other parts of the city. Since buying a house is one of the cornerstones of the American idea of building wealth for a family, this affects people of color for **generations**, especially during economic booms like the 1950s or the broken promise of Reconstruction until 1877. The wealth gap is also demonstrable fact.

My advice would be: make a plan for what you're going to do the rest of the week. The advice to go exploring and such is great, but I think it helps as well to have something specific to look forward to -- like knowing that you're going to check out the aquarium on Friday or something. It doesn't have to be big stuff either, it could just be planning to watch a movie you've wanted to see later in the week. Just something to direct your mind toward other than missing home.

comments,"Basically,

I will be sending two sets of IB scores - Predicteds and Year 1 finals. The Year 1 finals are just a bunch of exams that I take (and scores on these are based only on the paper exams, not the performance on internal class tests throughout the semesters) Since I was really sick, I messed up couple exams and missed one exam - so my score for those exams is a 28/42, or technically 28/35. Since those grades are based only on the papers, I got some messed up scores(4 in English, 0 in comp SL, 5 in Math HL) 

&amp;#x200B;

Second, my predicteds. These are based on Year 1 finals and performance throughout the terms ( homework,attendance,class tests, reports blah blah) I am confident of getting a 38-39+ predicted because I was really consistent throughout the year and I have established that I have a great work ethic in my teachers' minds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Technically, my grades will look really inflated which I am really scared about. I know I can explain it but I understand anyone would be skeptical about me based off my Year 1 finals grades. Its killing me sick because I dont know if I stats wise qualify for GaTech. Should I clarify on my app. that I messed up exams because of illness and since the grades are only based on the exams, I got shit scores??",negative,-0.9805,neutral,0.028968253968253962,08/13/2019

The people who interviewed me were impressed when I explained what CM was and the kind of work I’m doing/wanna do with it. Having both tech and design skills makes you pretty valuable. So in my opinion, choosing CM isn’t necessarily gonna put you at a disadvantage. However I do think that the CoC could do a better job at advertising our major to recruiters, especially at Career Fair because you will find that you have to explain yourself a bit more than a CS major would. My advice is just invest yourself in doing projects you love and seek clubs and opportunities that are related to your interests.

&amp;#x200B;

For CM, you pick 1 of the CS threads listed earlier and 1 of the following LMC (literature, media, and communication) threads:

&amp;#x200B;

Literature, Media, Communication, Interaction Design, Social Justice, Stac

&amp;#x200B;

CS3451 graphics is a solid basis for other game related classes like CS4455 (game design) or Turk's class on Perlin noise covering things like how Minecraft generates worlds.

So far the only LMC classes I’ve taken are 2700 (Intro to CM) and 2720 (Principles of Visual Design) and my experience with both of those was pretty awesome.  2700 seemed tedious while I was taking it but we were assigned multiple projects throughout the semester that were really cool and made great additions to portfolios and resumes. Our final project was all about game development so that could definitely benefit you! 

And for 2720, that class was amazing but it was largely because of how awesome the professor was and the great feedback he gave. Sadly he’s not teaching anymore though :/ but yeah your experience in an LMC class will largely depend on your professor that semester. LMC classes are weird because one class may teach something one semester, and then the next semester that same class could be taught in a completely different way by a different professor. It can be annoying but sometimes you’ll get lucky and get a really good professor and learn things you never thought you would. Also from what I’ve seen LMC classes are much smaller so it’s easier to get personalized feedback on projects.",positive,0.9933,positive,0.15213464696223317,08/13/2019

comments,"I feel you. I've spent far too long at this school and though I've never had suicidal thoughts, the weight of everything has been incredibly difficult during the years I've been at Tech and there are many times I wish I could have just disappeared. For a long time it was so difficult to understand why I even had that feeling of hopelessness or detachment or emptiness in the first place. For a short while, I spent time living on my own in an area away from campus and it made my own depression a million times worse. I felt beyond alone and I was certain I was going to fail out or just give up. 

There's nothing wrong with being a grown man and crying. I'm doing so much better than I was before and I still break down because of this school, more often than I'd like to admit. When I decided to force myself to reintegrate into school life- just to have some people to care about here and a place to feel like I belong- I joined the anime club and their Discord. And while that may not be your thing, there was a group of really wonderful, kind, and passionate people from many different walks of life to just... listen. 

One of the big parts of me getting better was that I could get these kinds of vents out there, as well as talk to people about my feelings. For a while I didn't even attend meetings, and that was okay. There are a lot of different people there and just having a few of them to listen and interact with gave me something to care about, and to be honest, gave me inspiration to keep going. 

It doesn't have to be the anime club- I just suggest finding some kind of leisure-focused club that you find interesting and joining their Discord if they have one... I can't guarantee this will be a solution for you, but I can say that it was a really helpful part of the process for me and made getting better a lot easier. Either way, as someone else who has felt a lot like this before, I am really rooting for you. Don't give up on yourself. You've done a good job getting this far, even if you might not believe it yourself. It's not nearly as hopeless as you've convinced yourself.",positive,0.99,positive,0.16432641432641434,08/13/2019

The course is a collage of random topics from materials science, and the curriculum will never dwell on a single topic long enough to impart any sort of intuitive understanding. You'll be covering xray crystallography one week and then eutectic phase diagrams the next.

It's not a particularly hard class to get an 'A' in, but it's likely that your professor will curve the class at the end and you won't be entirely sure whether you're within the range until the end of the semester. 

Karl Jacob and Hamid Garmestani are considered good MSE 2001 professors. Gerhardt and Wang are not. If the only other options are newer professors, look at their RateMyProfessor and see what their grade distributions look like on this website:

comments,"Copy and paste of my earlier comment. Here's the exact code

Here is the relevant Georgia Code (Title 44 Chapter 7 Article 2 § 44-7-35)

(c) Any landlord who fails to return any part of a security deposit which is required to be returned to a tenant pursuant to this article shall be liable to the tenant in the amount of three times the sum improperly withheld plus reasonable attorney's fees; provided, however, that the landlord shall be liable only for the sum erroneously withheld if the landlord shows by the preponderance of the evidence that the withholding was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error which occurred in spite of the existence of procedures reasonably designed to avoid such errors.

Only reason that can withhold money from your deposit is if they give you a list of damages within three days of the end of your lease contract. I believe they have 15 days (not exactly sure) to get you your security deposit back before they have to pay 3x.",negative,-0.9001,neutral,-0.02857142857142857,08/14/2019

Although Harris is the main ""professor"" you'll never actually see her besides the first day since your class sessions are led by the TA. The fact that you're a first-year shouldn't change the class; as long as you have the physics prerequisite, you should be good to take it.

comments,"As you've probably read, it really depends on your professor for the class. I had Dr. Losego for MSE 2001 in Spring 2019 and it was an enjoyable class. Dr. Losego does a great job connecting the concepts in 2001 to real world applications as well as applications in other engineering disciplines as well. Unlike what I've heard from other 2001 sections, I actually learned a lot from the class and became a more knowledgeable engineer, as most of the concepts were those that every engineer should have some kind of basic understanding of.

For Dr. Losego's section, we didn't really have required assignments and instead 20% of our grade was based on bucket points where doing the online MC homework, participating in class through clicker questions, doing mini projects, Piazza participation, etc. will contribute to your 20% participation grade. Pretty much everyone got their full 20% participation. In addition, we had four multiple choice exams, three midterms and one comprehensive final. Some of the questions on the exams were quite easy, but there are a good amount that would really require you to have paid attention in class and think through the answer choices. Most questions were very similar to homework and in class clicker questions, so being actively involved in the class will help A LOT. That being said, as long as you go to class, pay attention, and do the homework, you're pretty much guaranteed at least a B in the class. It takes a bit of extra effort and digging into the subject to get an A, but as long as you're actively on top of the material and don't underestimate the material, it's completely possible. In addition, Dr. Losego is a great guy, very passionate about the subject and cares for his students.

Regardless of what the lease states for the disbursement method, they are required to give you an itemized list of repairs and their estimated cost within 3 days of your move-out date (or lease end date, whichever is later). You then have 2 days after receipt of that notice to dispute the claims. Then it’s up to them on if they want to repair them and potentially get taken to court, or just not bother billing you. 

Like OP said, failure to comply with this timeline results in the landlord waiving any right to withhold any amount of the deposit from you.

comments,"Since the introduction of CCS (our new national governing body), we no longer host the big end-of-year meet (ECC's). At least for the past handful of years, profits from that event are how half the club's expenses were paid for and allowed us to keep dues reasonable while still covering everyone's practice/meet fees, transportation, and lodging. 

Losing that source of income coupled with huge growth in the team had thrown us for a loop the past 2 years, as we're still trying figure out how to run the club and stay cash neutral without vastly increasing dues. I was treasurer last year and it was definitely our largest challenge. 

Long story short all donations go twords travel expenses, meet entry fees, and lodging for our swimmers; they really do help us keep dues reasonable for college students. We just don't get the large amounts of school funding that other college clubs do, and are largely on our own to figure it out.",positive,0.8583,positive,0.053856231487810435,08/15/2019

An arrogant person believes they’re better / right no matter what. It’s about intent: they look down on others because they believe they’re right or better. They feel smart if someone else feels stupid.

A lot of this comes down to tone and tact, and in my opinion it’s pretty hard to come off as arrogant if you feel the way you described in your post.

For example, if you know something and you’re trying to explain it to someone who doesn’t know, you only come off as arrogant if you do it in a dismissive tone or look.

Most of this comes down to experience with interacting with others, so put yourself out there. Keep your dorm door open, go to all the dorm events, try out different extracurriculars, etc.

* CS 1100 is mostly attendance. There are a few assignments like making a resume and an elevator pitch but it's not very time-consuming.

* CS 1301 I TAd for a while so I'm very biased :) but regardless you have to take it.

* APPH 1040 is easy as long as you get the work done and study a bit for the exams.

* MATH 1554 was a hard class for me and I wish I'd taken it with a lighter load. It's a pre-req for a few CS required classes.

comments,"I think that’s a bit too much. ME1770 is a fun class, but was one of the most time consuming I had my freshman year. For the first half of the course, you’re basically learning how to draw, which isn’t really something you can rush, especially when you’re graded on how well you apply the techniques you’re taught in class. In the second half for the CAD portion, you’ll be spending quite a bit of time at your computer figuring out how to best put things together. You have drawings and projects due every week, and a big group final project and presentation at the end. 

MSE 2001 is a lot of memorizing. It kind of reminded me of AP Bio in that you’re taking in information on how things work; in this case, the characteristics of different materials. It’s not conceptually difficult, but it will take time to remember everything for tests.

APPH and AE 1601 weren’t too bad. Health is pretty straightforward and a lot of it is common sense or basic knowledge, and you’ll only need to spend a little bit of time reviewing more complicated information. 1601 is a fun class, but it’s definitely more work than a 1 hour course should be. I’d count it as a 2-3 hour course, especially considering that you’re already in class for more than an hour every week. It’s an easy class to get an A in if you put effort into it, but it might be hard with such a busy schedule.

COE 2001 was a fun class to me. It’s basically physics of structures in equilibrium, and after about halfway through the course, you’re basically just doing the same work over and over again, but on a larger scale. The homework can take some time, though (at least a few hours each weekend for me), and I really valued spending time on it, because the homework was very similar to the test questions.",positive,0.987,positive,0.07677083333333334,08/16/2019

comments,"**Library Genesis**

Library Genesis or LibGen is a search engine for articles and books on various topics, which allows free access to content that is otherwise paywalled or not digitized elsewhere. Among others, it carries PDFs of content from Elsevier's ScienceDirect web-portal.Started around 2008 by Russian scientists, it absorbed the contents of, and became the functional successor to, library.nu, which was shut down by legal action in 2012.In 2015, the website became involved in a legal case when Elsevier accused it of providing pirate access to articles and books. In response, the admins accused Elsevier of gaining most of its profits from publicly funded research which should be freely available as they are paid for by taxpayers. LibGen is reported to be registered in both Russia and Amsterdam, making it unclear which legislation applies, and whether defendants will show up in a United States court hearing.

comments,"Essentially the idea would be that if someone drops on a Friday, it wouldn't go to the first person on the waitlist, it would just go to whoever is the first to log onto buzzport.

If someone signed up for a spot on the waitlist, but has changed their mind since signing up without going back and removing themselves, then they could prevent the person behind them on the waitlist from registering if their spot were to come up after 4:00am Friday morning.

Imo, GT needs to move 4 (or 4x where x = the number of open seats) spots on the waitlist at a time beginning Friday morning at 8am. Any of those 4 could claim the one seat for 3 hours, before it would move onto the next 4 on the waitlist. The 4 who were offered seats at 8am would still have a chance to sign up after 11am, but now 8 people would be eligible to sign up.

comments,"The complex is a mixed bag. 

I used to live there, and while it's convenient, has decent amenities, and has a nice staff, there are some serious issues that led to me moving elsewhere.

1) the pet owners are terrible. There was frequently dog poop or piss around the property (elevators, stairwells, corridors). There doesn't seem to be any accountability there.

2) the amenities we're almost always under some state of construction, and there was a 6-month period where I was unable to use the pool, clubroom, or fitness center, simply because the contractors got behind and never really finished one project before starting the next one. 

3) the water billing system is rough. Rather than billing tenants individually, they average the entire complex costs and split it amongst everyone. This punishes people trying to be conservative, and it led to me paying +/- $95/month on water. 

4) my unit had a humidity issue that I couldn't really solve (poor seals on Windows and doors).",negative,-0.7277,negative,-0.1127410468319559,08/16/2019

1554 is a bitch, but that's the only truly difficult class on your schedule. Also very professor-dependent.

1102 varies from professor to professor, typically it's an average workload, about what you'd expect tbh.

Your main issue will be you'll need to stay on top of all those classes, it'll be easy to slip up and fall behind if you don't.

comments,"Just to properly hammer it in, READ THE BOOK. Don't just skim it, but work to understand exactly what it's saying, and don't jump around to just find the exact line you need, since it'll make no sense without the context of the rest of that section.

I haven't seen it articulated by the other comments, but projects become much easier to do when you understand what the book is saying. Also, there are times when subjects that appear glossed over in lecture end up on tests, but the topic of the questions were explained in great detail in the book.

As far as other tips...
If you can manage it (and need it), take every extra credit opportunity. The extra credit project, although brutally hard, made the difference between an A and a B for me in the class. 

Go to office hours frequently, just about all of the TAs are really good at explaining what is expected of you for certain assignments. Other students are also very helpful for clearing up certain things. I will warn that there are only so many TAs, and the days before a project is due, there may be so many people in line for help that you'll never actually get to speak to a TA. In other words, start early so you can ask questions early. 

It's hard to explain lecture. Ramachandran is a great lecturer, and it's obvious that he loves the subject. Even so, getting distracted for just a second too long can leave you in the dust. There's a lot of complex stuff to cover and not a whole lot of time to cover it. Really, this ties back into reading the book.

The workload, for me, felt pretty much the same as CS 2110 relative to the other classes I was taking that semester.",positive,0.9907,positive,0.08850174216027878,08/16/2019

comments,"'Spring recruitment' is a misnomer; Continuous Open Bidding is the official term and it is not at all like formal recruitment in the fall. In the spring, sororities may offer some bids, but there is no recruitment week organized by CPC and not all sororities participate from year to year. If any sororities are under the official House Membership Total, they may elect to offer bids up to that number.  Sororities that are looking to offer only a few spring bids usually just issue them privately to girls they already know without any announcement or recruitment events. If a sorority is looking to get more than a handful of spring members then they may hold invited events. If you are in fall recruitment now, try to stick it out because it is really your best chance for joining a sorority. If you are not currently in fall recruitment and think you want to join in the spring, your best bet is to make friends with members in the sororities and see if they start including you in some of their functions this semester, and then you can reach out to them in December to get on their radar if you are interested in a spring bid.

comments,"I suppose I can do that. I like the personal aspect of teaching someone and find face-to-face (or even screensharing) more beneficial because I can repeat an example differently, provide different examples, and answer any questions in the moment. I can also spend more time on areas for you (the user) to use the mac more effectively and skip parts that you’re more familiar with.

Also, the mac session that I gave my prior coworkers took an 1.5 hours. I’m not saying a youtube video would last that long but it definitely won’t be under 30 minutes.

Lastly, an in-person workshop would be a cool way to meet more Tech students (and Mac users!).

That being said, would you still prefer a video format? I’m not completely opposed to it but I think in-person/screenshare is better for both of us. 

Perhaps the best of both worlds is for me to conduct a workshop and record it (with permission from the attendee(s)) so that students can choose which one they prefer. (Btw, I’m also down to give multiple workshops.)

But that’s just gonna get you noticed. Yeah, once all the potential pledges are gone they’re definitely gonna talk about “boner kid”, but is that really enough to secure a bid?  I doubt it. 

You’ve got to be quick, you’re got to be strong. Do whatever you can to get that sausage flopping around. “Hey Chad, check out these sweet jumping jacks!”.  “Aye yo Brian, I heard you ran track, let’s step outside for a quick race!”.  Basically, the more attention your penis gets, the higher your chances of getting a bid. 

If you really wanna lock down that bid, you may want to consider getting physical. Don’t go overboard, things could get awkward. But consider having your little man brush against a brother while you’re in line for food or something. Before he even realizes what’s going down, you’ve imprinted on him. Your mark is forever there. If your erection penetrates his physical space, within his domain, he has no choice but to recognize you as the new alpha male.

comments,"Being on a GT subreddit, you’re likely to get many comments asking “why tho?”. I just think you need to ask yourself why you want go to MIT. If your only reasoning is “they’re the best engineering school” then your mindset’s in the wrong place. If you’ve visited both schools and there’s specific reason for one than the other, then by all means, go for it.

Now as to transferring. It’s definitely been done but realize that it’ll be hard—probably much harder than undergraduate admissions. Grades and test scores will be minuscule in impact relative to things like research and as I said above, why do you specifically want MIT beyond ranking. Also, your high school activities lose weight over time as you enter college (kinda like how middle school became a void when you entered high school). Best of luck! I do strongly suggest giving GaTech a chance though. Both for ROI and maybe easier to get into MIT for grad.",positive,0.9833,positive,0.1580208333333333,08/18/2019

+ JCT Kitchen. Cool southern restaurant on Westside. You can go to Jeni's after.

+ South City Kitchen. Really good southern food by my standards (but idk anything about southern food). Pretty close to campus.

+ Two Urban Licks. Brunch/Barbecue place. Really nice ambiance and view.

+ Bartaco. Good food and drink options. Not super pricey, and you can go to Octane for coffee, Jeni's, or the custard place after.

It's also possible that people have dropped the course and others have filled it from the waitlist back to 72, and that notifications are still being sent out.

In short, calm down and just wait.

As a first year, you're not really expected to have experience but there are outliers. luckily, there's a ton of opportunities for you to get crazy experience like research, competiton teams, internships, etc. the year just started today so you can look into each thing. i'm a third year and wish i did back then, so i hope you listen to me and learn from my mistakes. research/vip is something i recommend to supplement your week courses. competition teams have a lot of opportunities for a lot of majors to get internship level experience as a first year since they all expect a lot from you. there's also opportunities on campus to be leaders like SCA(?) or being instructors in the hive or invention studio. i still feel like i don't know everything on tech, so you have  a lot of room to move in for your career.

a tech degree should get you a job. if you really want one of those big companies, you may need experience like those listed above or something else to set you apart. imposter syndrome is real, and i hope you learn that you're just as qualified as others to succeed but also realize that you need to put in some extra effort to get the highly sought out jobs and that's normal. again as a first year you have a lot room to grow and find something that interests you and expanding on that.

comments,"If your family (or you) can afford it, I'd highly recommend counseling. Psychologist, not psychiatrist - working through grief is a difficult process and it's easier when you have someone who knows exactly what they're doing.

That said, force yourself to remain involved. When I've dealt with loss, I've found that my default is sometimes to become withdrawn and depressed - that's reasonable for about a week or two, but after that, you're only prolonging your suffering. Reconnect with old friends or make new ones. Talk to your friends about how you're feeling - if they're worth anything, they'll sympathize and try to cheer you up. Falling back to your community and having other people around to help you process grief is an extremely important part of healing. Otherwise, you can fall into a cycle where you isolate yourself, are afraid to talk to people because you're isolated, and it turns into a viscous cycle.

Most math classes use the Pearson MyMathLab. Some classes have it included with the class itself, some you'll need to buy an access code (usually bundled with the textbook if you buy it). If you buy an access code it's good for 3 semesters.

A few classes use other programs for homework and your professor will give instructions on how to register if that is the case.

Textbooks are cheapest to find used in a swap group (I don't remember the name) if you'd like a physical copy. You can also rent if you don't want to keep the textbook.",positive,0.7251,positive,0.10416666666666667,08/19/2019

You don't need to do all of it right now--and you'll probably be given instructions for most of it. If you're overwhelmed, only work on whichever one you need to figure out first.

Clubs are definitely a good idea. It's really good to have something that's not classes in your life.

I'll give you my plug for Taido (meets at 8:30 Mondays and Wednesdays) since I'm in it, but there's an online catalogue of all the clubs you can search too, just Google ""gatech clubs"" and you'll probably find it. 

For textbooks that you don't need an online access code with, I'd recommend buying or renting used on Amazon. If it's a class you know you'll need to remember it's probably best to buy, otherwise it's just a matter of preference vs. cost.

Piazza you can usually get to through canvas, which is just canvas.gatech.edu and uses your Tech login. Again, that one isn't a big deal until you get into material and start having questions. It's just a more informal platform for asking questions.

&amp;#x200B;

Piazza:

Piazza is kinda like social media for a class. Different classes use it in different ways, but it's a place where students have accounts and can talk about class material online. Professors and TAs usually have accounts too, so they might answer questions or join discussions. For example, I was writing a lab report and one of the questions asked for data that we definitely didn't collect during the lab. I posted a question on Piazza to ask my classmates if anyone knew we were supposed to collect this. Turns out, no one knew we needed this data, and no one collected it. The TAs then responded online that we could just skip that question without any penalty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Textbooks and Access Codes:

If you like hardback books and can afford them, go for it, but be careful about checking that they come with an access code. If a price seems way too cheap for a book AND the access code, and is closer to the price of just the book, I wouldn't trust it. Used books don't often come with access codes. Personally, if I need a book with an access code, I just buy the electronic book and code directly from the book publisher online. 

I'd suggest only buying books (as opposed to renting) if either (1) you think you'll use it after the class and just want to own a copy or (2) you can resell it at the end of the semester.",positive,0.9836,positive,0.1388888888888889,08/19/2019

As a cyclist it hurts my heart when people don't follow the rules of the road.

1. Stop signs are for everyone ON THE ROAD. Including scooters and bikes.
2. Red lights are for everyone ON THE ROAD. You are not a pedestrian unless you are on two feet if you don't feel safe taking that left turn, hop off your bike and walk it using the pedxing.
3. You make it unsafe for everyone on and off the road when you hop between the two with no warning and you risk your own safety.

Are you willing to put in the hard work to make yourself the best you can be? Are you willing to put yourself out there and take some risks in endeavors you might fail in so you can grow? That's all that matters.

I came to college with barely any college credits (one AP course was offered at my school), my job were all blue collar manual labor gigs, and the only technical experience I had was the little bit of programming I taught myself at home from a book on a old hand-me-down computer. I was WAY behind everyone else there when we started and it was super intimidating. But the redeeming side of that coin was the people I was around were both inspiring and gave me a community that could teach me a TON (both technically, and about life). I went to graduate school and it was more of the same.  Seemed like everyone had done two laps around the track already, and I had barely heard of the concept of graduate degrees. I almost dropped out in the middle because I felt like such an imposter. But again, rather than trying to race them, I built a community that was inspiring and helped me grow. I'm now a professor here, and my career has gone very well (i.e., recognized as a world expert, won major awards, etc.).

Truly, people are going to start from all different places, many times for reasons that are totally beyond their control (e.g., what zip code they were born in). You are here because GT believes you can succeed. So, stop trying to race them and work on figuring out how to squeeze every last thing out of the opportunity you have here. That might mean some netflix as a way to unwind when you need it, but try not to use it as a replacement for engaging what's around you. You may never again have such a protected time for personal growth with world-class opportunities and people around you, but none of that will come knocking on your door....it's easy to miss it if you don't try to go find it.",positive,0.995,positive,0.11931818181818182,08/20/2019

comments,"As with the others, I'd say you should probably drop something.  If you've done a similar course load before at the GT undergrad level, you might be alright, but it looks like a very painful semester.  If you put in the hours (read: all your waking hours, and then some), you could do well with the semester, but you might also have a breakdown and/or burn out super early.

If this is your first semester at GT and you weren't dual-enrolling at MIT during high school, go ahead and make life easy on yourself and drop something.  

If you're gung-ho about making this work, you could try it, but keep an eye on the withdrawal date.  You can drop most of the undergrad classes without penalty before then, so there's no harm in trying (other than wasted time and any stress you pick up).  Don't do something like that every semester (a few withdrawals over your undergrad career is fine, one every semester is not), but it's technically feasible with enough dedication.",positive,0.3784,positive,0.054166666666666675,08/20/2019

I took a maximum of 12hrs every semester and graduated in 3years (+1 summer)

Graduating in 3 made schooling a lot cheaper

Cons:

Less hours doesn’t equal easier. Since dual enrollment took a lot of the easy classes (English, social science, etc), I was left with all the hard classes for each semester.

While I would do it again since I got a great offer from a company I like, I think I got very lucky.

I don't claim this is a complete troubleshooting guide, but it's a couple things that might be happening:

-How's your class schedule? Are you taking so many classes that they take up all your time? Is there one hard class that you didn't realize would be this hard? 
If there's a class schedule problem, there's nothing wrong with dropping one to take it later, especially if you can find one to drop that isn't a prerequisite for later. Better to have a couple good grades than a lot of bad ones and a terrible semester.

-Is it the quantity of tasks that's the problem, instead of the size of them? If you just have a lot of smaller tasks, I find you kind of panic and think it's more than it is, and you end up not doing anything because it's all overwhelming.

-Are you happy with your major? If it's not the course load and it's not the number of tasks, do you just end up doing them slowly because you're not interested in them? If so, it's not too late to switch, you could go talk to your advisor.",negative,-0.2618,neutral,0.013224637681159423,08/20/2019

At KSU with the kneeling buses people in wheelchairs could easily get on and off what more quickly and not get held up for ten minutes while the bus tries to use a motor to haul them up and then put them down.

My GPA really wasn’t affected by this, graduated &gt;3.8 which I was happy with.

Since I graduated in 3 years, I had effectively 2 career fair seasons to get internships/a job (as most freshmen don’t get an internship). As a result, if I was just planning to get a bachelors, I would have one internship under my belt while applying to jobs, which doesn’t allow a lot of room for growth in your skill set and your resume. If you’re competing against students with 2/3 internships for the same jobs, it’s easy to see how they would be more appealing to recruiters. In addition, a lot of students have mediocre first internships, and build up to better companies in their later years, so only having 1 mediocre internship hurts a bit.",positive,0.9762,positive,0.24340277777777777,08/21/2019

I would say apply for a First Year Leadership Organization or ORGT (basically a first year org for outdoor rec) both of which are geared towards 1st years only. 

Get involved in clubs and find out what you're going to do to relieve your stress. Try and find your niche of people to have a support group. But be selective with what you want to spend your time on. Make sure you can focus on your classes. If you're doing stuff to look ""busy"", you're not going to have fun and just waste your time. 

If you overwhelm yourself first semester bc of pressure, you're going to hate yourself and it'll make your time painful here.

While only 7.5% of Georgia's electricity is currently from renewable sources (hydro electric and others), the primary source is Natural Gas:  41%.    The rest is approximately 25% nuclear and 26% Coal and Petroleum.  

This is a big change from 10 years ago where 60% was coal.

Renewables continue to grow, with solar alone expected to more than triple the current (non hydroelectric) renewable percentage in the next couple of years which would get it up to &gt;15%.

I don't know what the environmental tradeoffs of CNG busses vs electric busses being mostly fueled through natural gas are.

There are people I knew as a first-year that already had impressive resumes, 1337 5k1llz, course workloads that would probably steamroll me if I tried them. There are the people who go on to work on startups, get research really early, and do a bucketload of other impressive things. It doesn't stop.

I don't know how I got over that feeling of not doing enough, or being ""boring"" or whatnot. In fact, I probably still haven't completely gotten rid of it. Eventually I think I realized that everyone is at a different place here, and that there's someone out there who's impressed by what you can do. And sometimes, you just haven't figured out what you want to do yet. If that's the case, just try anything you're interested in, and meet lots of people. Talk to those intimidatingly impressive people and befriend them. Then it's not as scary.

Don't worry about being behind, because impressive things take time. Don't rush into the wrong thing in a panic. And a tiny dose of fear is fine, it can be a source of inspiration. Take time to explore your first semester, go to some club meetings, info sessions, workshops, while you're not committed. That's not a waste of time, that's a great use of it.

You went from being taught how to be ""pretty good"" in Java to ""now make C / Assembly your bitches"" and it was quite overwhelming. The few students that hadn't heard of Pointers yet, started dropping like flies. They were left in the dust rather quickly. In 1332, you had to edit methods. It was primarily algorithm based. In 2110, you write files from scratch that could be up to 700 lines. It's a big jump. If you haven't even taken 1332 yet, prepare to have your anus turned inside out and back. It's known as *the* CS weed-out class. This class is the biggest reason CS people change out of the major, hands down.

comments,"It's very common nowadays to change jobs a year or two out of college.  I've done it, many of my friends from Tech did it, so have a lot of my coworkers.  It's just the way of the world now, and companies will hire folks with 1-2 years expirience in a different field.  Heck, these days it's not uncommon for middle-aged people to switch industries.  You're not pigeonholed into whatever job or field you happen to enter first.


If you're just searching Indeed for ""mechanical engineer"" you're likely to see a lot of HVAC and MEP type stuff.  You might try looking at company job boards for industries you're interested in, and see what kind of job titles they post.  Plenty of places hire MEs for jobs without 'mechanical' in the title, or even 'engineer'.


You might not think your work expirience is relevant, but hiring managers won't see it that way.  Maybe to you it was just boring grunt-work, but it's still a real job in AN industry.  Even if it was in sales, or a warehouse, or foodservice, that counts for quite a bit.


Lastly, there's nothing wrong with having a career that's not your \#passion.  Your job doesn't have to define you.  And if you don't like your job, there's also nothing wrong with getting another one.

comments,"1. Go here:  [https://design.gatech.edu/portfolio-guidance-undGo hereergraduate-applicants](https://design.gatech.edu/portfolio-guidance-undergraduate-applicants)  . You are not expected to produce a portfolio as if you have already studied industrial design. They want to see that you understand what it means to major in design and what you will be spending your studio hours doing, and have some skills and aptitude for doing those things every single day, and didn't just pick ID because it sounds cool. They have only recently introduced the portfolio component, and it probably helps weed out candidates who were ill prepared and would switch out after their first semester of studio.
2. It would not be possible to double major in anything with ID. Studio hours are long and tend to spin out into eternity. But you can certainly do a minor or any number of certificates in other areas of interest.  You would obviously lose studio hour credits if you switched majors and would be somewhat behind in the new major.
3. There are some highly respected ID programs at some of the art/design schools. Pratt is the top one that comes to mind. Those schools base admissions decisions heavily on portfolio, while Tech's is optional (but you should of course submit one.) Another difference is that the art/design school curricula are heavy on fine arts, while Tech's is STEM-focused. There are more common classes among majors within an art school curriculum that would count toward a different major if you wanted to switch. All of those art/design schools are private though, with the tuition to go with it. Auburn and Virginia Tech are two public schools that offer ID degrees as well. The problem with Auburn is that you can't start out in ID AFAIK and have to take a summer program after your freshman year and maybe  be accepted into ID and they only take 40, unless that has changed.

I don’t know too much about the ongoing issues with CompE vs. CS as a 2nd year aside from the reddit posts on here but I do see some of the unfairness. For example, CS-specific sections for ECE courses like in 2031 but not vice versa and I don’t think that’s appropriate or fair.

If any other ECE’s wants to work together to meet/discuss/write up a list of these issues, please PM me. Maybe we can take it to the next Townhall with Egerstedt (assuming there is one) or somebody but there definitely needs to be change in the curriculum and standards for a school that promotes Progress as a core value with a highly ranked CompE program. I’m hoping cross discussions between the ECE and CS departments improve as well.

comments,"Heads up - basic game theory assumes that you have rational actors acting in their own best interest.  This requires you to know what their optimization function looks like (for example, in their heads, getting your money could be worth shooting you).  It doesn't matter what you believe or what statistics say, it matters what they believe when weighing the decision (and their anticipated pay off/risk profile may even be unstable and changing with time).  Further, it requires them to act rationally according to their perceived pay off structure.  People make bad decisions for a multitude of reasons, especially when that decision making is over shorter time scales (not just ""in the moment,"" their decision to go mug someone could have been irrational).

comments,"I think the biggest issues are that the CS department is too strict and that it's not really clear from the outside what CmpE means at Tech.

I think the best way to describe CmpE is as a specialization of EE that focuses on computer architecture, digital design, embedded systems, and VLSI.  I took compilers (CS 4240) and plan to take OS (CS 3210) to get a perspective of how software uses a processor.  I think it really comes down to what you're more interested in.  If you're more interested in the hardware that performs computation, choose CmpE and take some CS courses for insight into how software uses computing systems.  If you're more interested in software, including embedded firmware, choose CS.  I remember looking at the SysArch curriculum when I was considering switching, and it can go quite in depth into computer architecture, so, if you're worried about not learning about the hardware if you choose CS, don't be.  I chose to stay with CmpE because I find the actual implementation of hardware (e.g. different kinds of adders, VLSI, layout, and fabrication) quite interesting.

Concerning the CS department being too strict, besides what this post points out, I'll note that I effectively had to take the same class twice (first as CS 2200 and then as ECE 3056) because the CS department won't accept ECE 3056 as a prerequisite for CS 3210.",positive,0.9189,positive,0.25524691358024687,08/22/2019

Most people in good jobs find lots of reasons to stay put (good location/pay/management/experience/company/etc) for at least a few years.

In the current job market for most engineers, your exact work experience (i.e. what you have done) counts as much or more than how long you've been doing it for.  I've been having issues breaking into a couple of industries because my resume doesn't show direct experience with those roles (even though I have worked in/around/with the devices or technology).

If you are about to graduate, I would 100% take or audit those classes and put the skills on your resume.  Even if you don't want to do HVAC or stress analysis, you can always attempt hiding out with number crunching excel/SQL via data analysis or some coding.  Yeah, its just as boring but if you're going to have a job you don't like for a year then you might as well maximize your compensation while you hunt down a better job.

Its going to be very important to try to demonstrate some kind of proficiency and accomplishment in the area you want to go in to.  If you're into robotics then build a crappy robot that shoots free throws.  If you're into designing rollercoasters then build your own magnetically controlled 1:30 scale model.

The real trick nowadays is either networking your way into a position (meetups, makerspaces) or getting your c/v noticed among the hundreds of submissions.  New grads don't have all of these challenges (you have career services to help you and many companies specifically recruit new grads), but taking some of these other steps probably wouldn't hurt.

Mini history lesson from someone who is a current grad student and an undergrad 15 years ago.  it's called under the couch because there used to be a music performance venue literally under the couch building so it was called under the couch based on its physical location so now actually it's confusing that it's still called under the couch but it's no longer in the couch building it's in the student center.

It sounds like you are up at 8:00 every day which is good to keep the same schedule on a daily basis.

Exactly. This is **literally** my point. So how does giving them your stuff help?

If the School of ECE feels that their equivalent courses aren't sufficient, then why not just adjust the curriculum to meet the needs of CmpE majors?

comments,"&gt;I have a sister who attended UPenn (graduated last summer) and she took 30 min walks to and from a special bakery even late at night by herself. I wouldnt recommend that if she was in Atlanta.

Philadelphia has crime too, and anecdotes aren’t indicative of anything. 

I’ve regularly walked from west campus to Sweet Hut by myself at 10-11pm and I’ve never had any incidents. I had a cousin in Johns Hopkins, very close to Baltimore and they didn’t have any incidents. I have friends in Home Park that haven’t been robbed at all. In fact now that I think about it, none of my friends here have been robbed despite regularly going to places off campus.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of students living off campus, walking to dinner and events off campus, going out at night off campus, etc. in any given day. 

Yes there are robberies and there is crime, but it’s not like you’re going to immediately get robbed as soon as you step foot off campus. You’re always going to have that risk living in a city; hell we occasionally even get cases inside campus as well, I remember at least one incident where a robbery happened on west campus (they got caught later).

But statistically, as long as you take some precautions it’s extremely unlikely for you to be robbed.",negative,-0.8085,neutral,-0.020238095238095232,08/23/2019

I went to Antico once, years ago, and before I knew about the questionable issues and previous lawsuits -- as you say, the pizza was meh. 

Authentic Italian food needs to be better understood in this country - I had some of the best meals of my life in Italy, and none of them were pizza. Gnocchi (made properly, not cooked to rubber), venison, pomodoro, real puttanesca sauce (with the egg yolks), whatever that restaurant in Rome did to the polenta to make it amazing, vin santo. Some of it is just a greater cultural awareness of fresh ingredients, but a lot of it is also down to the 2000-year history of cosmopolitan Roman cuisine informing the ingredient and preparation choices. Like, lentils and chestnuts. That combination will never NOT be a life-changing event. 

You can actually pinpoint where Italian-American food traditions compromised, substituted ingredients, and made do with local options, to get to the point where The Olive Garden could eventually be considered ""Italian food."" Pizza improved with the diaspora; other dishes suffered from lack of fresh ingredients (""Italian herb seasoning,"" anyone?), and some remained fairly unchanged.

Sometimes they even do that old-timey Lebanese salad made from fresh oregano leaves. It's literally the home cooking I grew up with.

I haven't been to Baraonda. I don't typically like to eat at Italian restaurants because I think they overcharge for what should be simple, rustic food (that's the essence of Italian cuisine to me).

I’ll be honest, I don’t remember. I want to say in the 3.8 range? It was a 4.06 according to GSU, but plus and minus doesn’t transfer over. GT will re calculate using only the letter.

Yes. If you don’t take all of your classes my the document deadline (not the same as the application deadline for fall admission only) transferring is a complete non starter.

Because I transferred after only one year, I just extended my high school college app resume. They are slightly different from normal resumes but even using a regular resume would be fine.

I was a staff member (RA) and lived in a mold infested room that was my PAYMENT for being an RA, btw it also flooded with water everytime it rained. So everything that I was doing was basically free since my room was  unlivable my first semester and it lead to my chronic illness flaring up for basically the end of Fall semester and Spring semester. So they wouldn’t move me out of the room cause they had no room in the current area (which is fucked up cause it was my payment for work). However, when I moved into my roommates room after she moved out the following semester which I told them I was going to.  So I could sleep in my room and not my couch or my friends room.

comments,"I'm sorry this happened and I know it sucks.  Everybody's talking about pizza but let me offer a little bit of advice.  As a woman, the earlier you start to exercise your voice and demand respect, the better off you'll be.  We're taught as women to be passive and accept a lot of bullshit from men for fear of being seen as a ""bitch"" in this society.  The next time something like this happens to you, check that motherfucker out the gate.  When he asked you if you like threesomes is when you should've asked if he liked chewing without teeth.  But because you let that slide he thought it was okay and took it up a notch.  So then he starts hugging on you and touching you inappropriately.  I'm not blaming you for ANY of this as you're young and inexperienced.  But always know that you have every right to stand up for yourself and demand respect in any situation.  Any man would do the same so don't feel bad about ""hurting anyone's feelings"".  You just have to let them know you don't play that shit.  This man is old enough to be your grandfather and had no business speaking to you like that.  Never mind the fact that he has a whole wife at home with his nasty ass.  You did the right thing by quitting and reporting him.  Good luck to you!

That's why it's impossible to answer ""is this how frats at GT normally are?"". No, people don't normally get tackled. That's the first I've heard of it, and I'm in Greek life.

Again, depends on the chapter. Some party harder than others. All in all, Tech is pretty tame. YMMV.

What we've seen happen is certain client devices after a certain amount of time will just stop passing traffic.

comments,"Using my alt account since I'm about to say some fighting words.

I don't really respect fraternities or sororities in general to be honest. I would never join one myself. I worked as a referee at the CRC for intramurals one semester so I have interacted in some capacity with a lot of the fraternities at tech, which really only reinforced my belief that fraternities are cancer. Some of them are fine to be sure, but a lot are just absolutely horrible. I would stay away from PIKE and KA. PIKE has a reputation for being pretty rapey and KA is just racist. Officiating their intramural games is a horrible experience I wouldn't wish on anyone. 

Those two are definitely the worst imo. Most frats I've interacted with as an official have shown at least some level of dickishness tbh.

What used to be a celebration after rush for the fraternities and their guests has turned into a free-for-all where every student on campus thinks they are entitled to show up and drink all they want at the fraternities' expense. Students from Ga State and other schools try to get in to the parties too, as well as criminals that use the crowds as cover to go through the houses and steal anything they can. All this happened last year and it was kind of rough. Fraternities got in trouble because they are responsible for what happens on their grounds, and kids that don't have any ties to the house don't care. It only takes a few people getting drunk enough to throw up and pass out, or start a fight, or stalk and be aggressive to girls, even though they are uninvited and unwelcome, to get the house in legal trouble and also give them a bad reputation. There is much at stake with these huge parties and enormous liability.

As awful as it is, sometimes reacting to their behavior does make it worse just as not reacting does. Every sexual predator is different and you have to react how you feel comfortable to do so. You put up with as much as you could and then you looked out for you and your mental health and got the hell out of there and now are warning others. Being vocal and looking out for your fellow humans is the best way to prevent others from falling victim to this awful behavior. I thank you and applaud you for your courage! 

One of my many stories was the latter, where I reacted and I put the person in their place and it made it worse. The only thing I didn’t do was tell his wife, which to this day, I still regret. I was 18 and working at my first bar. I loved this bar and am still friends with regulars and coworkers I made there from 15 years ago. My manager was using the owner’s truck while he was out of town. I had driven a coworker home that was drunk and had to drive back by the bar to get to my house. I saw that the owners truck was still in the parking lot and I knew the manager was driving it and should have been long gone by now so I stopped to make sure everything was okay. (Sidenote this bar was the location of a gruesome murder after hours long, long before it was the bar I worked at so I always worried about the closing staff). The manager was drunk and sitting in the owner’s truck trying to compose himself to drive. I hopped in the truck and tried to persuade him to let me drive him home instead of driving drunk. He took this as me coming onto him and he tried to kiss me. He was 30+ and I was 18. He was married with kids and I worked with his wife at the bar. I turned him down and he got mad and aggressive. I got out of the car after telling him off and left. After that, he would come up behind me at work and make horrifically violent sexual comments to me. Like if I was spot sweeping, he would say he wanted to take that broom and fuck me up the ass with it. It was so bad that a table of lawyers heard the comments and quietly pulled me aside to ask if I needed help. I told the owner and said I didn’t want to leave because I loved working for them. They did not fire him, or reprimand him. They did make sure to not schedule me with him. That of course only worked for so long because he talked so much shit about me behind my back that it was turning my coworkers against me.

comments,"To the people sayin boycotting Antico will only affect the employees, the restaurant has already been struggling. Recently, no one has allowed to get overtime, personally my hours were cut from near 40 to \~20. Everyone was advised to get a second job. It's not a secure place to work when you have to worry about if you'll get enough hours to pay the bills because the owners are getting cheaper. We were barely tipped with cash, and all credit card tips were split between employees, with the managers getting an overwhelmingly larger percent.

Additionally, everyone there is capable of finding another job. After I left I immediately walked down the street to Rocky Mountain and they gave me a job, asking me to come in starting Monday, and sympathizing with me for the sexual harassment I dealt with to pay my bills.

No one should have to suffer through working in a sexist, oppressive environment on top of fear of losing their job due to rich males' corruptness and greed.

comments,"Some of these are specific to my experience, but here are the things I have struggled the most with during my time at Tech. I do have a lot of good things to say too! But here are the most troublesome

1) Lack of study space. Literally impossible to find a place to study in the CULC half the time. I feel the study space tech offers in its facilities doesnt meet the demand and need of the number of students during prime testing time or even during normal times in the semester. During finals, CULC and library are completely packed.

2)  The fact that I am paying near 30k a year after scholarships and aid as an OOS student means I should not have to pay a dime to access homework assignments that are locked behind a paywall. Doing so is just straight up disrespect by professors. 

3) Extremely little office hours offered by faculty. Ive only had two classes where I could actually make office hours without missing another class. At my old school, I could walk into office hours for most of my professors near 8 at night as they would hold atleast 6~8 hours weekly vs. most of my tech current professors only having ~1-2 a week.

4) As a transfer, I felt very lost coming to campus in terms of socializing and forming connections. I do not really have  a solution to offer but it would be cool to see more support and opportunities aimed at transfer students. GT2000 is a step in the right direction though.

4)  NRE students get absolutely railed in terms of class diversity, tutoring, and schedule flexibility.

5) Every single department on campus has a different website. They all do use the same portal for login BUT navigating from department to department online is very difficult.  Also, none of them stick to the same format. This was really difficult for me when I first was accepted and had to visit and set up all my stuff for the first time. It made the process confusing enough to be annoyingly difficult. 

6) Quality of buildings and residence halls.",negative,-0.8412,positive,0.05175518925518927,08/24/2019

I highly doubt that sharing a screenshot proving that you have submitted a complaint, with all personal details and information redacted via MSPaint, would in any way derail your case. It would go a long way to convincing me that I should, in-fact, boycott Antico's.

comments,"&gt;because ppl need eVIdEncE to believe victims

This is a big platform you are making these accusations on. Your posts here and r/atlanta have been read by thousands of people. The stuff you are posting can really effect someones life.

Reliability and truthfulness on the internet is really dangerous stuff. There are world governments spreading misinformation. No doubt corporations and big businesses too, along with other big players... This is a small player post, but it should still be handled with scrutiny. A hot story will be read by many, but if that story turns out to be false... often that revelation will not be heard by as many people. It may be the case that the effects of a false story are not entirely reversed.

You are probably being truthful, but yes, if you claim victim-hood, you should have evidence before you incite a mob. The internet has shat on many people's lives. Ideally everyone would be truthful, or we could discern if someone was being truthful with 100% certainty, but we cannot. 

That the internet gives easy anonymity makes this problem worse. In the physical world someone who comes out claiming victim-hood faces repercussions if they are found to be lying, this would probably deter most people from making false claims. Online one can start anonymous, and disappear anonymous.",positive,0.6874,positive,0.11775362318840582,08/25/2019

They give professors a lot of freedom with how they teach their classes.  Sometimes you gain nothing from that, but sometimes you can gain a lot. I've dropped and retaken a fair amount of classes (rip) and it's always interesting to see how different teachers approach the same class differently and you learn different and unique things in each one.

These allegations are complicated by material misstatements in the post.  Antico prides itself as an equal opportunity employer and welcomes any and all persons interested in becoming pizziaolas. We have never fired someone on the spot for entering the kitchen.  
 

Additionally these allegations were made by a person who was terminated for an altercation that took place with another employee on the same shift.  That fact does not diminish the seriousness of the allegations but it does raise questions about the motive for the post.

comments,"You want to apply the semester before you want to take grad classes. So if you want to take grad classes next semester, apply this semester. Usually they will not let you apply until you are a junior.

The deadline to apply is drop/withdrawal day each semester. This semester it is Oct 26th.

Yes, you can specialize in the MS concentrations.

Basically how the BSMS works is, when you are in your last years of undergrad, you take two courses at the graduate level that are crosslisted for undergrad and grad (has a 4000-level number and a 6/7000 level number). It is then counted towards both your undergraduate degree and your graduate degree. For example, if was in the Intelligence thread, I could take machine learning (CS4641), one of my thread picks, at the graduate level (CS7641) and it would count towards both degrees. I could also use one of my undergrad free elective spaces to take a graduate level course (for example CS6601) that does not have an equivalent undergraduate course. If I had taken the course CS4605 (crosslisted with CS7470), I can NOT ask for this to be counted towards my graduate degree.

You MUST be in the graduate section of the class for the class to be eligible to count towards your BS and your MS.

The admission rate for BSMS is 100%, but you must have at least one letter of recommendation from a faculty member (choose a professor that you got an A in their class if you are not super close to any of them).

Once you get into the program, you are still an undergrad student until you graduate with your BS. This will mean you cannot register for graduate level classes in Phase I like other grad students. Instead you must fill out [this form](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Request%20for%20Undergraduate%20Student%20to%20Register%20for%20Graduate%20Course.pdf) for each graduate level class you want to take, and then turn it into the box in front of the advisors offices. After the form is approved (This form will be approved in Phase II), you must go to the registrar's office in Tech tower (or email them) to ask for a level permit. After that goes through, you will be able to register for the class. However, by the time that whole process is completed, there may not be a spot left in the graduate section. There is one way to get around it: register for the undergrad section of the crosslisted class (if it's not crosslisted (same teacher, same time) then this won't work). Then go ask Becky Wilson in the advisors office if she can help you out. She can either move you to the top of the wait list, or increase the capacity of the class for you.

Once you graduate with your BS, you are automagically enrolled in the MS program. This means you are technically a ""new"" student at Tech. The first semester of your MS you register for classes on the last day of the first week of Phase II. For subsequent semesters, you will be sent a survey of classes and request which ones you'd like to take.

comments,"You're right that the 26mph statistic is over the entire Tour de France, which includes a lot of grueling uphills, but 25mph average over a mile is still pretty crazy -- I'm a fairly avid biker with a reasonable quality road bike (faster and lighter than the average commuter bike), and I only hit 25+ on large downhills, which are rarely a mile long. Honestly, I probably couldn't beat 20mph on a mile long flat.

In any case, the average ""daily cyclist commuter"" is not going nearly that fast, unless they all happen to be competition cyclists in their free time. Maybe *you're* going that fast, but I don't think that's true of enough commuters to make it a valid argument against motorized skateboards in bike lanes; I'm sure you have to slow down for or pass other cyclists anyways if you're going that fast.",positive,0.4464,positive,0.08194444444444446,08/26/2019

That's why it's important to do internships and prove to the employers you have experience in and know how to fulfill the job responsibilities.

You don’t have to memorize equations or concepts at work, nor are you expected to; the ability to know what questions to ask so you can figure out what you need to use is far more important. 

Probably the biggest advantage a 4-year degree at a top school is so valued is because it’s a soft filter for companies to weed out unsuitable candidates. By only focusing on target schools, companies let the schools do the bulk of their work for them since top schools already do much of the filtering for them through the application process.

comments,"The administration of pretty much any public college in Georgia is run by conservatives because of the relationship between the Board of Regents and the GA Legislature. Bud Peterson and his replacement Angel Cabrera are both moderate Republicans, both appointed by search committees made up of members of the board of regents, other GT faculty, and business members. Tech may be ""overwhelmingly liberal"" in the student population (it's actually much less so than the average university of our size/stature) but that doesn't mean the administration is. 

As for ""liberal"" organizations getting things accomplished, that's pretty inaccurate. Liberals are not left, maybe in the US they are labeled as left but anywhere else in the world, they're center-right. Liberal groups on campus like College Democrats don't seem to get much of anything done, while leftist groups such as YDSA have led the charge on getting things accomplished on campus, such forcing the administration's hand on improving mental health services. 

Conservative students may face backlash from other students but they have not faced any backlash from the administration, and important distinction that I made in my original comment. 

Here's an article on the surveillance of students, summed up well in this line: ""While experts said in interviews that colleges and universities often rely on social media channels for the pulse of campus, they were unaware of any cases in which an institution had in essence profiled a student -- raising questions about the appropriateness of Georgia Tech’s social media practices."":

Only two can double count, but if the others are fall-through, then they can count for your graduate degree (you would probably want to check this with your adviser first, but I'm like 90% sure this is allowed). So if you wanted to take more graduate courses during your 6-credit semester, it should be possible.

Where did I say that? Where did I provide any sort of advice for marketing yourself to employers?

Those skills are implied when you apply for X job with your Y degree from Z top school, and they're necessary to succeed when you start working. That's why companies recruit from top schools / schools with a reputation for difficult classes (see: GT), because there's a good chance the students from there have really developed those skills.

Of course the rigor of the school and your knowledge of the subject matter is important when applying to positions as well - otherwise why have majors at all? Why not have a psych major work in an aerospace engineering role fresh out of college? 

My point is that while what you learn in your major is important, problem solving, teamwork, responsibility, social skills, leadership, etc. are universal skills that are much more impactful than any specific industry knowledge you might have at this point. By being in a rigorous academic environment surrounded by similar peers, you can develop these skills easier than in a 2-year or less rigorous school.

Because honestly, you're (most likely) in undergrad. You don't have a niche skillset yet. That's something that comes with years of experience applying your knowledge in an industry. You could probably teach yourself all the material for any given major in a year or less if you were dedicated to it, but you don't have any experience applying it in a professional context. That's why internships are so important - you have to prove that you're competent in a real professional work environment, not just an academic one. 

No one is going to trust an intern or a new hire with extremely important technical responsibilities where they have to apply the most advanced concepts of the major they've spent all of 4 years studying the basics of. That's why those soft skills (problem solving, teamwork, social skills, leadership, etc.) are important to develop as well to ensure you can succeed in any work environment.",positive,0.9902,positive,0.19507575757575762,08/26/2019

comments,"My point is it's a balance that, at the entry level, is heavily biased towards the soft skill side. There are so many students with the best technical abilities and similar extracurriculars/background; you need to have well-developed soft skills to market and differentiate yourself from everyone else. It's not something you directly market, but it's something that directly translates to *how well* you're able to market your technical abilities.

I glanced at your post history and saw you're a freshman. I'm not trying to gatekeep here but what kind of recruiting have you gone through for jobs or internships?

When September rolls around, the career fair coming up, and when companies are recruiting for internships, how will you differentiate yourself from the thousands of other freshman who are trying to get entry-level internships as well? Let's say you're a CS major, what have you learned so far in CS 1301/CS 1331 that you can use to really differentiate yourself from the hundreds of other freshmen who are taking those courses and looking for some sort of programming internship as well?

Let's say you differentiate yourself by doing your own side projects and participate in extracurriculars like hackathons/VIPs, and let's say you do them really well. How did you succeed in them? You weren't immediately an expert - you had the **drive** to independently dedicate your time to those activities, the **perseverance** to continue learning when you didn't get it or you failed, the **teamwork** to successfully work with a VIP/hackathon team, etc.

All of this is a moot point if you can't **communicate** your achievements and sell yourself on your resume and in your interview. And even then, if you don't have the **social skills** to connect with your interviewer, or come off in a way that offends them or makes them dislike you, you might not get the position *even though you have the technical skills required for it.*",positive,0.9424,positive,0.18783333333333335,08/26/2019

For more detailed explanations, see: /r/personalfinance, they have a lot of guides and posts there that you can search.

Edit: there’s also many other good options out there (three fund portfolio for one) if you search. Everyone has different needs and tolerances for risk, look up and read guides on the dedicated subreddits and Google around.

I do not know much about fidelity (eventhough my 401k is managed there) but I know that vanguard currently has the lowest expense ratios in the business.  With vanguard (and probably fidelity) you should invest in what are called ""target date retirement funds"" or something similar.  The people are vanguard/fidelity basically do all the hard work of picking the stock/bonds/cash based on the risk profile of your retirement date and allow you to buy portions of the portfolio (called mutual funds).

You might get some clues as to whether this person has direct authorization to alter your job offer or whether instructions are coming from above.

It's hard to give advice without knowing what the issues with the offer are. Is the money lower than normal? Is the work not fulfilling? Is the work you do in high demand elsewhere? How much of a bump is it from your previous pay? Are your responsibilities increasing significantly?

comments,"General electives are classes you can take that don’t have anything to do with your major. You take them because you’re interested in the subject. For the non-ece major elective, I’m not sure it has to be a 2000 level, but I’m not an advisor. I took engr 1211 and 1212 and it’s currently showing up on my degree works as ME1770 in the proper category.  

The ece department just dropped the matlab course from the curriculum but I would strongly advise anyone doing ece to take it anyway. It will really help you. The 1301 class at perimeter is java and the 1301 class at tech is python. Totally different classes but it’s equivalent for some reason.

Someplaces it would mean what you are saying, someplaces it would mean what I am saying. And other places a mix our two, like if there is a law you can't cross a road out of a crosswalk while within so close to a crosswalk.

For GA, since a pedesitrian is allowed to cross almost anywhere, but not impede traffic, I would argue jaywalking, defined as a legal word for GA, would be closer to what I defined.

Also, you are correct in that what you described is not against the law Georgia.

We aren’t patrolling or observing student activity Here. We are simply contributing to the conversation and dialogue.  As you can see, we are very active on multiple social media platforms... Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. 

Engaging with our community is a large part of what we do and if we didn’t have a voice on social media, we would be missing out on a vital and large part of our community. 

We answer hundreds of questions directly asked of us and provide guidance and humor depending on the  situation. 

The GATech sub is really the only Reddit page we engage on.  

I really enjoy being able to meet and interact with students, staff, faculty and alumni here on Reddit! :)

And thank you for engaging with us and continuing a dialogue.

comments,"Hey y'all, I have updates on this shooting and a call to action, which is to please consider attending the Home Park Neighborhood Planning Meeting tonight (Aug 28) at 6:30pm at the new GT Police building at 10th and Hemphill. 

The source of the shooting was a giant party at the former lawyer's office, which is now being rented out on Airbnb as a party house. This is the second time this year that gun violence has erupted from that property as the result of an Airbnb rental party. The first time was back in late January (maybe early Feb, I'd have to look for the exact date) and was a really similar setup. A giant party on Saturday night, cars everywhere, people everywhere, around 2:00 a shooting breaks out, people scatter, APD arrives on the scene, etc.

As a result of this June 23 shooting some neighbors ended up with a bullet hole through their daughter's bedroom wall and you can hear the mag being unloaded in their Nest cam footage in the video: [http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/family-finds-bullet-hole-in-home-after-returning-from-vacation](http://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/family-finds-bullet-hole-in-home-after-returning-from-vacation) The next day another neighbor found a gun stashed on their porch.

Those neighbors have tried repeatedly to get in touch with the owner of the Airbnb property who has been patently unresponsive. We've all been frustrated that our only recourse for handling this kind of thing is to call APD anytime a giant party looks like it's happening at the property. 

However, the City of Atlanta is considering local legislation about these party houses that, IIRC, would allow neighborhoods to put controls in place around these Airbnb and other short term rental properties, and that's one of many interesting agenda points that'll be discussed tonight at the neighborhood meeting.

Living in Home Park, there are gonna be parties. But a bunch of GT students who live here getting drunk and yelling about math and playing shitty music is fundamentally different from people outside the neighborhood coming in and unloading bullets into our houses. (I'm also concerned about short term Airbnb rentals that generally are unoccupied during the week taking away potential long term rental space for students, etc. School's not cheap and the rent is too damn high as it is.)

So please consider coming out to the meeting tonight and/or contacting Antonio Brown our city council representative or the at-large representatives asking them to please support this party house legislation.",positive,0.9302,neutral,0.004779614325068871,08/28/2019

And there is the concept that if you can’t avoid all harm then you should try to minimize it.

comments,"Getting a Big-4 internship is broken into two steps: getting the interview and passing the interview. The first part is based on your resume, and while Tech gives you a huge leg up on uGA people it doesn’t guarantee an interview at all. Make sure you have good side projects/extracurriculars that you can talk about to stand out.

As for passing the interview, make sure you’re solid in your fundamentals (DS&amp;Algos). I recommend grinding lots of Leetcode (IMO skip cracking the coding interview, 1332 should cover a lot of the content).

With that said, a Big 4 job IS NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL! I got interviews with all those companies and failed each (some final round, some first) and got incredibly demoralized. I then interned and got an offer from a startup company with better pay than a Big 4 and an incredible culture. Do not let offers from these companies dictate your life, there are tons of great opportunities out there that might fit you better!

I think your question is best answered in two parts:

**Why is Delta Chi different than ""traditional"" fraternities?:**

Delta Chi selects people in large part based on their involvement in certain scholarship programs. They also (to the best of my knowledge) cut pledges who don't meet a fairly high GPA requirement.

**What are the downsides of this?**

1. It shrinks and reduces the diversity of the pool of potential members.  Being friends with people who may be really different than you is part of what makes the fraternity experience so compelling. Well run fraternities  look for a variety of personality types/backgrounds because it makes the group stronger. That's tougher if there are 50 people you can realistically recruit and all of them have strong commonalities. It's a fair criticism that a number of fraternities do this on some level, but they tend to do it in ways that I think are less harmful to the group dynamic. I would also advise you not to join the more extreme examples of this.
2. It puts an emphasis on being friends with people who can ""help"" you later in life (though I don't think it's actually a very effective way of doing that).  In my opinion, that makes it that much harder to form meaningful relationships.",positive,0.9771,positive,0.23382086167800453,08/28/2019

&gt;Just because you have the flashbacks doesn't mean you have to choose to react to them negatively!

I don't know if you realize this, but this is actually how PTSD is treated in therapy.

&gt;Hell, why do we even have painkillers? If you react to the pain with suffering, isn't that your own fault?

You're gonna get mad at me for saying this: ""mind over matter"". Pain is information before the senses. Like all information, it can be ignored, if you have discipline and strength. Ignoring pain is not always in your best interests, of course. Discretion is key. Usually it is not useful to ignore physical pain.

comments,"So really youre asking why is ours higher than Georgia State and uGA right? Because a lot of these other smaller schools dont need as much money to provide educational services (labs, professors, materials, etc)  and thats a pretty obvious answer.

Also some ideas on why we might pay more based off nothing factual. GT stuff says part of it goes to making labs run. Well Id venture to guess we have more lab space than the other schools. Similarly, hiring the rock star upper end scientists and profs and stuff that Tech does for research and other stuff is probably more expensive than hiring a coach to teach gym class like my brother is taking at UGA. Not to mention paid research positions and tas might come from that idk. There are a lot more peoppe involved in the educational process at Tech than most schools I would bet.

Also a quick google found the bursars website and told me what the fee is, what is goes to, and even why our fees are higher than other schools. So if you wanted to complain to SGA, read the Frequently Asked Questions before you ask a frequent question.

comments,"It's certainly difficult but definitely not impossible. All four of those do actively seek out Tech students and visit for both the career fair and smaller events (like days in the lobby, sponsored events like hackathons, etc.). Having GT on your resume + some impressive background will give you a huge leg up when it comes to landing the interview, though it is a bit random even with that in mind. Referrals are also a great tool that you should use to your advantage if possible, as these make getting the interview significantly easier (e.g. I applied to all 4 last year and the only one I didn't get an interview for was Microsoft, despite them being seen as having the lowest hiring bar of the four... so you can't just count on a solid resume to give you an in all the time).

In terms of the interview, it depends a lot on your experience programming. Without a lot of programming background it will be tough, so study accordingly. I personally did my interviews right at the end of 1332 and that helped prepare me a ton, but looking back I could have put some more work into LeetCode. Also remember that technical interviews can be pretty random and aren't a great signal, so don't feel bad if you don't make it your first try -- almost every engineer I met at Google interviewed more than once before landing the job.

Finally, the ideal year to apply is every year. You don't lose anything by applying now and getting one of these internships early will set you up for the rest of your college career. Good luck!",positive,0.9965,positive,0.1782275132275132,08/29/2019

comments,"**1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game**

The 1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game was the most lopsided in the history of college football, with Georgia Tech winning 222–0. The game was played on October 7, 1916, between the Georgia Tech Engineers and Cumberland College Bulldogs at Grant Field (now a part of Bobby Dodd Stadium) in Atlanta.

With Cumberland opting to punt on multiple possessions, the infamous score can be partially attributed to 97% of the game's plays occurring in Cumberland territory, with 64 of those plays occurring in Cumberland's own red zone.

comments,"I would go study abroad. It'll be harder to find a suitable time once you're a junior and the 36-hour rule would prevent you from doing non GT-led programs. Also, being able to study abroad while you're still in school with other students is very different from only getting 2-3 weeks off (if you're lucky!) once you start full-time and coordinating travel with friends will be hard because they have jobs too.

Having your research on your resume is pretty good, especially if you want to go into research. If you aren't going to do an internship this year because of study abroad, you can also beef up your resume by adding some personal projects. 

Go to the Career Fair, companies in the CoC lobby days, and company events on campus during your junior year to talk to recruiters and hand out your resume. Lots of companies recruit at GT so I think your chances of getting an interview with no prior internship experience should be okay. Passing the interview is another story: be sure to study up on your data structures/algorithms, try to do up to leetcode medium/hard questions, and I found the phone screening interview questions on Glassdoor to be pretty accurate.",positive,0.9734,positive,0.2361111111111111,08/29/2019

comments,"&gt;Georgia Tech expects students *and employers* to honor commitments made during the recruiting process – specifically related to offers of employment [emphasis mine].

I'm glad to see this in an official policy.  Last summer (in 2018), I interned for a certain semiconductor company that makes DRAM.  Last fall, the company gave me a return internship offer, which I ended up accepting.  Two days after I had accepted the offer, the *company* reneged on it.

In the email in which C2D2 announced the new policy, C2D2 states:

&gt;Once you have accepted a co-op, internship or full-time job offer, you should withdraw from the interviewing process, and notify all other employers that you are no longer available for employment.

I would recommend waiting a little while before doing so.  When the company reneged on my accepted return offer, I had not yet withdrawn from another company's interviewing process.  After the first company had reneged on my accepted offer, I scheduled my second interview with the second company and ended up interning there this past summer.  Had I withdrawn from the interviewing process, I may not have had an internship.",positive,0.9524,positive,0.07415352504638219,08/31/2019

Calculus (particularly diffeq) is vital for majors like chemE and AE that rely on applying Nav Stokes and calc does have other applications elsewhere but since graduating I haven't applied calc at all in my work and have really wished some more advanced stats was required for my major (BME). I found multivar and diffeq fascinating but they haven't played the practical role in my life that you're taught to expect in STEM education. Obviously where the emphasis lies will depend on your major/specialization but i think on the whole more emphasis is placed on calc than is useful for the problems modern industry and academia are working on. Which is not to say that you don't need to have a solid grasp on calc to get your degree. Just be aware that that there's a lot of different kinds of math out there and calc is not necessarily going to be the hardest or the most important one for you to understand in the long run.

comments,"I obviously can't speak for other companies, but our internship program isn't nearly as heartless as you seem to think. 

Interns don't help our ""bottom line"" like you're suggesting, interns are expensive. They have to be trained, then most of them go away after 4 months or whatever and we have to train new ones. And on top of that, it's pretty rare to get a legitimately productive intern, because you guys have no experience. 

We hire interns as an investment. Hopefully out of the dozen or so interns we hire this year (many from tech) 4 or 5 will actually be good, then 1 or 2 of those will be interested in working for us after they graduate. 

The rest of the interns will still gain valuable experience and we try very hard to give them the insights they need to have a successful career in this field, no matter who they work for. 

We're not looking for cheap labor, that's easy enough to get out of country or from desperate recent grads. We're looking for future hires, and the by product of that is that lots of interns get exposed to the work force in the mean time. It's a win all around. 

For what it's worth i largely agree with your ""you do you"" approach to employment once you've started your career. But imo you're coming at the whole point of an internship all wrong, and taking this type of approach is more likely to harm your career before it even gets off the ground than it is to really give you any benefit. 

I mean, these are internships, a better offer is likely a couple dollars an hour more for a couple months. Most bridges are worth more than that.",positive,0.9917,positive,0.1834671115921116,08/31/2019

&gt;Students may accept offers before the offer guidelines below, but should not be obligated to respond sooner.

&gt;| | Summer conversion offers\* | Fall offers\*\* | Spring offers\*\*\* |
&gt;|:-|:-|:-|:-|
&gt;| Timing of student decision | October 18 | October 18 OR 3 weeks whichever is longer | March 1 OR 3 weeks whichever is longer |

&gt;\*\* Fall offers refer to full-time, internship, or co-op offers made to students during the Fall recruiting season.

&gt;\*\*\* Spring offers refer to full-time, internship, or co-op offers made to students during the Fall recruiting season.

&gt;Exploding offers (offers that will be retracted or expire in a very short time period) are not permitted by Georgia Tech.

If they don't give you an extension, report them to C2D2 and then consider how badly you need a job.  I would be wary about working for such an unaccommodating employer.",positive,0.09,neutral,-0.021428571428571425,08/31/2019

We don't do interviews or anything, and it'd be awesome if you came by!

But there's nothing wrong with you, I got rejected from an organization my first year, and it sucks but sometimes it takes a bit to find your feet. Just keep trying new things, and reapply if you really want to for next semester.

comments,"So a while ago there was a company based in Atlanta who used to hire graduates so they could fire them along with older individuals so they wouldn't be accused of age discrimination. GT put a stop to that by threatening to prevent them from advertising their engineering jobs here. The company changed their policies pretty quickly. 

Blacklisting can definitely go both ways, and it can often be more harmful to the employer if they make a habit of reneging offers. It's really easy to think that students have no power in these things, but remember that Georgia Tech is invested in your success as well. If their graduates aren't able to find work, or are getting slighted by employers, that negatively affects Tech's ability to advertise itself.",positive,0.9165,positive,0.22833333333333336,08/31/2019

TLDR: guy tries to sell an earpod case. He claims he found it on vacation but of course being the internet and 2 weeks into school viewers assume he found it on campus and refuses to turn it in instead selling it for profit.
