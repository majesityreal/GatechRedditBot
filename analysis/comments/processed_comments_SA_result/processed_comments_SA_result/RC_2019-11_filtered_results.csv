When your HD says that nothing can be done to fix the problem, that's the unfortunate reality of the older residence halls on East campus. They are simply too old and the infrastructure just doesn't support what they need to nowadays. Fortunately, it looks like that will be changing soon, but it might be a few more years until any substantive rennovations or rebuilds are started or completed.

[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/16/suicide-rate-mit-higher-than-national-average/1aGWr7lRjiEyhoD1WIT78I/story.html](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/16/suicide-rate-mit-higher-than-national-average/1aGWr7lRjiEyhoD1WIT78I/story.html)

&gt;The national average for college campuses is roughly between 6.5 and 7.5 suicides per 100,000 students, according to [three major studies](http://www.sprc.org/sites/sprc.org/files/library/SuicideAmongCollegeStudentsInUS.pdf) that looked at undergraduate and graduate student suicides from 1980 to 2009.  
&gt;  
&gt;At least one other local school, Harvard University, has an above average rate for its  undergraduate population. The rate of suicide at Harvard was 11.8 per 100,000 undergraduates over the past decade. When accounting for both undergraduates and graduates, the rate at Harvard was 5.4 per 100,000.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2013, the United States reported 13 suicides per 100,000 people, an increase from a rate of about 11 a decade earlier.  
&gt;  
&gt;Among college-age people, the rate has increased from 11 per 100,000 a decade ago to 11.6 in 2013, according to data provided by the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the University of Pennsylvania, six students committed suicide between the fall of 2013  and the fall of 2014, according to media reports. And at Cornell, six students committed suicide during the 2009-2010 school year.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Globe this month reached out to more than three dozen other major colleges and  universities around the country ‚Äî many of which are identified as peer  institutions of MIT ‚Äî requesting that they share information about the  number of student suicides at their campuses over the past two decades.  As of Friday, only three schools ‚Äî Harvard, Worcester Polytechnic  Institute, and Boston College ‚Äî had provided the data.  
&gt;  
&gt;Twenty-three of the schools declined to participate. Some, including the University  of Pennsylvania, said that their institutions had not collected the data  and had no way of gathering it now; others expressed concern about  comparing figures between colleges, noting that some institutions may  have different standards and methods for collecting data on suicide.  
&gt;  
&gt;The rest of the schools either did not respond or some, like Cornell, said they were still working on the request.

&gt;Over the past decade, at least nine Columbia undergraduates took their own lives, seven of whom were students of color. This comprises a rate  of 11 students per 100,000 student years (a ""student year"" is calculated as a year a student spends at Columbia).

&gt;Nationally, the suicide rate among 15- to 24-year-olds has increased modestly but steadily since 2007: from 9.6 deaths per 100,000 to 11.1, in 2013 (the latest year available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).",negative,-0.7096,positive,0.05166666666666666,11/01/2019

This will turn around. Take care of yourself and be kind to yourself. Tons of clubs recruit in the spring too, so the worst case scenario is that this lasts a few more weeks until after the holidays. You can totally handle that. A few weeks is a piece of cake. 

As for clubs, check out the radio station. I think they pretty much always let people start and they‚Äôre a pretty welcoming group of people (or at least they were before I graduated). If you‚Äôre religious, a lot of those clubs can be a good starting place, and absolutely go to homecoming things for your dorm this weekend.

comments,"School is tough, but know that you don‚Äôt need a 4.0 or really anything too close to it to find internships, there‚Äôs plenty of resources at tech to help you be a better student or learn a particularly tricky class so if you‚Äôve been struggling on your own that might be the way to go

As far as higher commitment clubs, you should check out GT-offroad, we design, test and race an off-road car to compete in BAJA SAE, but more importantly, it‚Äôs been the easiest way I‚Äôve found of making friends. We meet for 9+ hours a week (you do not have to be there for anywhere close to that but some people do), we‚Äôre relatively small (~30 people) so everyone knows each other.

comments,"I have a little bit of a different perspective than a lot of comments i‚Äôve seen here so thought I‚Äôd pipe in

I was really depressed as a freshman and felt that everyone around me had ‚Äúfound‚Äù their circles and I never did. Now i‚Äôm a third year and i won‚Äôt say i‚Äôm ‚Äúcured‚Äù but i have a LOT more going for me now. 

Tech is hard, really really hard. But the opportunities you get here are incomparable to any other experience. As a third year now, I‚Äôve gone abroad, gotten a co-op, I‚Äôm in a really happy relationship and all of those things couldn‚Äôt have happened without the lows

It‚Äôs ok to feel sad and lonely, and it can also be really hard, but if you can use those times of sadness to motivate you to change the parts of your life you dislike. Go abroad, take some classes outside of your major with more discussions as opposed to straight lecture. Your journey has JUST begun, hang in there because as you go through your time it could get a LOT better

An element of college that is really difficult is being on your own, having to take care of yourself by yourself, and overall being an adult. it‚Äôs a huge adjustment and can stir a lot of negative emotions and difficult times but you are LEARNING! Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself, as I‚Äôve seen other people say here before - If you‚Äôre at tech you‚Äôre literally one of the smartest people on the planet! I know this time is hard but once you‚Äôre out your life is set for such success

In any case I never went to class except to see where we were in the material every so often. Homeworks are very proofy but it's essentially the same shit as 1332, I barely studied or tried on the homeworks for that class and got a C. Logical deduction and educated guessing get you a lot further than you'd expect lol.

In regards to syllabus, there isn't one. Grading is arbitrary but as long as you turn shit in you'll at least get a C. Homework questions were graded with a check plus, check, check minus scale when I took it, and you had 10 days to work on each homework, so they're roughly biweekly. Midterm was mid March. Textbook is garbage, I'd recommend using Introduction to Algorithms published by MIT Press at the very least as a cross reference. Class follows the textbook listed in the syllabus sequentially, though (Algorithms by Dasgupta, Vazirani is easy to find online as a PDF).

I've never taken probability theory, but I don't think it'd straight up kill you if you took all three.

However, if you have say 6 easy credit hours worth of classes set aside for next semester, I'd recommend getting 4317 out of the way along with 4107.

comments,"This is a good question.

So blockchain is unique because there is a profit incentive to lie, be wrong, or just overstate results and understate negatives. Actual blockchain is super simple. It can be done in like 40 minutes. The term ""whitepaper"" used to mean something that isn't peer reviewed, so be cautious. Now everyone only publishes white papers and they can't bother for peer review. Whitepapers are written to be persuasive, instead of technical and formal. Everyone thinks you can put garbage into a latex template, and it'll be legit, but its still garbage. 

This is why for the class we choose to focus and good foundations for crypto, and other technologies. Zero knowledge is important for Zcash and newer chains. Multiparty computation will always be important. 

Instead of a final, we will have a research project, 5-10 page paper on anything from blockchain. A lot of students choose to analyze some whitepaper at a level beyond the whitepaper themselves. Some do formal papers, like this one for [example](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/528.pdf) I would say is at the harder end, but not unintelligible to students by the end of the class.

comments,"Oh, so you want to take 1331 as well? That class can be a bit of a timesink, particularly the homeworks. Final homework is the one that threw me for a loop (fuck JavaFX), and I took Java in high school. If you know how to code Java, I wouldn't worry as much, but otherwise it may be a bit more difficult for you. I'd recommend finding a course online somewhere to at least get the general ideas surrounding OOP if it's new to you. Also, from what I've gathered, take the online version of 1331, it seems like it's paced in such a way that all of the lectures leading up to the exam are released, you take the exam, then rinse and repeat after the exam. Plus I just really like online classes, they make life easier in a lot of ways in my opinion.

Anyway, what I was suggesting is, if I were in your position, get 4107 and 4317 out of the way, then take 1331 and whatever else your heart desires that won't cause you to die of explosively high blood pressure.

However, if you don't want to take analysis and algebra at the same time (which would be totally understandable), then I'd go for 3406, 3235, and 4107 all together. With 1331 it would likely be manageable.

In regards to the question about 3406, I may be a bit biased cause if you take the TR section you'll see me there, but it's totally up to you and when you like to get up in the morning.

I decided to look up the professors out of curiosity, you would actually have a good professor for 3235 (I had Bonetto for 3670, he was pretty decent, very Italian) and for 4107 (Heil is the absolute sweetest professor and he's great at explaining concepts, I had him for like a month for 4317, dropped because it turns out CS 4540 is downright murderous with Abernethy, unfortunately 4540 is the one I need to graduate). I can't remember if Belegradek or Loss are good off the top of my head for 3406, and idk the 4317 professor, so that'd be a gamble.

In the end, up to you, but I'd try and get the important shit out of the way if at all possible.",positive,0.9113,positive,0.11298989898989897,11/01/2019

comments,"I have a *little* experience with Java....did take CS in high school and pass the AP Comp Sci A exam (miracle, may I add). Teacher wasn't great so I didn't learn much, but I think I have an okay enough foundation where I won't get caught completely off guard. I've accepted 1331 will be a good timesink for me....I mean, it's gonna be a timesink whether I take it now, next semester, or in ten years.

As for online- in the past online classes have been rough for me as I don't hold myself accountable and procrastinate it. However, do you think the class content for the online version is good enough or better than what I could learn from a professor in-person? I am considering a CS-related minor so I'm not only taking this class for the credit/grade, but also to really learn the material.

I think I'll stick with 3235 and 4107, because like you said the professor looked pretty good, and also because 3235 is a bridging course for other stuff I'll want to take (also bc concentrating in prob/stat). 4317 for next semester

My question regarding the two class times for 3406 wasn't necessarily about waking up early (I have a 10:10 MWF rn and it's just fine)- it's just that I want to make sure if I drop the MWF class right now and get on the waitlist for TR, that I have a high chance of getting into the class. Given it's only phase I, I'm sure I'll be fine but just confirming with you. I'm still a rookie to registering so waitlists get me nervous.... (also, 3235 and 4317 are only offered at one time this semester, and it's the exact same time, so I have to choose and not do both, so no backup plan if I don't get into 3406 TR, if that makes any sense.)

I felt pretty good about those topics. Between the two interviewers I got 2 system design problems (interviewer 1) and 1 coding/math problem (interviewer 2) for the whiteboard segment. It was my first time answering system design questions ever. Luckily the second system design questions revolved around hashing and encrypting plain text and I'd been doing a lot of authentication related work for my internship and class projects, but I felt kinda stumped by the first question which was about relaying and updating data across applications and a db. The second interviewer was really laid back and was cracking jokes and laughing the whole time, but there were still some questions I didn't know the answer to.

I‚Äôm currently a junior and honestly I only have a couple close friends and those are my roommates. My first two years at Tech I completely isolated myself and it really took a toll on my mental health. This semester I decided to try the counseling center because I wanted to try and work towards acknowledging my mental health issues and finding ways to cope with them. Personally, I really enjoy my counseling sessions. It keeps me accountable and it‚Äôs a great place to vent and just seek what I need. It doesn‚Äôt solve everything obvious, but it can really be a great motivator to help push you in the right direction.

I‚Äôve really struggled with making friends here too, and honestly I really only have like two REAL friends after being here for 2 years..but you know that‚Äôs okay. Making friends is hard for some people, and I think it can definitely be much harder when you‚Äôre a freshman and this whole experience is so new to you.

My advice is to hold on. Keep going and try and be positive. Put yourself out there more. Reach out to your roommate. Reach out to the people in your clubs. Try out the counseling center...and even though you‚Äôre not confident in yourself, try your best to push yourself out of your comfort zone. Sometimes the only way to make friends is to do that.

I still struggle with so much and a lot of the time feel like I don‚Äôt have friends...because I don‚Äôt have a massive amount of them..and I don‚Äôt go out to parties...etc...but in reality, the friends that I do have are so amazing and it‚Äôs really more about quality than quantity.

comments,"I can't tell you the difference. I can tell you that I'm in 3210 right now, a semester from graduating, and out of my two degrees 3210 is hands down, unequivocally, the worst class I have taken at tech.  No guidance, hard for stupid reasons, unreasonable workload.  Unless you want to work on operating systems at GTRI like the professors, the class is way to involved.

It's actually graded pretty nicely and getting a good grade isn't ""hard"" if you're willing to put in a stupid amount of work.

My favorite part is the refusal of professors and TAs to help in office hours / Piazza.  They'll just tell you to go figure it out yourself.  Pretty much every instructor answer on Piazza is ""ah I see you don't understand, think about it more"".

A paraphrased quote from a TA when a student asked for guidance trying to figure out how many pages to allocate for something.  Student commented how he was allocating too many pages than could fit in memory (but for good reason).  

""well it's more than one, but less than what you have.  Also if you are only this far you won't finish the lab.  I'm going to bed so no more questions""

The majority of engineers I have worked with did not go to Tech. Many went to local engineering schools in their part of the country that I had not heard of. And yet I met many who were better engineers than many Tech engineers, and also got paid the same salary. The Tech degree is only more valuable in the heads of Tech students and alums. No one else cares that it is hard or that the professors joke about failing students or not giving a shit about them.

My GPA improved substantially after transferring despite coming from a relatively easy school.

comments,"It really does, and I'm so sorry. If this is really what you want, then definitely try again. The worst than can happen is they say no, after all. And don't be afraid to appeal! I know a few people who were denied at first but admitted with the appeal!

I'm a second year, but I had a hard time getting here. I applied early admission into one of the less popular engineering programs as a hs senior and was flat out denied, so I appealed. They told me it'd be 1-2 weeks for that result to come back, and 5 weeks later I was again rejected. And my twin sister got in on her first try, which added a lot of insult to a very deep injury.

I went out of state for my first year and struggled a lot there. I wasn't happy, and I was still hurting from having my sister get everything I ever wanted. And I was in my school's hardest major (ChemE), which exasperated everything. I started the application to transfer as soon as it opened, but I had a lot of issues with it and not being able get answers from anyone at GT. I got it finished and submitted about 2 days before it was due.

Then I got waitlisted. I had a C in calculus 2 and a very low B in general chemistry 2, which they probably saw as a huge risk. I broke down sobbing in those two classes more than once, but I made it through with low As. So I sent the final transcript to GT to show how I had improved over the course of the semester.

I found out over Father's Day weekend that I got in. My entire ordeal still hurts a lot, and I still have a lot of anger and resentment towards GT, my college advisor/guidance counselor from hs (he was a dick who sabotaged a few of my college applications), and even my own sister. But I also had so many great things happen to me out of state. I have friends I consider to be family, and I go see them frequently. My pain was worth it; I was and am exactly where I'm supposed to be. I just had to wait a little longer, and I suspect this is where you are right now. Be patient and don't give up.

Depending on your major, you may take a major hit with just how harsh the workload is. If you're a business student, frankly, it's not too bad. Definitely, as some other people have been saying, try to make some friends. I'm not really one to talk cuz I don't really talk to anybody. Even so, I have 1-2 people in each class that I can talk to outside of class and it helps if you ever miss, or don't know much about an assignment. If you've got friends at Tech already, that's great, try and hang out with them at least once a week. Even though I commute, I still try to fit it in and it's a great destresser.

Sadly their defense shut our offense down. Because if our offense was even remotely competent today, we'd have won easy.

Our defense looked great today and our offense has had its moments this year. I think with continued coaching and discipline, experience, and the incoming top-25 recruiting class we have a solid shot at not sucking in 2021 or maybe even 2020. Keep in mind we never have as good recruiting classes as what we've got coming up, and the current squad is full of players recruited and trained in a highly unconventional offense being asked to adapt a system that's foreign to them. The transition will take some time.

We also have a couple standouts. Skill-wise, Jordan Mason might be a top-5 RB nationally; very few running backs have his vision and his balance. If he were on a good team he'd be putting up Heisman numbers right now. In addition, Ahmarean Brown has shown a lot of speed and talent as a playmaking receiver. I think we have a few tools and we're on the right path, and I'm pretty excited to see our team over the next few years.",positive,0.8087,positive,0.12974603174603172,11/02/2019

There are five sprints after which you present to the class what you've learned and/or accomplished, you write a report for each sprint, and you give peer feedback to other teams for each sprint. By the final sprint, you're expected to have a minimum viable product.

Overall, it's a pretty easy class, but be careful with your planning because I'm currently in something of a pickle with it since people are getting busy and you get a month for the final sprint, so people procrastinate. In other words, get the MVP done or close to done while you have the time if you take this class.

I have no doubt we would have had better defenses and better recruits had the Athletic Directors been willing to spend the money Stansbury is currently spending.

Also remember CPJ was both our HC and OC, which is plenty of money savings right there.

comments,"Plan your internship and co-op semesters carefully!! Certain classes are only offered certain semesters, and this also may change in the future if the department rearranges things. Work with an advisor frequently to stay on track with a plan to graduate in 6 academic semesters!

For example, as of right now, Senior Capstone (4530) is only offered in spring and summer. CHBE 2120 &amp; 2130 are only offered in fall and spring semesters. CHBE 3200 &amp; 3130 are offered spring and fall in Atlanta but only offered abroad at GTL during summer. CHBE 4411 Process Control Lecture must be taken before or during the Process Control Lab, but the lecture isn't offered during summer. 

If you decide to go biotech option (I don't recommend it for graduating quickly as the course requirements are more strict), then CHBE 4310 Bioprocess Engineering is required and only offered in fall, and must be taken after CHBE 4300 (Semester 4 on your list). 

So there are a lot of issues that can arise, especially if co-oping, since that means you must alternate every other term.",negative,-0.2939,positive,0.09516369047619047,11/04/2019

I went to a lot of club meetings that I never returned to, but I'm happy that I went if for no other reason than that I figured out it wasn't for me. I found out what I liked, changed my major, and haven't looked back.

OP, it sounds like you feel unfulfilled from your college life. You say that you ""don't have any reason to improve on yourself, because you're in a relatively good spot,"" but you say that only after you list a bunch of things you'd want to change about yourself, so I'm not sure I buy that (and I'm not sure you do either).

A lot of my own growth at Tech came from being willing to put myself out there and make mistakes, try new things, etc. Tech is great place for it! Atlanta is a vibrant city and Tech has a diverse array of people to meet and things to do.

If you feel like you missed the boat on going out and figuring out who you really are - and when you figure out who you are and you can love yourself for it, those things that you're worried about will follow suit - don't worry! There will be plenty of opportunities to do that no matter where you go after college.

But that's not to say you still can't get started today. There's always something new to experience at Tech - you should make the most of it while you're here.",positive,0.9873,positive,0.26964756258234523,11/04/2019

Things that they deal with might be: death in the family, trying to leave abusive relationship, heartbreak after breakup, managing stress from classes, family issues, difficulty finding friends, etc.

comments,"Yo I have no idea what their policy is then... it very well could be that they will only take long term stuff if they have extra openings at the moment with staff who specialize in whatever the student needs. I last talked to them at the beginning of 2019 so they may have changed their policies since then. They said I needed to go off campus for chronic anxiety/depression. I'm going to talk to them again soon about grief counseling due to death in the family... We'll see what they say.

I think it's really important to remember that many people try multiple counselors/therapists before they find one who really works for them. So **even if** GT had the resources to treat every student who walked in the door, the specific people they have on staff may not even be the right fit for many students. But that doesn't mean they shouldn't let us try. It's unfortunate (and unfair) that you've been blocked off from even trying to develop a relationship with the people in our school's counseling center and see if there is a good fit.

I can't answer how much extracurriculars plays a role but I didn't have any major awards or competitions, not even AMC10/12. I was in Boy Scouts but I'm not an Eagle Scout.

comments,"The premise of that so-called paradox is that tolerance is an absolute metric, rather than a purely subjective one.

One could cast tolerance as not killing the mauve people while we work them to death - we are ""tolerating"" their existence, after all. All of these are incredibly weak arguments for taking away Freedom of Speech that suppose some ""moral authority"" on what ""tolerance"" actually is, and what we must be ""tolerant"" of. 


In other words, the paradox cannot exist because it is based on a subjective linguistic construct rather than an objective scientific lens. It supposes an absolute moral authority that does not exist and should not exist, as that threatens the freedom of all under a system that suppresses creativity simply to ensure that feelings aren't hurt.

You are correct that it doesn't grant you freedom from consequences, except for one detail, which is that Tech is a public school. Since it's run by the State of Georgia, it is under the same obligation to respect the 1st Amendment rights of students and others. It cannot treat people differently, or punish students for speech allowed to others, as doing so would constitute government censorship and a 1st Amendment violation. While the 1st Amendment doesn't protect you from consequences from private entities, it absolutely should protect you from consequences from Tech.

&gt;or a child will be born abnormal.
that depends on how you define abnormal. If we are talking birth defects, they happen in 3% of live births so we can assume they are more common if we include all pregnancies (https://mchb.hrsa.gov/chusa14/health-status-behaviors/infants/birth-defects.html).

comments,"The ""right to free speech"" is a human right and a principle, independent of government.  The 1st amendment only enshrines that right in US law, but to pretend like it ends firmly at the what the government cannot do is to show a lack of dedication to the principle and why it exists.

Power exists, independent of government, in corporations, schools, social networks, communities, clubs, etc.  Free speech is generally not protected by law in any of these places, yet it's principle is widely practiced.  Of course, it needs to be nuanced, but maintaining free speech as a principle makes a stronger and more just society.

Jumping straight to eliminating speech you don't like very rarely has a positive impact for anyone.  If the ideas are really as weak as you think they are, they shouldn't thrive in free and open debate.  Doesn't mean you specifically have to debate them, but clamping down on speech makes it harder for other people, especially those closer in culture to them, to deradicalize.

&gt;I think this is negatively affecting campus life, at least when it comes to random people showing up and protesting extremely outdated beliefs about homosexuals and abortion.

It's not, you're just overreacting.  Guess what?  There are people who disagree with you in the world.  Abortions happen and they're not pretty.  People want you to pay attention and agree with them.  Welcome to the adult world.

&gt;These people do not have the right to walk up to our students to harass them

""Our students""?  You don't own your fellow students, nor do you get to speak on behalf of them.  Speak for yourself.

Harassment is illegal but confronting you with what happens in an abortion is not.

&gt;NOR the right to display very explicit pictures of dead fucking infants

Interesting how you can call the aborted fetuses ""dead infants"", ""gore"", and ""dead babies"", then claim ""you don't need to be graphic to make a point"".  The point of the posters is for you to internalize that abortions are the same as killing babies.  If you don't make that connection, you internalize it as just removing ""a clump of cells"".  Again, I want to keep abortion legal but their reasoning is fairly sound and showing aborted fetuses is totally valid, if not for legal reasons but because they want to discourage women from choosing a abortion for themselves.

&gt;How is this legal and why should encouraging an environment like this in any way healthy? Being subjected to the name-calling, body-shaming, sex-shaming, moral-shaming is not what I came to this campus to achieve. I understand the reason to have a space to allow people to express their believes, but there are boundaries.

You're an adult now.  Grow up.

&gt;I have emailed the dean of students addressing the issue, but if anyone has any constructive ideas about how to approach this, just dm me.

Nothing will change, and for good reason because there isn't an issue to address.  The problem is that you think you're entitled to a ""safe space"", free from conflict.

Co-ed housing would mean that each room is occupied with people who have the same assigned sex at birth, however, multiple genders may live on the same floor of a building. Gender-inclusive housing allows students to share a room with someone who has a different assigned sex at birth and/or gender identity than yourself. In this instance, Gender-inclusive housing would be the best choice in order for your to share a room with your friend.

My biggest issue is they focus on late term abortions (&gt;15 weeks) which compose less than 6% of abortions.  They make it appear like most abortions were late term and wouldn't discuss why these abortions are being sought.

They also discussed how doctors would crush the fetus' skull (true) while leaving out that the fetus was drugged into an unconscious state first.  But them being disingenuous doesn't mean they should be removed from campus.  I only believed they should have been removed from campus for blocking people's paths and assaulting people (verbal and physical confrontations) though I heard they stopped physically blocking/touching people many years ago.

comments,"&gt; Being challenging and being difficult are not the same. 

Exactly! I don't mind challenging coursework, but I do mind the school making my life difficult as a result of malice/incompetence/negligence. It's fine if an assignment is hard to figure out because I'm not knowledgeable about the subject (to an extent, professors do need to teach!) but not fine if the assignment is impossible because of contradictions/mistakes in the instructions or the assignment is broken for some other reason and the professor never bothered to verify the assignment still works before assigning it.

Regarding campus in general, it makes my life much harder when I can't catch a bus because then I have to burn energy and time walking across campus to class, especially if it's very cold, raining, or both. I also strongly dislike when we are harassed by protestors, such as when people put up posters of objectively disturbing medical gore. Additionally, many campus departments are poorly managed. It's not uncommon for the GT post office to give other people packages intended for me or for the SC food court cashiers to overcharge people (last fall I checked my buzzfunds statements and they charged me $9.99 for every purchase).

Once you have said it you can be punished for what you have said. John Adams notably pushed for the passing of a sedition law and succeeded. The sedition law wasn‚Äôt unconstitutional but it was unpopular and that is at least a part of why John Adams was a single term President. It has since become politically nonviable to pass sedition laws as sweeping legislation. The protection against prior restraint isn‚Äôt absolute either. For example, the government can prevent you from broadcasting troop movements or the identities of foreign assets. 

There are other quirks in Supreme Court and lower court ruling that imply some forms of post restraint could constitute prior restraint in the future since it acts as a source of Government intimidation.

We used the poster to cover up pictures of gore and replace it with a joke that made a lot of people's day a little bit brighter. Also i would argue that ""ok Boomer"" is used more against millennials than it is against boomers. it's more about making fun of right-wingers than specifically boomers, and those that get the joke understand that. We've realized that trying to make logical arguments is just a losing battle, so we just use comedy instead.

I wish we could just ignore them as a collective student body, but we all know that's not gonna happen. We might as well respond with dismissal and comedy instead of validating them by debating them.",positive,0.9794,positive,0.4203125,11/05/2019

comments,"3.91 GPA senior, this is my strategy as well.  If I were to rank some of the things you mentioned (aside from the obvious like make sure you eat a lot and sleep, and don't worry about gaining a bit of chub if you're going for great grades)

1. Doing lots of practice problems to prep for tests. This includes reviewing ALL homework and as many old tests as you can. You should be able to look at the questions on the exam and be able to mentally do every single part automatically.
1. Review slides and pay attention to detail. If you're not detail oriented, become detail oriented. Think of how and why questions and be able to answer them.
1. Go to class. Every class. Even if your friends say you should skip 4180 lecture. ECE 3056 potpourri questions on the final were almost all remarks/asides made in lecture. With that said, put your phone down and close your laptop and pay attention. Yes it's very hard but you're also paying too much money to be here. ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. Don't be afraid to nail professors with multiple questions if you don't understand. Chances are everyone else also doesn't understand and they're just afraid to show it.
1. For classes with recitation (especially hard intro classes like CS 1331) , go to the damn recitation. Stop making excuses. Sit in the front row and engage the TAs. Go to help desk if you're not good at programming instead of suffering alone in your room like I did and taking days to do a simple assignment.
1. Email your professor if you're struggling and try to be sincere with them. Let them know you've been busting your ass but you're just not getting it and need more help. They may offer you the chance to redo a homework or two or give your grade special consideration after the final if you show improvement. Be transparent with personal issues, especially illness.

What didn't work for me:

1. Plus sessions
1. Studying in groups (one study buddy is ok)
1. Taking breaks or going out for ""me time"" during crunch time. I've seen this blow up in the face of many of my friends because they decide they don't really care that much about studying and then get fucked by the test. Finals and projects suck but you need to keep pushing to get out of hell
1. Trying to learn math taught in Chinese...
1. Trying to learn MATLAB as my first programming language. I killed the final and got a B somehow? Try to take another CS class first, I think 1301 would have been better for a total newbie like me.
1. Taking grades personally. Some professors, like JH (you'll know him if you have to take one of his classes) plain suck and you won't score well because the exams are ball busters for any number of reasons, including the fact the professor forgot to teach one of the topics on the exam.",negative,-0.9178,positive,0.06593592721641503,11/05/2019
comments,"Sure, but to anyone out of the loop, such as myself after leaving roughly a year ago, it just seems dismissive and divisive. A lot of people are treating boomers as a scapegoat population for issues we‚Äôre having today, and making these kinds of jokes solidifies the perception of such things. I can see why you make the points you make, and to that consider that there is no limit to the dumb distractive jokes you can make.

comments,"Lovely human. Leaving home and reinventing yourself is a challenge. And I'm stoked you're doing it. During my freshman year, I went home more than I should have, because I could. But same to you, I'm introverted. It has never changed. But I found people. Lovely human beings who I have deep personal relationships with, years later despite our differences.

I made friends with a lot of natural extroverts, one especially, who challenged my mechanisms in fun and refreshing ways. Literally, how does being social recharge someone? His bread and butter. Extroverts have stronger networks; introverts have deeper networks. We balance.

The key is to put yourself into situations which challenge your social abilities and withdrawal response. Be open. Have fun. Show up to a meeting for a club of interest even though you're scared shitless. A lot of the introverted finding extroverts comes from us putting ourselves into new positions.

Some of my keys when I don't know what to say have been to ask others about themselves. People enjoy others having interest in them. So when you feel awkward, ask a question, ""major are you studying?"" And listen. Let them answer. ""Cool. I'm studying x."" Talk some. Rinse, repeat. 

Really excited for you to have some time at GT. Also life builds. Adjust your expectations, it never just is like ""poof everything is different."" It builds and you wake up almost 30 wondering when things happened even though you've been there 100% of the time.",positive,0.9923,positive,0.13962121212121212,11/05/2019

comments,"These are just a few general guidelines, but there's a lot of other good advice online.

* Think of your resume like an advertisement for yourself: why should the recruiter pick YOU to move forward in the process versus potentially thousands of other applicants? Modesty is often a valuable trait, but I see too many people underselling themselves on resumes. Don't lie of course, but if you somehow created an app that has 1M+ downloads that has an Internet search engine algorithm beating Google's, generating $1B in revenue, how is the recruiter going to know any of this when all you say on your bullet point is ""Created an app with a search engine to look up information""?
* Start off your bullet points with strong action verbs like developed, deployed, implemented, etc. Make it clear *what* you did, what the *impact* was, and *how* you accomplished it.
* Make your resume easy to read and scan over. People overestimate how much their recruiter cares about them. Think about it, they see upwards of 100+ resumes every day, they probably won't spend more than 5-30 seconds on yours, probably even less if it's badly formatted. It's most preferable to use a predefined resume template as many online ones are successful and easy on the eyes. I suggest LaTeX based PDF resumes.
* When defining what the impact was, quantify it using metrics wherever possible. Instead of saying ""I made this algorithm faster"", say something along the lines of ""Improved \[x\] algorithm with \[y technology\] by 20%/30 mins per day/etc."" or note if there's a monetary gain through your work, if you have access to any of those numbers.",positive,0.9944,positive,0.1901515151515152,11/06/2019

Afterwards it is up to you to practice LeetCode and hopefully you get lucky or if you are just naturally good at CS you will make it through the interview. Practice makes perfect though. 


I practiced over 400 LC questions and by far it was way more important than any of my classes for getting into the big N. If you do not have the time, I'd recommend buying LeetCode Premium and being laser-focused on the questions tagged for the company you are interviewing at.


If you don't know anyone I'd recommend posting on teamblind or getting a referral through repher.me. There are plenty of people who will help you get a referral to at least 1 of the big N in most cases. 


EDIT: By the way, just because you didn't apply early does not mean you have little chance. Keep applying, I know one person who got their Amazon offer at around March so it is never too late.

&amp;#x200B;

Getting a job at a big N company isn't nearly as difficult as it seems - there is some luck involved, but it is pretty doable with a bit of prep. There are two things you need to worry about - getting the interview, and passing the interview(s). Here's what I would do if I were you:

Getting the interview (resume stuff)

1. Make sure different people think your resume is polished - sounds vague, but the best way to approach resume building is to speak to maybe 3 or 4 different people who have seen a good amount, and then look at what changes you want to make. Resume dos and don'ts are really arbitrary with a few exceptions so make sure you focus on ironing out any major flaws. Speaking to different people helps you create something that is flexible and easy to read (easy to read is key). I definitely recommend going to CoC career services.

2. Be detailed, but not too detailed - a few buzzwords for projects are good, but make sure you definitely know what you're talking about. Definitely list technologies alongside the projects you used them for - 'knowing' Java isn't the same as having created something reasonably substantial with java. You need to come across as someone who knows what they are doing. Read what you write and make sure it sounds impressive but not bullshit-ey.

3. For projects, personal projects are good (and almost always beat class projects, unless you designed your own project for the class), but are far more impressive if people are actively using them, or they got you a hackathon win. Make sure the projects listed are cool, or at the very least interesting. Imagine reading the hundredth todo list project versus something that maybe uses a cool algorithm for some image processing - this is the stuff that would make you stand out. Bonus points if the projects you list use different technologies, since big N companies tend to value generalists.

4. Don't use phrases like big data, blockchain or ML unless you genuinely know what you're doing - you don't want to come across as cringey.

5. List your GPA unless it's under 3. (another arbitrary rule I made up - the point here is to always et a second opinion)

6. When speaking to recruiters, be likeable, be yourself, and treat the recruiter as a human being - doing so can't harm you, and people want to hire people that would be good to work with. It's okay to joke around as long as it's in good taste - just don't be that weirdo who prepares jokes about their resume in advance.

7. Referrals - referrals can help, especially if it's from someone you've worked with or someone who graded your work/

&amp;#x200B;

Passing the interview

Firstly, for behavioral stuff, make sure you think over some examples for the generic behavioral questions, but don't memorize or rehearse them - talk through them in a normal way. Having multiple examples for each helps. (I recommend at least 2) Treat it more like a conversation rather than a super serious interview since most tech companies are pretty relaxed, and (at least subliminally) it tells the interviewer you would be a good culture fit.

Remember, any technical interview is also in some sense a behavioral interview, so try to relax, not act like a robot and have fun during your technical interviews as well - it also makes solving the problem easier.

Here's the biggie - preparing for technical interviews.

IMO (and many people disagree with me about this) grinding hundreds of Leetcode questions isn't worth the large amount of time it takes, and doing just a handful for interview practice is very risky. I also don't think it's very fun, and it makes it difficult for me to sit down and do. that being said, you should still do a small handful, but not for interview practice - just so you are familiar with coding in these environments because sometimes companies send out coding challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

There are for aspects of technical interview prep you need to worry about - coding, knowledge, problem solving skills (applying said knowledge) and method.

1. Coding - Choose a language and stick with it. Big N companies tend not to ask language specific questions. If you're a GT student, you're probably familiar with java from 1331 and 1332 so that's a safe bet. Some people say that Python is the best, but comfort with syntax beats number of words written every time, so go with what you know. You don't need to memorize all the standard libraries (ask your interviewer if you can make assumptions about what imports, etc. are allowed), but try to make the syntax as flawless as possible. Practice learning how to write while talking.

2. Knowledge - There's a bunch of stuff you should know, but try not to memorize anything - make sure you can understand it (once you do, you won't forget) and could code it on your own comfortably. More importantly, make sure you could code a variation of it if asked, and make sure you can use it as a tool to solve another problem. You should already have seen this stuff, but I'll put a (non comprehensive) list at the bottom.

3. Problem solving skills - these come with practice, but are not impossible to develop quickly, provided you're practicing the right way. It's less 1332 style memorization and more 3510 style algo design. Looking at coding interview problems and trying to figure out solutions (without spending the time to code each one out) really helps. Don't stare at something for more than 10 minutes if you're getting nowhere since that's a waste of time. If the best solution uses a data structure or algorithm you're unfamiliar with, then your knowledge is lacking, so look it up and understand how it works. The best way to develop these are to schedule mock interviews with friends, and also prep for these mock interviews as you would do for a normal interview, by revising concepts and looking at problems. IMO, mock interviews are the best way to develop these, since just having one scheduled motivates you to do some practice.

4. Method - this is the big one many people forget. You need to do mock interviews to be sure you're properly talking through your solutions, walking through test cases, analyzing time complexity correctly, etc. Doing your first mock interview with someone who knows what they're doing (or even someone who just picked a problem out of a book) can be pretty eye opening, so don't procrastinate on this. Don't forget all the behavioral stuff, and learn to stay calm.

My general advice would be to work through the concepts while peppering in mock interviews. Focus on understanding and getting the confidence to use these as tools to solve problems.

Source: I've gotten internship/full time offers from the big N companies I've applied to. They're not the hardest, and are basically the same recruiting wise as many other companies - people just get intimidated. They tend to have more randomness than other companies though, which really sucks if you get unlucky. I was president of the technical interview prep club for a few semesters, and also TAed for 3510 (that's where my algo prep recommendations come from). This is all based on stuff I've seen myself or heard of from students.

Shameless plug: If you need a reference for time complexity pls look at [bigocheatsheet.io](https://bigocheatsheet.io), and if you're struggling with practicing dynamic programming stuff, pls look at [dynamic-programming.debkbanerji.com](https://dynamic-programming.debkbanerji.com).

comments,"Forgot the topics list lol

If I were preparing for a technical interview, I would make sure I had a solid grasp of these topics, and would schedule mock interviews whenever I could, spending the time in between looking at new problems. Learning all of this stuff isn't necessary, but some stuff is more important than others, and you should prioritize stuff to cover in your non-interview prep time. Also remember that you shouldn't spend all of your time just studying for interviews since that's unhealthy and also makes you worse at understanding stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Stuff you should definitely know:

Linked lists

	\-circular, singly, doubly

	\-be able to manipulate them easily

	\-know common stuff like finding cycles, etc.

Recursion

	\-be comfortable with recursion on numbers, trees, and in some cases sublists/substring

	\-Fibonacci is a must to understand, but avoid the naive recursive solution at all costs

	\-Know common variations of and tricks using bnary search

Arrays

	\-Mostly used as inputs to problems

	\-Know how to approach the target-sum or similar problems (Google it) in linear time

	\-Understand in place vs out of place (for arrays and in general) and try to pick up some array manipulation tricks

Sorting

	\-Know how to sort shit

	\-know how to code efficient sorts

	\-Understand stability, in place vs. out of place

Stacks and queues

	\-Know how to implement, use them

	\-know stuff like parentheses mismatching, queue using 2 stacks, etc.

Trees

	\-binary trees

	\-binary search trees (always ask in an interview if the binary tree you're given is a search tree or not, in the case you can't infer from context)

	\-multiway trees

	\-be comfortable with traversals

	\-be comfortable with recursion on trees

Graphs

	\-DFS - very important. You should be able to traverse graphs, color them, find connected components, etc. You should be able to code DFS for multiple connected components, on different graph representations (not just nodes, but also adjacency matrices, cases where the nodes are elements ina  2d array, etc.) It's not hard to do this if you understand the core of the algorithm, but you'd be surprised how many graph questions boil down to one or two runs of DFS (I got DFS at Jane Street and Google)

	\-BFS - less clean and flexible than DFS in most cases, so DFS should be your go-to, unless you're trying to find shortest paths.

Hash tables

	\-know how to use them

	\-understand when to use a hash map vs. hash set

	\-know the API for it in your language of choice

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Stuff you should know (But definitely learn the earlier stuff first):

Heaps

	\-Binary heap implemented using an array is what interviewers will usually assume you're using

	\-So know how to code it, as well as manipulate it.

More hash table stuff

	\-learn how to code one - it's not that hard and helps you understand it better

	\-I was asked what a good hash function would be once, so having a sense of that is nice

More graph stuff:

	\-know Dijkstra's algorithm I guess? I've never seen it but seems like it could be useful

	\-know Kruskal's/Prim's algorithm - I've seen an MST once or twice, and these are some of the easier algorithms to code for dealing with MSTs

Bit manipulation

	\-know general 2110 bit manipulation stuff

	\-know the stupid missing number XOR trick

Tries

	\-Lead to very clean solutions for many problems

Dynamic programming

	\-Prioritize bottom up over top down - it's cleaner, often jsut as easy, and makes you seem more impressive

	\-Know solutions to some common problems

	\-Be able to reconstruct solutions (with auxiliary tables if necessary)

	\-Most DP problems you'll get are either 1 dimensional, 2 dimensional, or graph/tree based

	\-Nothing harder than what you might have seen in 3510

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

More obscure stuff that doesn't come up often, but can make you seem pretty impressive:

Self balancing BSTs

	\-I've gotten two questions about these - interviewers won't usually expect you to have memorized the exact definition of an AVL tree or a red-black tree, but knowing how to code rotations is helpful.

Disjoint set

	\-I've only used this a couple of times, but if you use a disjoint forest implementation it's dead simple to implement and leads to very clean/efficient solutions

	\-Learn what type of problems they help solve, and how to use them to solve those problems (know how to associate them with nodes using a map or an array)

	\-Maybe memorize time complexity (but not derivation lol) to mention and also so you have an idea of exactly how efficient they are

Even more hash table stuff

	\-understand a linked hash table - these can be very useful and in some cases help you get a time complexity faster than the interviewer expected.

	\-know the nuances of time complexity - it's not tricky and simply mentioning that O(1) is average case and not guaranteed impresses many interviewers. (mentioning advantages of using comparable data also helps)

String searching

	\-I mentioned KMP in an interview once, but Karp-Rabin is probably the only one you'd feasibly be asked to implement, since it's the easiest to come up with on your own.

FFT

	\-I was asked to multiply large integers once and decided to use FFT. The intrviewer said the full implementation would likely be overkill for an interview, so we went with Karatsuba's divide and conquer algorithm instead (she was prepared to walk me through some of that one since she didn't assume prior knowledge of Karatsuba's algorithm)

	\-Don't bother learning this - this is more of an example of weird stuff that could come up in an interview, and how it shouldn't intimidate you

comments,"Is this meant to be portable or is it just for a lounge area or something?

If it just stays in one spot then there's no better option than a regular old PC. Modern ones can emulate PS3 and such but for most retro consoles any PC should be fine.

If it's portable, then there's many options:

Gpd win 2:

* basically a handheld PC, the best choice if money's no object.

* expensive

PSP:

* cheap, &lt;$40

* struggles with some consoles SNES/Sega CD/N64

Smartphone:

* depending on how new yours is they can emulate most retro consoles

* touch screen controls are awful in my opinion

GPD XD:

* excellent hardware for emulation

* a lower spec android

* supports many emulators

MintyPi v3(mentioned already)

* from my understanding they are underpowered, but the new ones mightbe able to handle most games. May struggle above N64/PS1

3DS and PSvita are also options but I don't know to much about them.

We're at Tech - so I get it, we're all used to some ball's busting classes; but just because a class is straightforward and doesn't require a lot of face to face teaching doesn't mean it's a bad class or the professor isn't doing his job. The material simply isn't that difficult to learn, no reason to waste everyone's time by holding class. I've taken the class; he posts all the material online, has a book you can read if you really want to, and he let's everyone know on Syllabus Day he would be lax on whether or not he holds class.

3) a huge part of academic evaluation is based on gpa and there can be a scenario for discrimination based off of whoever has that excel sheet.

great cS offering if you want a job but food service is probably one of the jobs with least down time/job satisfaction there is. You have to remember other departments are more forgiving with rigor of work on the job because they know you‚Äôre a student.

1.) Complete lack of oversight on their dining contractor, just caring about the lowest dollar bid.    It's often said that GT has among the worst dining options of any major college.  And it's overpriced to hell.     

1.5) Obligatory ""fuck PTS"" remark.

2.) Housing has often left buildings lacking very important features for long lengths of time.   Remember a few years back when NorthAve East had numerous false fire alarms per semester solely due to equipment failure and didn't have any working elevators for a 13-floor housing building on many days?   Also see the thread here with people complaining about hot water outages.

3.) Holy hell there seems to be a complete lack of regard for basic cyber security practices.  Evidenced by these ridiculous data leaks.

4.) Some campus services departments are just way to understaffed/underfunded to fill their role.   It's gotten a bit better, but mental health services have been a huge complaint over the years.",negative,-0.8931,neutral,-0.036022727272727276,11/07/2019

1. Was the email sent by a staff member of the Institute Diversity, Equity and Inclusion? It wasn't real clear from the email. 
2. Not sure how much experience others in this thread have in business settings, but mishandling of sensitive data happens a lot out there. I'm not saying leaks happen a lot, but mishandling happens a lot. A lot of companies have likely done better over the last few years at having compliance teams to help with this, but I imagine this is not a large percentage. Almost every office is going to have someone that has emails, Excel files, etc. that contain sensitive data. Nowadays, there's probably not as much SSN and CC# out there in those formats, but I'm sure there's tons of DOBs, address, phone numbers, GPAs, salary info, etc. All it takes is one simple mistake to attach the wrong file, not think to remove certain info from a file, or send an email to the wrong people.

comments,"On campus apartments are $4829 per semester or about $1000 per month. The cheapest off campus housing (within walking distance to campus) is in home park. Rent can be as low as about $550 per month (though that won‚Äôt include utilities so I‚Äôd expect minimally $650-$700 per month). Tech square area is typically nicer than on campus or home park but will also be more expensive than on campus. Any of those places you would have your own bedroom.

Living anywhere in a studio/ one bedroom is going to be a lot more expensive than living with other people. However, you can easily end up with really bad roommates if you don‚Äôt have people you know to live with, and if you‚Äôre living off campus there‚Äôs really nothing you can do about it. For that reason, I might recommend living on campus at least for the first year. If you decide to go the home park route, make sure you see the place and meet the roommates before you agree to anything because these living situations really can vary wildly.",positive,0.7757,positive,0.05711279461279463,11/07/2019

comments,"He prioritizes democratic reform. Without a solid democracy, we can‚Äôt get anything done. With voter suppression, voting rolls purges, outdated voting systems, an overpoliticized judicial system, foreign interference in elections, and the spread of misinformation, etc.. we need to address this first so that popular policies can actually pass. 

His extensive knowledge and expertise in foreign policy. US legitimacy is eroding abroad thanks to our current administration. Pete has experience abroad in the Middle East and understands foreign matters, evidenced by his big foreign policy speech in June. He is committed to ending endless war in the Middle East, rejoining the Paris Accord, and rejoining the Iran nuclear deal.

He brings a voice of unity when our country is increasingly divided. The day the Trump presidency ends, which is inevitable assuming our democracy doesn‚Äôt totally collapse in the next 5 years, what will this country need? We‚Äôre going to need a leader who can bring the country together in our effort to undertake bold solutions, not pitch the two sides in a fight, political or moral. He‚Äôs able to frame progressive ideas in ways that are appealing to moderate or conservative voters. I believe this is key in winning back voters in the Midwest/South.

There‚Äôs other things too, such as his student loan forgiveness program (he‚Äôs the only candidate with a negative net worth, thanks to student debt), women‚Äôs agenda (especially regarding reproductive rights), and his Douglass Plan in tackling racial inequality.

comments,"Thanks for the response. I'd like to make a few comments here to lightly push back on a couple things:

On democratic reform: completely agree those are all issues that need to be dealt with, but keep in mind, the largest voting bloc in the US are people who don't vote. The best way to start to get things done is to advocate for ideas the masses want instead of the corporate interests that Washington has become beholden to. Pete, however, welcomes and seeks out big dollar donors which leads to many questions -- for example, how can I trust that someone's health care plan is in the best interest of all Americans if the health care industry in its current form is helping fund their campaign?

On foreign policy: Pete is by no means committed to ending the wars we've waged around the world. This is a vastly important issue to me as well, but he's even said he would keep troops in Afghanistan, a country we have been stationed in for nearly 20 years without reason. Also, it's almost definitely a stretch to call him an 'expert' in foreign policy.

Lastly on the unity paragraph: Sure I will grant you that he *sounds* like a voice of unity, but once you get past the surface level, what does that even mean? Hillary also *sounded* like a voice of unity, but had nothing of substance to offer to regular people in the Midwest (or to anyone except the donor class for that matter), which led to Trump's win.

comments,"agree to disagree ig. I know Pete isn‚Äôt the most popular candidate at gt, esp on reddit. I‚Äôm pretty solid in my support and just wanted to find some other supporters.

also, to add counterpoints: 

Pete isn‚Äôt funded by the healthcare industry. He‚Äôs refused to accept corporate pac money. Simply bc a lot of his donors work in the healthcare industry (as nurses, technicians, doctors etc) does not mean the industry is funding him. They are just regular working people. I think it‚Äôs a good sign that people who work in healthcare support him and his plan. His average donation per donor was around $30 for q3. 

Pete is definitely committed to end wars. He‚Äôs proposed an automatic 3 yr sunset on every authorization of military force. He‚Äôs stated he‚Äôs committed to withdrawing all troops from Afghanistan by the end of his first year in office and only have counter terrorism operations in the Middle East.

From the polls, it‚Äôs evidenced that Pete appeals to a broad audience, from liberals to conservatives. Being from the midwest himself, Pete understands a lot of the pain and problems the people there are facing and in fact had to work firsthand to solve them as a mayor in South Bend. I‚Äôm also from the midwest and there is a big difference between South Bend and many other industrial age cities, due to Pete‚Äôs revitalization efforts.",positive,0.8999,positive,0.11398809523809524,11/07/2019

For u/kuangdrew : SPI is an interface where you connect the SCLK, MOSI, and MISO lines together to every device, and then select which device you're talking to using the chip select line. In your case, you'd need 3 pins from the mega to act as SCLK, MOSI, and MISO (and there are probably hardware SPI pins already assigned), and 3 pins, one for each sensor, to act as chip select. You'll have to read the datasheet to see if they're active high or active low, which will tell you whether to write a digital high or a digital low to activate each chip.

Hurley v. Irish American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557 (1995), is a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States regarding free speech rights, specifically the rights of groups to determine what message their activities convey to the public. The Court ruled that private organizations, even if they were planning on and had permits for a public demonstration, were permitted to exclude groups if those groups presented a message contrary to the one the organizing group wanted to convey. Addressing the specific issues of the case, the Court found that private citizens organizing a public demonstration may not be compelled by the state to include groups who impart a message the organizers do not want to be presented by their demonstration, even if the intent of the state was to prevent discrimination.

You realize Trump is the moderate, almost left-leaning Republican, and the people breaking with him are the Neocons?  Jacob Chambers describes himself as a Rubio/Ryan conservative.  These are the types of politicians who:

* Believe life begins at conception so all abortion should be banned, including in cases of rape or incest.
* Believe it is the responsibility of the US military to stabilize the rest of the world, overthrowing regimes and propping up others.  The types that were cheering on the Iraq war as a way of nation building and want the US to get actively in the middle of civil wars in Syria and Turkey.
* Want gay marriage to be returned to being illegal because of their religious beliefs.
* Want to eliminate social safety programs entirely, if possible.
* Believe in free trade at all costs, including the extreme deflation of wages and increasing unemployment

Trump isn't perfect, but on all of these issues he's very much the least traditionally conservative Republican we've had in modern history:

* Clearly doesn't care about the abortion issue but says what he needs to to not have the pro-life people go crazy.  Probably just wants to keep the status quo, with banning late-term abortions but never banning entirely.
* Clearly on the withdraw side of removing the US from foreign conflicts.  He was willing to take out ISIS, but come on, those people were modern-day Nazis and directly threatening the western world.  The Turk/Kurd/Assad/FSA conflicts he's tried to stay far out of, except to punish war crimes with the use of chemical weapons.  Again, there's room for criticism, but Trump is the least hawkish of the Republicans.
* Largely embraces gay people.  Sure, Pence doesn't have the same track record, but Trump is holding rainbow pride flags on stage.  You won't see Ryan or Rubio do that.
* Hasn't tried to significantly squash safety net programs.
* Wants to renegotiate trade agreements so that US workers are paid more and have more jobs available.

Trump's biggest campaign promise is reducing illegal immigration, which is endorsed wholesale by every administration before him going back to Reagan.  The only difference between him and them is that he actually takes it seriously and is trying, harder than any of them, to get it done.

Illegal immigration and free trade with countries with exploit their citizens are the two biggest things impacting wealth inequality.  People can't demand better pay because companies will move abroad or hire workers under the table.  The only reason these jobs aren't ones ""Americans want to do"" are because they pay so little with poor working conditions.  If Americans were the only choice of businesses who need employees, it's a worker's market to demand higher wages and working conditions.",negative,-0.9881,positive,0.05709383753501399,11/09/2019

the organization clearly attracts people who take a little too much pleasure in the job - [a facebook group for ICE agents had to be removed for the way they were talking about immigrants and anti ICE politicians](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/customs-and-border-protection-investigating-secret-facebook-page-where-agents-allegedly-mock-migrant-deaths/), and that group had 9500 members, which iirc is like half the total number of ICE agents. not to mention the countless cases of people visiting their border camps and saying they're essentially torture.

obstruction of justice: not debatable when the president is actively telling people to reject subpoenas, admitted on national tv that he fired comey because of the investigation and so much more

rejection of veterans and 9/11 survivors: it wasnt the democrats who voted against healthcare for first responders in 9/11 or apporpiaton bills for veteran women and so on

Money given to campaigns from the NRA is now complicitness in Russian collusion? Not updating election system is complicitness in collusion? Bullshit.

Russia‚Äôs biggest interference in the election was political ads and targeted advertising. Not actually hacking the actual election machines.

If you aren't aware of history, that's on you, not me. 

it's funny how you appear to care about freedom but are ignorant to how class stratification in America limits your freedom. The truth is, if you are living paycheck to paycheck trying to feed your family, you aren't free. You don't have the same opportunities as everyone else. You can't go to school and you can't pay medical bills, not of any fault of own, but that you are poor. You are just trying to live under a system that really doesn't give a fuck about you. But then again, the people who don't want the status quo to change are often the same people who directly benefit/aren't hurt by the current one. So I don't blame you for not wanting systemic change. But if all life is about oneself and one's own particular set of beliefs, never challenging one's own opinion and being uncaring to the plight of others, that's a sad world that I don't want to be in.

Protests in Hong Kong are about fighting against an oppressive system of control. So on that point, I agree with you. I wish we were less complacent than we are. The same ideas of limiting speech (ex. Withholding federal funds from clinics that talk about abortion as an option) exists in our country too. We are just okay with it because our lives go unaffected, until you find yourself on the other end the sword. what's important here isn't ""socialism vs capitalism"", what's important here is fixing the problems we live with, and I believe more socialist policies would lead to a better America.

You came from Tech and id expect more critical thought than just ""I am helping society by designing a new processor that will help Qualcomm improve its earnings this year!"". Yes, I agree with you that as engineers, we have the ability to help society. That means that it becomes more important to think critically about who benefits from what we do. Do you think that a dried-up coal town in Appalachia can afford a new bridge that they need? No, they can't.

Even a broken clock is correct twice a day and I have my doubts as to whether Jacob's (or those who still remain loyal to an ideaology which is more concerned with preserving station, privilege and power than responsible governance) moral compass will serve him any better in the future than it has thus far.

comments,"**Immigration Act of 1924**

The Immigration Act of 1924, or Johnson‚ÄìReed Act, including the Asian Exclusion Act and National Origins Act (Pub.L. 68‚Äì139, 43 Stat. 153, enacted May 26, 1924), was a United States federal law that prevented immigration from Asia, set quotas on the number of immigrants from the Eastern Hemisphere, and provided funding and an enforcement mechanism to carry out the longstanding ban on other immigrants.

The 1924 act supplanted earlier acts to effectively ban all immigration from Asia and set a total immigration quota of 165,000 for countries outside the Western Hemisphere, an 80% reduction from the pre-World War I average. Quotas for specific countries were based on 2% of the U.S. population from that country as recorded in 1890.

comments,"&gt;However, immigrants should not be blamed solely for jobs going away.

It's extremely hard to blame immigrants for wanting to move to the best country on the face of the planet.  How could I blame them, especially when there are lots of people here doing everything in their power to make them feel welcome.

No, I blame the left for actively supporting open borders.  I blame them, especially the rich and middle class democrats, for actively encouraging them to move to the US so that they can feel better about themselves.  Either they don't care or won't listen if it makes things harder for lower class rural and suburban Americans.

Many of them are contemptuous of Trump-voting peoples without a college degree.  It is painfully clear that they show more compassion and humanity to illegal immigrants from foreign countries than white Americans who live in poor trailer parks.  They don't care about the disharmony it creates in the lower rungs of society because they don't have to live near it, and quite frankly, they benefit greatly from the cheap labor.  I don't want them to care about these people because they're white, I want them to care about these people because they are their fellow citizens.",negative,-0.3642,positive,0.1445616883116883,11/10/2019
comments,"Quoting myself:

&gt;There's a difference between ""shutting down"" an event by chanting, using noise makers, storming the stage, etc., and challenging a speaker's lies from the audience. Of course, if they're challenging them every other minute on the speaker's opinions it's the same as a ""shut down"" tactic, but if it's used sparingly then the audience might be better off. This is especially true if they challenge the speakers during a Q&amp;A period.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's a fuzzy line, but a threat of ""offering a counter-narrative"" shouldn't get you banned from an event, while a threat of ""shutting it down"" would absolutely be grounds to ban a potential attendee.",negative,-0.5776,positive,0.16439393939393937,11/10/2019

comments,"Unfortunately none of you will be able to take a class from this prof since I believe he was the victim of a change in leadership at GT, but Dr. Pradeep Agrawal (ChBE) was my favorite professor during my tenure at Tech. 

He was the head of ChBE undergrads and took it upon himself to stop teaching Junior/Senior courses and teach the first ChBE class. My goodness was that class a beast and was he relentless. However, he was an incredible teacher who held hw sessions every Friday in addition to regular office hours. He made sure that anyone paying attention would understand the fundamentals of ChBE when they left his class, something that you used in literally every class, no exception. To me the fact that he was obviously very busy as head of undergrad ChBE but still took all that time for us really spoke to his character. His tests spoke to his sadism (jk that‚Äôs just Tech). 

It didn‚Äôt end there though, every semester I met with him, since I formed a personal relationship with Dr. Agrawal, to adjust my schedule and make sure that I stayed on course to graduate in 4 years, kept my grades up, and talk about what I wanted from the program. 

Dr. Agrawal nominated me to the Student Advisory Board for ChBE, gave me the opportunity to be a student that met with the Executive Advisory Board of ChBE, and informed me of all available scholarships for the programs around (which were few and far between). 

I credit whatever understanding I have left of ChBE to him (I ended up doing a less traditional job out of school and am now pursuing an MBA). Overall my relationship with him is what guided me through ChBE and helped me figure out what I wanted to do in life. It‚Äôs truly a shame he left Tech. 

A close second would be the prof I researched for during my Sophomore and Junior years (total of 5 semesters). I‚Äôll keep the name anonymous since his group was small and would probably reveal me, but basically I had the scientific method pounded into me along with critical thinking and an understanding of how to collaborate with a diverse group of talent. All of those are incredibly important skill irl. 

Basically what this comes down to if you want a prof to make a real impression on your life is MAKE RELATIONSHIPS. It‚Äôs trite, but also true and I‚Äôd encourage everyone to try it. Remember that they are busy and may not be open the first tine you approach them, however, nothing worth having is easy to obtain.

comments,"Sorry, but gas chambers and ethnic cleansing are *not* necessary requirements for a concentration camp. I really don't understand why people act as if that's some sort of gotcha - it's not. You don't need to be literal Nazi Germany to have concentration camps, and it doesn't detract from the horror of the Holocaust to say that these migrant detention centers are concentration camps. We have the capacity for nuance. The way those children were/are treated is/was wrong. Full stop. We don't need to argue about this.

I agree on China. The Chinese people are wonderful, but fuck the Chinese government and any person or corporation too scared to speak out for what's right. The Uighurs and the Hong Kongers deserve to be heard, even if it's a little inconvenient for our wallets.

I also agree that the immigration problem is complicated and complex and I definitely don't pretend to have all the answers. But you better believe if I were in charge those kids would have fucking soap and blankets. And I wouldn't try to make myself feel better about it by pointing at the other guy who couldn't quite figure it out either. That shit is weak, we're better than that.

I think I'd start by decriminalizing and regulating most drugs (let's go ahead and free and forgive all of our non-violent drug offenders while we're at it). No more income for the cartels. If they want to make money, they must become legitimate businesses and stop murdering people in the streets. Bring the worst offenders to justice of course, but give the rest a path to real, honest jobs. Give them something to lose.

Cut off the (American) drug money and I bet the Mexican and other Latin and South American governments would be able to get the cartels under control. And I bet without cartels, people wouldn't feel the need to risk their lives crossing the fucking Sonoran desert to ""take American jobs"". 

I live out here, it's fucking brutal, even during the more forgiving times of year, I can't imagine what dire straights I'd need to be in for such a journey to be the logical path forward. And I bet once people don't feel threatened in their own homes, if you give them a chance to breath and collect themselves, I have a hard time believing they'd feel the need to make that journey, that sacrifice. And, by the way, isn't it funny how the farther you get from the boarder, the louder people seem to get about illegal immigration? It's almost like they have no fucking clue whatsoever and are just looking for a boogeyman and a talking point.

And if I *really* wanted to crack down, I'd go after all the people *hiring* the migrants, not the migrants themselves. They're the real victims here. They just want a chance to earn a slice of the American lifestyle. Nothing wrong with that. If you were in their shoes, wouldn't you? The (obvious) problem here is, once we actually crack down, we quickly realize why migrant labor is a *good* thing, legal or otherwise (maybe this is a good opportunity to re-think what it means to be an illegal immigrant?). Good luck affording an American to do back-breaking labor like that, and with no migrant labor, say goodbye to a massive chunk of our agricultural output. *We* need these people just as much as they need us, and we should respect them and treat them right.

The other thing I'd do is stop fucking around in their politics. It's *their* government, not ours, we have no right to interfere. If we want to spread the American way of life, *show* them why they should want to be American. Actions speak louder than words. Give aid to the *people*, not the crooks at the top. Air drop that shit in there. Make them like us. I dunno, throw some Kanye in an aid package, use that big ass military we keep wasting our tax revenue on to deliver it. How do you get more American than that?

All of this would take time of course. But if we'd stop yelling at each other about the scary brown people coming to take our jobs (it's their land, by the way, the Mexicans lived down here way before we ever did; also, what about those caravans we were so concerned about around election time last year?), and stop acting like the victim when we're actually the problem, and start working to address *root cause*, I bet we could make real progress within a few years, and solve the problem within a decade or two.

I dunno, man. I'm an engineer, not a political scientist. We can do better than this, though. Start with the fucking basics...",negative,-0.9918,neutral,0.009734530175706638,11/11/2019
comments,"I am sad to say no professor at Tech had an impact on my life outside of tech, but there were professors who I learned a lot from and who I still remember fondly, because they actually made an effort to teach. (This was not my experience with the vast majority of professors, so it either speaks highly of these few professors, or really badly about Tech as a whole ).

The professor I remember most fondly was Stephen Ruffin in AE. I was a regular at his office hours, and even though I didn‚Äôt ace the classes I took with him (I‚Äôm pretty average by Tech standards) I learned more than I did in some other classes which I did ace. I asked a lot of dumb questions and he never made me feel stupid, just made me walk myself through the solution by asking me questions. The only other professor I had a similar experience with was Seitzman (also AE); his lectures weren‚Äôt always great but in office hours he always made me realize it was a good idea to have stopped by.

I‚Äôve also had professors who gave me smart ass answers when I asked a question they considered dumb, or ones that made it clear they were not really interested in teaching, and a decade later I am still resentful of them.",negative,-0.5861,neutral,-0.0019505494505494404,11/11/2019

comments,"A concentration camp is: ‚Äú Concentration camp, internment centre for political prisoners and members of national or minority groups who are confined for reasons of state security, exploitation, or punishment, usually by executive decree or military order. Persons are placed in such camps often on the basis of identification with a particular ethnic or political group rather than as individuals and without benefit either of indictment or fair trial. Concentration camps are to be distinguished from prisons interning persons lawfully convicted of civil crimes and from prisoner-of-war camps in which captured military personnel are held under the laws of war. They are also to be distinguished from refugee camps or detention and relocation centres for the temporary accommodation of large numbers of displaced persons.‚Äù

By definition ICE isn‚Äôt running a concentration camp. The immigrants are getting a fair trail and are being held lawfully due to breaking a law that‚Äôs not based on ethnicity or political group.

China is running concentration camps for the Uighers. Literally raping, dismembering, organ harvesting, and lab testing them against their will. All due to their political and religious beliefs. 

We are not treating those in the care of ice within even 1/10th the cruelty of China or Nazi German.

As for cartels. You know they do much more than just drugs. They also do human trafficking and mob style ‚Äúprotection‚Äù stichks. Even if drugs are decriminalized they‚Äôd still be selling them. California and Colorado still have huge black markets for weed. 

As for our foreign policy. The us uses is strength to change international policy in our favor. We tried isolationism once and it ended in ww2.

comments,"Back in 07-08, I was an undecided RAT, and Dr. Derek Tittle taught my intro to microeconomics course. He made it fun and interesting enough that I decided I wanted to study economics as my major. Later, he also took over as academic adviser for the School of Economics, and sorry to say, the previous adviser was clueless, so he had a great impact when he took over and actually helped me pursue a math minor, when before I was planning on taking very little math (whoever let us think that advanced math wasn't important for upper level economics was horribly misguided). So he definitely had a huge positive impact on my academic career.

But overall, I'd have to say the professor with the biggest impact on my life was easily Dr. Jerry Ulrich, the choral professor. He's crazy and hilarious and awesome, and helped me really fall in love with singing, and was certainly responsible for facilitating my development in leadership and organizational management in my four(ish) years with the Glee Club.

comments,"Assuming the dean's office(s) had access to all of the information.... I see this entire episode as the Institute playing defense via offense.    Given that a GT faculty/staff member basically crashed and disrupted YDSA's event (according to reporting on this issue)... that leaves GT administration in an odd spot.  Few public colleges want to acquire a reputation as a place where their employees  go out of their way to actively inhibit or bully students.

By penalizing the student organization, they put YDSA on the defensive to focus their energies on protecting their autonomy (and forestalling more censure) rather than drawing attention to the event in a way that would embarrass the faculty member and prompt questions of her department/supervisors from GT administration.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how YDSA is structured, but i'm guessing that its helmed by students who have other fish to fry besides starting the process of lobbying the dean and GT administration to investigate the faculty member's behavior.  This way, YDSA gets to feel like they are vindicated by dodging a bullet, and GT is free to quietly suggest that the faculty member exercise more discretion in the future.

The reasoning that the other poster didn‚Äôt mention is because of how the old HVAC systems work. Particularly buildings that use boilers.

He was an AE professor here back when I was an undergrad; he's now the director of JPL Planetary Exploration Program. He researched how to land spacecraft at Mars.

It was Spring semester Junior year. I had been planning on taking the summer off to deal with some depression (I had taken classes the other summers). But before I left for the summer I wanted to line up some undergrad research for the next year. I read through all of the profiles of the professors on the AE website to see what their research was. His was the most interesting and I had done something somewhat similar at a former internship, so I sent him an email asking if I could work in his lab in the Fall.

I got a response that said essentially ""Victor, you seem like you'd be a great addition to the lab. However, I need someone who can do an internship at NASA Ames this summer. Are you available?""

That was it. There was no interview with NASA; he just essentially gave me an internship at NASA after an email and a phone conversation. That internship looked good when I applied to SpaceX the next summer. And through him I met my graduate school adviser where I did similar work. I currently work in the field of atmospheric entry. I owe a ton of my career success to Dr. Braun. He made Georgia Tech worth it.",positive,0.9699,positive,0.17763157894736842,11/11/2019

comments,"I think it is very inefficient to have classrooms locked like that.

Such a wasteful use of space.

I remember when we were debating with the library about their decision the get rid of cubicles and shrink the amount of quiet areas (they supposedly have changed course and now say that when the other half of the library re-opens we will get back what was lost).

But through the whole debate, I kept thinking that there is actually a huge source of quiet areas to study on campus: EMPTY CLASSROOMS, it is just that they are sometimes locked, or you never know if there is class about to show up.

And the same goes for collaboration work: EMPTY CLASSROOMS

I think it would be great if there was an app that let you find unused and unlocked classrooms around campus, near you, and would let you know when class was going to happen.",positive,0.5791,positive,0.08630952380952382,11/11/2019

comments,"Can't speak for GT. But like I said, nothing should be taken away from the efforts of second place and beyond teams. In fact, if I'm recalling correctly, the gap between top 3 or 4 and the rest was far larger than the gap between 1 &amp; 2.

The trikes are designed for kids. Getting them to where they can support college students for a 4 mile race, while also staying within the rules is not trivial. Not to mention pushing the damn things is surprisingly hard. Finishing at all is commendable.

Then there's the teams that go above and beyond. That's those top 4 or so. Not only do they finish, they're not limping the last lap by any stretch. They've considered not just how to make a trike that survives, but a trike that goes fast. And they're always noticeably on a different level.

And lastly there's the team that's won the past two years. This is literally their thing. They don't do any other homecoming events. I hear they hold tryouts for who gets to actually race. They probably spent a pretty penny on getting that trike to work like it does. They're definitely deserving of the praise from the Institute for their effort (with the caveat that any times reported should be factual).

All that to say, don't feel bad because you got second place. Or third or dead last. Getting a trike across the finish line at all is a minority accomplishment and a helluva effort.",positive,0.9802,neutral,0.021014492753623194,11/12/2019

It seems very suspicious that they would be using this type of data for targeting students for a ""lunch and learn event with one of our corporate partners who provide internships/coops/employment opportunities to our students"". I wonder if someone could make a case for discrimination, specifically with regards to ethnicity.

On the other hand, if they weren't using those attributes then there was no reason for them to have a file with those attributes. That is indicative of a systemic problem! FERPA information should all be behind a tightly controlled interface and not just sitting around on spreadsheets. Then, if you need a list of names and emails, you can run a query that only returns names and emails. If you need a list of names and emails of students above some GPA threshold, then you can run such a query without returning the individual GPAs. Some people will have a legitimate need to run more in-depth queries but there should be clear warnings against running queries for more data than is required. This is how it is done in industries with data protection laws (e.g. HIPAA). Data access is logged, and the logs are routinely audited. If you didn't have a need to access that data, then you are legally responsible and your employment may be terminated.",positive,0.6063,positive,0.07601190476190475,11/12/2019

You're not going to win a lawsuit here. Almost everything they do is targeted to underrepresented minorities. A company going to them to recruit is not ""discrimination"". They regularly send stuff out like this. Get on their mailing list, and you'll see it.

Now I could just respond to the sender and leave it at that, but then 2 or 3 days later I might get another email from my manager or the sender‚Äôs manager asking whether the question has been answered, which is something I would like to avoid.

IANAL, so I would recommend consulting with a class action lawyer first and determining whether an endeavor like this would actually be feasible and what the potential payout could be.

The state shall have no liability for losses resulting from conduct on the part of state officers or employees which was not within the scope of their official duties or employment.  
&gt;  
&gt;(b) The state waives its sovereign immunity only to the extent and in the manner provided in this article and only with respect to actions brought in the courts of the State of Georgia. The state does not waive any immunity with respect to actions brought in the courts of the United States. 

They'd almost certainly argue that releasing private information was not in the scope of Georgia Tech's employee's official duties or employment, and thus the state would have immunity.",positive,0.1494,negative,-0.051700680272108834,11/12/2019

&gt; ""Loss"" means personal injury; disease; death; damage to tangible property, including lost wages and economic loss to the person who suffered the injury, disease, or death; pain and suffering; mental anguish; and any other element of actual damages recoverable in actions for negligence.

I think it would be hard to equate the loss any student suffered with the value of free tuition. As a settlement, maybe?

If things are going really bad, you can even defer a semester, take some time off to focus on yourself and get back.

Like yesterday I actually studied for a midterm that I need to get an A on in order to maybe get an A in the class, and I aced it today. I‚Äôm just lazy most of the time. But the real problem is I have no way of decompressing. All my ‚Äúfun side projects‚Äù are basically just more work and frustration. Weekends feel like a Tuesday or Thursday because I have basically no classes, and all I do is HW or those projects, which aren‚Äôt even for employers or resumes literally just my twisted idea of fun. In the entire week I maybe do something completely unrelated to any form of work for maybe 3-5 hours (excluding eating/sleeping).

The projects and other random shit are kinda meaningful to me but at what cost? Am I just going to throw away this time of my life just to get stuff done and not actually have other kinds of fun? Education is meaningful to me but after coming to college it‚Äôs literally the only thing I‚Äôm doing. Just going to class, sometimes going for food, and the rest of the time working. Even over winter break I‚Äôm studying for and advanced standing exam and over summer break I‚Äôm taking a community college class and studying for another exam.

comments,"All the girls I met at Tech were through mutual friends or proximity.

Met one by hanging out at a friend's dorm (west campus, so co-ed by floor), and there she was going room to room and introducing herself.

Met another one because that same friend was friends with her, and she got a crush on me by seeing me in pictures, then he introduced us. But he also told us not to date, and to this day, dating her was a huge mistake. So don't do that. 

So, meet a lot of people. My freshman dorm had almost no one pledge, and we all just hung out all the time, and we met a lot of people through proximity. After freshman year, it gets a bit more difficult, so you just need to work even more at meeting as many people as possible, and it doesn't have to be at a party or frat or whatever.",positive,0.3071,positive,0.2,11/13/2019

Are you interested in someone (or is anyone interested in you)? If so, take initiative to ask them out. This could be like a coffee date, group outing with friends, or even just trying to hold longer conversations. If there‚Äôs something there, you can nurture it. If they‚Äôre not interested (or they don‚Äôt reciprocate), then you stop. 

If there‚Äôs not anyone in particular. Try to talk to more people in your clubs and large classes. You could also try a dating app (Tinder, Bumble, etc.). Stay patient. Sounds cliche, but you never know when it will happen. Good luck.",positive,0.9568,positive,0.23515873015873012,11/13/2019

comments,"I think it depends on the department. Some departments will give nothing, some will give a partial waiver, and others will give a complete waiver and even a stipend. Generally the engineering and computer science departments do the latter, since they have money to do this, and your research also brings in actual money (so they're still getting a great deal by waiving your tuition), whereas departments which generate less money (such as business and architecture) do the former because they don't have much to give and the research probably doesn't translate to profit. At least that is how it was a few years ago when I was a student. 

If I were you, I would speak to your academic adviser or someone in your department about RA salaries because it really depends on the department. 

Also note that the payment process may not be automatic; in my case the AE department used provide documentation for me to give to the bursar office indicating that tuition is to be waived and I would have to physically deliver that to the bursar at the start of the semester. After that when I'd log into oscar (or whatever software you guys use today) to make the payment, the tuition would be zero. The stipend on the other hand used to be direct deposit to bank account if I remember correctly.

If you are doing an MS, and your dept waives tuition for RA's, definitely do it. Avoid the student loans :)",positive,0.8553,positive,0.055701754385964926,11/13/2019

comments,"Here it is in 7 easy steps:

1. Don‚Äôt be involved in greek life

2. Meet people. Say hi to classmates. Go to a club meeting. Nerd out with someone over how Fallout 76 is the best game ever made. Accidentally crash your unicycle after getting plastered and trying to catch a donut that you dropped while riding, and be conversational with the people who poke you with a stick to see if you‚Äôre dead. To each their own, and do whatever way you want, but you gotta meet at least a good group of people you‚Äôll stick with.

3. Grow your relationships with the people that you‚Äôve meet and especially the ones you like. Keep talking to them in class and maybe hangout, or study in the culc. Keep going to that club meeting and go to that dinner/hangout that you‚Äôre instigating if nobody else in the club does. Dunk multiplayer in the greatest game of all time with your new buddy. Teach the stick people how to ride unicycles (being sober recommended but not necessary). 

4. Of the people you now have in your life, see if [potential romantic interest] is interested in having a better relationship with you. If it doesn‚Äôt work out, no big deal, there are a lot of fish in the sea. Keep going. 

5. Relationship is developed enough? Alright, get over that massive, crushing anxiety that makes you want to die and ask [romantic interest] if they‚Äôd like to pursue something more with you. 

6. They said yes? Congrats! They aren‚Äôt sure? Ok, give them time since people need different things to get into relationships, but don‚Äôt expect a yes. Got rejected? Ok, you tried and hopefully had fun and learned a bit along the way. Keep going.

7. Keep living life my dude, and don‚Äôt give up hope, whether you‚Äôre teaming up or soloing some sweet sweet Fallout 76. Or unicycling. Or both, I‚Äôm not your [parental guardian figure]. And remember to enjoy the ride

The biggest thing for me and for many people was getting over 5. It is hard to ask someone out sometimes. You can also try a more casual dating experience where you try to develop a relationship with someone through dates, but don‚Äôt be vague with what kind of relationship you want

Also lemme tell you dating does not require finesse lol. Idk what you‚Äôre not doing but the lack of a girlfriend doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre doing it wrong. Unless you‚Äôre being an obsessive creep. That is wrong. In case you have trouble telling where that line is, it‚Äôs roughly around where you cross into their personal space (like physically getting super close to them or being very suggestive) more than once when they‚Äôre not open to it. So don‚Äôt be a creep but be willing to not just be a wallflower. Good luck",positive,0.9952,positive,0.16525673400673396,11/13/2019

comments,"It does a couple of things. First, in instances like the unintentional sharing of academic data from last week, OIT can go in and directly remove the data from the mail server, ideally before anyone actually sees it. However, if it is automatically forwarded, then that data is saved on some other server that the administration can't access. 

From a more traditional cybersecurity perspective, it brings the responsibility of actual security more in-house. GT can implement all kinds of security measures, but if the GMail account you're forwarding to gets compromised, then it doesn't really matter.  This is especially important for employees, since they frequently are dealing with other students'/faculty's sensitive data as well as their own.

So it does help somewhat, and I doubt this is the only step they're taking, but it is definitely annoying and inconvenient for people who rely on the forwarding features.",positive,0.895,positive,0.12,11/14/2019

On their server, they can control things like MFA, minimum password requirements, response to legal demands for data, etc. They can also filter out a lot of the phishing traffic.

Not necessarily; that largely depends on how securely the user has their personal email locked down, but keep in mind most users see things like MFA and strong, ***unique*** passwords as an inconvenience, and the average reddit user is probably distinguishable in their security practices from the average GT email user.

comments,"This points to a school whose identity is in flux. Under Peterson we've tried to become world leaders by copying MIT, which has not sat well with many older grads or grads who have stayed in Georgia for a variety of reasons.  Peterson followed the money and went after grad students and researchers at the expense of a lot of the practical skills that used to be a point of pride for Tech grads. 

You laugh about grads being able to solder, but that's an example of a hands on skill that many current grads lack.

comments,"Hi! I‚Äôm a first year cellist with the Chamber Orchestra!
GT actually has two ensembles that strings can play in (both of which are full orchestras:) GT Chamber Orchestra and GT Symphony Orchestra  (typically called GTSO.) They are both audition ensembles, and auditions are held at the beginning of each semester, (although, second semester auditions are kinda hit or miss, because available spots depend on how many people stay enrolled in the ensembles.) Every audition, whether Chamber or GTSO, will consist of a major and minor scale, 3 octaves each, of your choice. Each audition will also have excerpts that you will be required to read (Chamber and GTSO have different sets of excerpts.) 
gtband.net has the audition excerpts from Fall19 auditions still up and available, so I would take a look at those and assess your skill level based on what you can realistically play. Both ensembles play professional, unarranged literature :)
As far as how difficult it is to get into the ensembles, I can‚Äôt say with any certainty. GTSO is definitely the more difficult ensemble, but once you are accepted into an ensemble, you are automatically eligible for it in following semesters, no reauditioning required! The only time you would have to audition again is if you wanted to try out for a higher ensemble.

It's easy to fit a motorcycle in a tight spot. Hard to get it out of. I back in park or drive through park everywhere because I am short and can't back out easily. Nobody likes carefully navigating a bike out by hand daily unless you own a shop.

Your 14 years of experience is useless out of context. My reasoning makes sense, you just don't want to listen. Your data set is fairly useless as it's one data set, for one specific person, over a long period. You haven't met every rider in the city, and you surround yourself with people like you. Which is why you see all of these things that fit your viewpoint. Most people get motorcycles because they like riding, not to impress women.

comments,"There's nothing wrong with giving opportunities to OOS students, but Tech needs to keep a balance. The guy in the article is definitely the type you say #okboomer to, but if certain Georgia residents think Tech doesn't enroll enough local students, I wouldn't 100% blame them for it.

&gt;If every state were to decrease out of state enrollment, there would be tens of thousands of talented students stuck in their big state college with few opportunities.

That's not really Tech's problem to fix. I can understand providing the opportunity to students who don't have it, but people are talking like Tech doesn't already admit a ton of OOS students. And the majority of those students are not from areas where there'a a lack of opportunity. Tech hovers at around 40% OOS. Out of the top 25 public colleges (USNews), only **8** have OOS percentages above 30%. Most public colleges don't enroll as many OOS students as Tech.

&gt;Private schools would continue to enroll based mostly on merit and little on residency, where public schools would be the opposite.

Not necessarily. Top public colleges are pretty damn hard to get into these days, just like private colleges. Even at Tech, it gets more competitive for in-state students each year. Is it as hard as OOS? I doubt it, but it's a public college. Enrolling students from your state doesn't mean they're skimping on ""merit"".

&gt;Georgia Tech, based in a state with little over 10 million people, would continue to have to compete with powerhouse private schools that pull interest and money from the entire nation

This hasn't stopped UNC, UCLA, UT Austin, UVA, UC Berkeley, UIUC, etc. from competing and all of those schools enroll fewer OOS students. Heck, it's *well known* that UNC has a hard quota on OOS students. UC Berkeley is usually &lt; 20% OOS, and they're every bit as strong as Tech in every field.

&gt;Our main priority shouldn't be staying true to the state, instead we need to be more focused on becoming the best school possible and serving the best students, all which benefit Georgia.

How do we do this within the context of being a public university and answering to the USG and taxpayers? Short of going private, there's no way around those two things. You're talking like staying true to the state and ""serving the best students"" are mutually exclusive.

Let's be clear. I 100% agree that practicing gratitude is one of the most positive, life-changing things you can do for your mental wellbeing. I don't agree that it helps 100% of the time in any mental state.

Sometimes that shit can backfire because you **already know you have it better than most**.

Gee, who the fuck am I to act like I know how to deal with Clinical Depression? It isn't like I have firsthand experience in overcoming it, or anything. Except that I do, and you are making a ridiculous amount of assumptions about me that have absolutely no basis in anything I've said.

&gt;you might actually do harm by telling this to people in real life

**Show me where I said that positive thinking should be the only approach to treating Depression. Show me exactly where I said it, and where you didn't just make an assumption out of thin air**. Everyone is different, and talk therapy is usually the best way to go; learning to reframe your mental-image is generally a huge part of that. So you can buzz off with telling me I can't help people by sharing my tips. 

I'm trying to share a little positive energy in a subreddit full of negativity and complaining, and here you are, whining about how I didn't specifically describe how to handle Clinical Depression. If you want to help people, help people. If you just want to armchair-quarterback folks who are trying to spread some kindness because it doesn't do **everything** you think it should, shut up and screw off, because you aren't helping anyone.

Hi! Thank you for your comment. I understand that this is not an ideal situation, but this is also not a serious research where I have to present data in black and white. I wasn't clear enough in my post.   


I don't need to extract the numbers. This is only something I want to check. I am only interested in seeing ""the interest"" and merely mention it in the presentation. We're presenting sketches, but as I am majoring in Interaction Design, I'd love to be able to back up my emotional and durable design with a quote as ""a majority would bring a bottle if they could"".   


I can see the up/down votes, and I think that should be enough. But, of course, I'll have to look into the ""adds random noise to the score""... If it's total horse shit I will make an anonymous survey.

comments,"So biggest thing to know about therapy is that for most people (though there are exceptions) it takes time to work. Just like in physical therapy, your brain doesn't get strong again in just one day. That's part of why we usually recommend to get started early rather than delaying until it's terrible.

Part of what that means is that it's better to do something in whatever area you're going to be in long-term. If you're coming back to Tech after break, you definitely want something in this area. Going to one appointment back home and then never seeing that therapist again likely will not help. The Counseling Center can maybe help you find a therapist, but they don't do therapy, just one-offs (which is part of why they're so useless).

Now, for me, therapy can actually be anything from exhausting to relaxing, depending on the stage of life and the day. What happens depends drastically - there are lots of different methods used by different practitioners for different people, as mental health is incredibly complex and there is no one-size-fits-all approach - so I can't really give you a good rundown of what to expect? Sometimes it looks like Hollywood Therapist ""tell me about your feelings,"" where they help you figure out what's going on in your head by getting you to talk it out. Sometimes they'll teach you about specific common mental distortions, then set homework on them to do every day and then analyze it and go over it when you come back in. Sometimes they'll teach you tools or tricks like specific breathing patterns, meditation, etc. Sometimes they'll get you talking and then start pointing out destructive thought patterns, then work on helping you learn to notice them. I've been in therapy for a number of years due to some pretty severe mental health issues, and all of those things are things I personally have had therapists do, and there's tons more.

In the meantime, the biggest things I can recommend are to take care of your physical health as much as possible. **Eat right, stay hydrated, sleep enough, get sunlight, get exercise** (and exercise can literally be something as small as a few jumping jacks or just walking to class instead of riding the trolley - *something*, no matter how small, is better than nothing). Those things help a ton. They don't fix it, but they take the edge off, and not doing things like eating, sleeping enough, or staying hydrated can make it *worse*.

I also recommend paying attention to your own thought patterns in the mean time. This is no substitute for actual medical care, but if you notice yourself talking down on yourself (can't do this, what's the point, never going to be good enough, gonna fail, useless, hopeless, worthless, etc), try to counteract that. In areas where your brain is trying to beat you down, think about your successes, or otherwise try to tell it why it's wrong.

If you can't think of any, that's fine - that doesn't mean there aren't any. It's a little hard to understand until you've seen it, but your brain is really good at hiding those things from you. For a common one, it's easy for people to say ""im useless no one will ever love me ill be alone forever see the proof is that I don't have a partner"" because their brain has just... stopped them from being able to see people who are hitting on them or crushing on them, or because their brain has sabotaged them to make a self-fulfilling prophecy.

And again this is NOT a substitute for actual medical advice - it's just stopgap suggestions to lessen the severity from someone who's dealt with this stuff a lot. Biggest stuff at this point is those same five things - **eat, sleep, hydrate, sun, exercise**.",positive,0.6483,neutral,-0.025303287981859417,11/18/2019

That being said, the record is going to put a massive damper on attendance.   I don't recall football games occupying much mindshare during my first few years when tech was winning 50% of their games....which is what one can probably expect for next year with this year's season being what it is.

North Ave isn‚Äôt too difficult to get into but you might have limited choices for which of the buildings and which floors because upper classmen get earlier time slots.

comments,"Hi up-white-gold,

Unfortunately at this time we are unable to provide any financial contribution to hired friends. This is due to a lack of funding from our primary corporate sponsors, namely our parents, and the diversion of most of our funding to sustain out-of-state kids paying tuition. Do not be alarmed; we do meet 100% of demonstrated emotional need and the occasional free meal swipe if necessary. If you have any special circumstances, feel free to reach out to us and we are sure non-monetary compensation methods can be reached such as, but not limited to, laughter. We hope this has answered your question.

You want to make a difference?  Call your senators.  Call your representatives.  Tell them that America being complicit with authoritarian regimes is unacceptable.  Tell them that if they refuse to take action, their job is over come next election.

By all means, talk to people about it as well, but please, for once, instead of just telling people what to be mad at tell them what the fuck they can do about it.  And take action yourself.  Why do republicans win so much when everyone seems against them?  Because younger and more liberal people prefer virtue signaling to actually taking any political action of substance.

comments,"Never sign a legal document without reading it in full. I know they often pressure you to quickly sign the lease right after they send you it, but you really should read it all first. All of your questions are answered by reading your lease.

From said lease:

&gt;Resident accepts financial responsibility for the full Term of the Agreement, regardless of whether the assigned
bedroom space is occupied for the duration of the full Term or at all.... **The Total Rent stated above is a fixed price for the entire Term and is payable in equal
installments for convenience; there is no proration or adjustment for any partial month of occupancy.**

From the section on termination:

&gt;Resident can terminate occupancy
by providing written notice to Owner and by fully vacating the premises, provided that in all cases **Resident will remain fully
responsible for the Total Rent that would have accrued under this Agreement, through the end of the full original Term**,
accelerated and payable at the time of termination. No exception can be made for financial hardship, academic changes, familymatters, medical issues, roommate conflict or any other reason....*[exception for if UH finds someone else to fill your lease, in which case they'll refund you the remaining rent after that person moves in]*

Continue reading the termination section and you'll see a section on what they call ""delegation."" They don't allow traditional subletting, but you can delegate to another person, which is basically subletting but done directly through UH (you remain responsible for rent if the delegate doesn't pay).",positive,0.846,positive,0.1315018315018315,11/19/2019

ECE 4180 also counts and it looks like I'll probably end up taking both CS 3651 and ECE 4180 so I can count one for my major and one for my minor. Note that If you want your CS 3630 (CS robotics class) to count for the minor you will have to take 2 classes to replace it as it counts for both your threads for your major. Planning classes with this combo is like a O(n\^3) problem but it's possible you just need the pre-reqs to get into ECE classes.

3D printed guns are no cure-all, but they are ideal for acquiring more advanced military hardware.

My other advice would be to step through the lecture code and make sure you actually understand why things are happening. For all the pointer material (which if I recall was the content of the final midterm), read documentation and experiment in a coding environment to conceptually understand the topic.

1, Study hard from now on;

3, Practice on the homework assignments, midterms, sample exams etc, and make sure when the numbers/conditions change, you still can get the correct answer (you will see some/a lot of similar questions in the final exam depending how nice your professor is)

4, Go to the professor's office hours as frequently as possible. Ask questions and figure out the things that confuse you. Also, many professors appreciate the hard work and good attitudes, and that might become a factor to boost your grade up when you are at the margin (unless the professor is completely an a\*\*hole);

comments,"Hi! I‚Äôm engineering and what I do is go over all the problems we do in class. I also make sure to give myself plenty of time to study. I tend to study in chunks. So if the material can be split into (let‚Äôs say 3) parts, I will give myself 4 days to study. I would study each individual section for a day and then spend the last day as a review day. I know sometimes this isn‚Äôt possible but mostly it is, you just gotta give yourself plenty of time. So to study, I like to rewrite the notes. You would be soooo surprised how much more you understand when you go through the notes again. Sometimes it‚Äôs literally magic. Then I do all the in class problems. Try to do it first without looking at the answers. If you can‚Äôt at first it‚Äôs okay!!! As long as you can by the end. I also redo the homework problems the same way.

comments,"Not enough karma to post this as a thread:  


The entire UC system has recently divested their $80 billion endowment from fossil fuels. This has led to much attention on the issue. Last month, an article appeared in MIT's newspaper about divestment. Currently there are activists in New York fasting (since  Monday) to push Columbia University to take action divesting from fossil fuel industries.

GT has an endowment of about $2 billion. Assuming that even a small percentage of  this is invested in stocks with top coal, oil and gas companies means  tens of millions of dollars invested (likely hundreds) are not helping  with the continued building of fossil fuel reserves (already up to +2700 gigatons). For reference, it is expected that the carbon budget for keeping below +2 degrees Celsius by 2050 is less than 600 gigatons. It is unlikely that companies will be willing to lose these reserves.

What  public data is available which shows what holdings GT puts its endowment in? Assuming that the holdings are comparable to usual  portfolios and that there is indeed a sizeable investment in fossil fuels, how supportive are students of this decision to put this money  there? Are there ongoing movements which call for divestment at GT?",positive,0.8152,neutral,0.043141945773524724,11/20/2019

There‚Äôs also not much community in home park aside from in your own house from what I‚Äôve seen.

If you have to go to like west campus or tech square and don‚Äôt like walking, nav would be a better option with buses and such. Location sidenote: nav is good if you watch football, glc is good if you watch basketball.

Other things. GLC has a mailroom so you get your mail delivered to your building instead of the student center which is convenient. Nav has better gym(not sure where i heard that tho) and a volleyball court.

comments,"It's not necessarily that simple. Lot of folks are struggling because of health issues that are incompatible with an educational system that assumes you are fully able to do 100% on demand. There are resources (ODS is a lifesaver), and most professors are pretty understanding, but that doesn't help when you don't know the stuff on the test because it was only covered in a class you couldn't go to due to health issues. Not does it help when there's simply not enough time in the day to do all your work without sacrificing sleep and you have a condition where sacrificing sleep can lead to terrible health issues. People often have more going on than you can see on the surface.

Other issue I found in my time as a tutor is that standard tutoring practices heavily favor people who are already doing well. Requiring someone to come in with a question depends on them knowing what's wrong, but if you're really behind then not knowing what's wrong is  the whole problem in the first place. There's a lot of systems like that where there are resources that only work if you're keeping up or ahead. Having been on both extremes (4.0 and working my butt off to do everything and acing it all vs struggling because sick), this stuff means it's very easy for one bad thing to cascade.

That's also where a lot of mental health issues happen - you, who've always done well and used the resources available to you, miss a few classes and get behind on the reading (because, idk, a parent died or w/e - in real life, stuff happens). Suddenly, you don't know what the class is talking about. You're completely lost, and a lot of times folks feel embarrassed to ask for help or just can't acknowledge to themselves what's going on. After all, a lot of times when this happens, we're talking barely-adults who don't really have any experience with either struggling with anything or with self-advocacy + living on their own. Suddenly you feel helpless, and you don't know why. You just can't keep up, can't catch up, can't understand - and that leads to feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, despair, etc, especially if you're at a selective school like Tech where most people who can get in have ""really good at school"" as part of their identity. This stuff can quickly become full-blown depression if not treated. And, hey, the counselling center is utterly inaccessible and has months-long waiting lists, sends people to (extremely expensive) private mental hospitals at the drop of a hat, and doesn't actually do therapy at all.

*This is how people die here.* Inexperienced kids hitting hardship for the first time while also entering a place that is utterly unforgiving of that. Tech is full of systems that only work for people who are already doing well, with a culture that both quietly shames not doing well enough because ""they must not be working hard"" and actively promotes terrible study habits. Folks bragging about ""I stayed up all night last night studying!"" ""well *I* pulled two all-nighters in a row!"" or w/e is terribly toxic. Cause yeah, this isn't all about systems. There's a student body culture problem we don't seem to want to acknowledge. But *also*, the systems are geared towards people doing well.",negative,-0.9957,neutral,-0.028047619047619047,11/22/2019

Sports are fun when the team wins. If there's no chance of recovery, it's usually not worth staying. This is true for all sporting events.

I want our team to win. I want to have a reason to be excited when Georgia Tech football comes on. But with our record now? The only game worth going to is the UGA one, and that's purely for the rivalry. Most people only have 4 years here, and every minute has to count.

Imagine growing up during the Recession, when you were juuust old enough to know what was going on. Doing active shooter drills, never knowing what flying was like before 9/11, etc. That's how most current college students grew up - in an incredibly paranoid society on the frontier of instant communication. There's also a bunch of other stuff I typed out and then decided no one wanted to reach that much, but suffice it to say mental health issues are dramatically higher because, in part, kids don't have as much time to just... be kids. Not everyone's experiences are the same.

Also, I guarantee you a lot of this stuff was going on around you anyways. Not as much, but one of the big differences is that now we're just more *aware* of it.

The short term result might be that you get a one click better grade...but.

* it actually huts other classmates who didn't feel comfortable asking for a higher grade but had a similar score to you...warping the discussion around GPA

* it reinforces the attitude around here of grade based competition and grade based focus versus a more authentic approach to learning

comments,"I have nothing but positive things to say. I looked around before resigning my lease and there is honestly not a better option for student themed apartments for Georgia Tech. Especially if your classes are mostly on this side of campus like for IE's. I get an actual walk-in closet and a full-size washer and dryer(not stacked combo's like at the other places). If you look at the square footage you are getting more at Theory's floorplans than the others. The Standards bedrooms were tiny in comparison to Theory's. The fact that they didn't put in a massive pool deck like the Standard keeps the non-resident Frat boys out of the place and reduces the noise level I think.

My only complaint would be that the first couple of months it seemed a lot of my packages got lost because the new apartment street address was not in the mailing system or something yet. I decided to resign because it really is the best bang for your buck for a GT student.

comments,"I've been living here since August and I gotta say, it's a really nice appartment. Each living room comes with a 60ish inch (idk exactly) 4K TV which is great to not have to bring one in yourself. The furniture is also pretty modern/clean which is a plus. I currently live in a 4bed/4bath, and the room sizes are definitely a lot bigger than you would get on campus. The closet space is def bigger than what'd u get at SQ5 and I'd say the bathroom is a bit bigger too. And for $990/month (prices may have gone up since?) it's def worth.

The only complaint I really have with the place is completely subjective - I don't like the location that much. It comes in handy cuz my first class is in the IC (7 min walk) but for personal reasons I'd just rather be on east, bc of friends and stuff. Also next year I won't have classes on west so it'd be annoying to walk so far everyday to get places. Another thing about the location is that there aren't that many restaurants in short walking distance besides wingnuts, a bbq place, and a cafe (which I rarely eat there bc it's so expensive). But I think they're trying to expand retail space in the area so it could be less of an issue in the future.

Final Instructional Class Days

Final Instructional Class Days are scheduled during each regular term including the Full Summer Session and are the last two instructional days of the term immediately preceding the first reading period.

No tests or quizzes are to be administered on these days. Lab quizzes and/or practicums may be given in courses comprised of both a lecture and a scheduled lab, wherein the lecture carries at least two credits.

For all courses, graded homework or assignments, lab reports, course projects, demonstrations, studio reviews, and presentations may be due during these two days, provided that they are listed on the syllabus at the start of the semester.

All quizzes and tests should be graded and reported to students on or before the last Final Instructional Class Day.",positive,0.0772,neutral,0.017499999999999998,11/25/2019

comments,"I can understand that your mind isn‚Äôt in the best place right now, and that‚Äôs okay. Everyone that commented above (and even those here that haven‚Äôt) are simply trying to let you see that you *can* do it and believe in you. Tech believes in you too, hence why the accepted you.

Now, I agree that maybe college isn‚Äôt for everyone. Is that true for you? What do you intend to do if you were to drop out right now? Do you have another passion? I ask these because these are all things i asked myself (and still do) whenever I get in a bad place and also contemplate dropping out bc quite frankly, I too feel constantly lonely and anxious here. Ultimately, I don‚Äôt have an answer to those questions and I stay. Most people are right, in the grand scheme, these 4-5 years are minimal in the span of your life and offer a greater security for the future. Second, if you don‚Äôt have a passion, it‚Äôs probably the best place to find it (and if somehow from there you decide college gets in the way of that passion, by all means, safely drop out if it‚Äôll make you happy). Until then, I strongly suggest to give it a try. As cliche as it is, quoting Steve Jobs from a commencement he gave, a lot of stuff won‚Äôt make sense now thinking forward, but it will all make crystal clear sense looking backwards in the future: you really do have to have a little faith that somehow those dots in your life that might not make sense now will all connect in the future.

It‚Äôs rough. Especially now with finals around the corner. Just know that we all believe in you, grades are by no means the best judgment of everything you know, and nobody thinks of your intelligence any less for how you perform on these exams (and if they do, they can go fuck themselves). You got this buddy. If you ever, or anyone for that matter, ever wants to talk‚Äîin text or in person‚Äîby all means please please do reach out (I am socially awkward/anxious too tho so heads up).

One year, when the GT Band was rehearsing at uGA, the band went to the pregame interlocking GT set (formation), and every musician dropped fast-growing grass seeds where they were standing. After a few weeks or so, the new grass had outgrown the original grass and made a very obvious GT logo. uGA first attempted mowing the grass away but eventually had to replace the entire field.

The next year, uGA bandmembers brought grass seed to GT's campus in retribution. They got to the dwagiest set they had, dropped the seed, and proudly let GT know what they had done in retribution.

Fortunately, being an artificial turf field, nothing grew, but that didn't occur to the peons in Athens.

comments,"Why is this being downvoted?  It's a fair question.

You're ""allowed"" to reneg at least in the sense that you won't get kicked out of school or anything.  But basically, once you say yes to an offer it should actually mean yes, or C2D2 will get pissed and might refuse to work with you to get permanent employment, which might be a bad thing.  So this really might not be a good idea unless the new company is among your dream companies, the role relates directly to what you want to be doing, and you think there's a high probability of getting a permanent offer from them.

The reasoning for this policy is that it's sometimes tough for companies once they've allocated funding to fill that position with a quality candidate sometimes, and then if GT gets a rep for having students that hang companies out to dry those companies will offer GT students fewer internships.  This not only hurts GT but future GT students too.

It's all kind of moot until you actually get that other offer though.  It might be worth interviewing and then you can make a decision then.

On the plus side, it's only Thanksgiving and if you were to reach out the them early and explain you got an unexpected offer that you think you're an even better fit for they might understand, and they might be grateful for a chance to extend an offer instead to another candidate who might be more likely to take a permanent position there.  Or they might be pissed that they have to start interviewing again for a slot they thought they already had filled after all the good candidates have committed elsewhere, because that costs them time and money too.

Whatever you do, just don't start thinking you might goad these companies into a bidding war.  That would just piss off **EVERYONE** and you'll end up with no internship and no help from GT getting permanent employment either.

Edit: I knew a grad student who tried the bidding war thing when something like this happened.  It didn't go well, and that's only why I mentioned it.  It might work for experienced hires in hard-to-fill positions but that's about it, and it's a terrible idea for interns and new grads.",positive,0.6174,positive,0.12132239057239057,11/29/2019

This system is like me getting a job through LinkedIn but having to clear rescinding it for a better offer through LinkedIn",positive,0.9239,positive,0.23733766233766235,11/29/2019

comments,"It‚Äôs tough to expect some students to stand up to exploding offers without a school backing them. If you finally got your first offer and they give you a day to accept, you will likely accept out of concern of not having any job, even if others may be coming. Recruiters know this and know that students are poor at navigating these situations, which is why exploding offers exist in the first place.

It‚Äôs definitely a lot different from the LinkedIn example. You don‚Äôt have to clear it with the school to renege, you just can‚Äôt participate in their fair anymore if you do. Just like how you might lose a connection with a third party recruiting organization if you renege on an a company they have a relationship with. 

I forget the specific school, but one of the University of California system schools had a few big tech companies not show up for a few years due to the students‚Äô reputation for reneging on offers. 

In the end, Georgia Tech has to balance its protection of students and the interests of the companies with which they have relationships with. I think the rules are entirely appropriate and well reasoned.",positive,0.8558,neutral,0.03930555555555555,11/29/2019

1) the elevators in my building break one or twice a week. Really annoying if you're trying to bring something up to the 6th floor.

2) there's been a few doors (the ones closest to the BBQ restaurant) that just don't work anymore. Someone ripped the door handle off in early September and they haven't fixed it yet. I've gone in to the leasing office multiple times to ask them to fix it and they say they're working on it.

3) the trash chute on my floor keeps going down. The trash chute door stops opening, and everyone just starts putting their trash bags on the floor of the trash chute room. Pretty gross.

4) the rooms are big, but they aren't as big as, say, arium (down the street), and we're paying a premium to live here.

5) the package system was really bad at the beginning. There was a day where they booted everyone out of the system, so we had to sign back up again to start receiving packages. They never sent out an email saying this happened, so lots of people were losing packages.

Overall, the place is physically nice and clean, and there isn't the classic Atlanta pot-smell in every hallway, but there's quite a bit that's worse than on campus dorms and I'd hate to see that go unmentioned.",negative,-0.9396,negative,-0.06062710437710437,11/29/2019

comments,"So I'm a relatively short guy. I'm 5'4"". Does it bother me...not really, but I get alot of comments from people either joking or just straight up being pricks sometimes. 

I also happen to be a Martial arts instructor and usually teach classes for children, teens, and occasionally adults. I really love teaching the ""Little Tigers"" (ages 4-6) and the white/yellow belts (lower belts). I really love working with them because they try really hard and when they get the lightbulb moment, it's great. Their faces light up and they practice it a hundred times until it's perfect. 

My favorite memory of this comes from when I first started and my first group of white belts came through. It's been approximately 4 years since I started working with my dojo and these white belts have worked up the belt ranks now to were many of them are testing for their Junior Black Belts. 

One of the best compliments I ever received was from the second black belt test for this group in which the majority of them tested. At the very end, all of my students graduated. They all came up and dog-piled me. It was the best feeling. I started tearing up. The parents all came up to me, many of whom I consider my family. They said thank you and such but these kids looked up to me and said thank you and shared so much sweat and tears and years of hard work with me. 

Yet, the best compliment I have ever received is this: a student named E, a super hardworking student always trying her best and never leaving class without a smile, came up to me and said that I was tall. Her reasoning was that it was too hard for her to do head kicks. It made me laugh and smile so hard. I challenged her that she should stretch and try again and when she could get a head kick in then I would teach a class that would focus on something she was interested in. (Ex. If she wanted to do jumping kicks, I would dedicate ~15 minutes to jumping kicks). Well, a year later, E was ~6inches taller, and finally knocked me. She came back and said ""I finally did it but now my next goal is to be as good as you."" It made me cry that day. 

Finally, the last one that hit me emotionally the most was the day I left my studio for Tech. I had worked there for 2 years and 328 days (I counted because that's how much this job and all my students meant to me, and I cherish every single one of those days). For the week leading up to it, my boss hid this entire operation from me. He asked that each student make a card for me if they wanted to, if the parents wanted to make one they could, asked each student to sign a poster if they wanted to, etc. I left my final day of work at 9pm when we closed. My dojo is in this small strip mall and I have this habit of everytime I close up, I grab food from a supermarket store on the same strip. Well, I walked into the store after locking up, and there was my students and their families. It was my family. They were waiting for me there because they knew I'd be there. My boss handed me a poster filled with 100+ signatures of students and a sack of cards. Like, a  Santa sized sack of cards. 

I cried for weeks and I miss my students/my families and friends that I made from that job everyday. That was the pinnacle compliment I ever received: being told that I was truly loved by the friends and family I had made along the way. Not the family I was born with, but the families that truly cherished me. Hundreds of kids that all look at me as their mentor and I look at them as my kids (and I truly feel that way, once they were on that mat, they were mine. I took care of them and I made sure that they were having fun and we're good both on and off that mat). The parents of those kids treated me like a son and I felt accepted. That's the best compliment I received. 

I could go all day telling each and every redditor on this feed about my experiences at my studio. Thank you for allowing me to tell this story. This Thanksgiving I went back to blood family for the first time in a while and I really needed this question to smile again.",positive,0.9994,positive,0.2068754313319531,11/30/2019

I realize we will never come close to having the kind of athletes that they do on such a large scale. I never wanted to get rid of Paul Johnson because no matter the complaints people had about him I never felt there was a game we couldn‚Äôt win. I was embarrassed this year. The only good thing I can say is that I heard more about recruiting in two weeks of the new coach than 2 yrs with Paul Johnson but that could have just as easily been solved by hiring a guy like the new coach to do nothing but recruiting. I gave up my season tickets at the beginning of this year because the turnout by tech fans and students was atrocious. I had season tickets for over 20 years but I honestly was so thankful I didn‚Äôt have to be in that stadium today sitting next to some drunk, loud  piece of shit Ga. fan. It was embarrassing seeing other teams fans fill our stadium. I wish tech people would just burn their fucking tickets instead of selling them. For fucksakes most people who went to tech or graduated from there don‚Äôt need the goddamn money. Cheap bastards.

David Patenaude can suck the fattest dick you can find though. Our offensive performance and playcalling has been horrific all year long and it's pathetic. A good OC can take what they've been given and craft an identity for the team. But we've had zero identity and zero success on offense and that's horseshit. I want to make Brent Key the OC and bring in the QB coach from Louisville or something. Patenaude's lack of ability could ruin this turn around and I have no patience for it. If we're gonna swing for the fences, we have to be building something fundamentally strong. Our OC is fundamentally weak.

A) The Cancer Treatment Centers of America are a very sketchy set of private medical organizations which cherry-pick their patients to appear highly effective (see https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cancer-ctca/special-report-behind-a-cancer-treatment-firms-rosy-survival-claims-idUSBRE9250L820130306). Also, its a bit worrisome that this post immediately talks about comparing treating the stress of GT students similar to the stress of cancer patients.... Either we are downplaying the stress of cancer patients, or we are saying that GT academics are similar to cancer.

B) humor.gatech.edu doesn't lead to anything as of this comment.

C) Pretending that mental health can be directly ""attacked"" with humor seems a bit pretentious, as though this is guaranteed to reduce stress. Perhaps, better wording could have been, ""provide perspectives on""?",negative,-0.9831,neutral,0.030769230769230764,11/30/2019
