comments,"1. They are definitely not required to graduate, however I will say they are 100% in your best interest to do. They give you something to do during the summer, you make some good money, they boost your resume, and you get to meet new people in a (potentially) new city!

2. This depends on your major. I‚Äôm in CS, and the logic is you WILL get something, just maybe not the thing you want. I will say though, be careful not to run headlong into the competitive ‚Äúwho has the better internship‚Äù mindset. This will only exhaust you, because there will always be somebody who has one better. Take the best you can get and enjoy your time!",positive,0.9829,positive,0.37244318181818176,05/31/2019
comments,"1) Not a requirement, but it definitely helps for getting jobs after graduation and such, so you should actively seek them. It also gives you real world experience in the field you‚Äôre pursuing so you can see and decide whether or not you actually like the career you‚Äôve been aiming for. 

2) It honestly all depends on you. I wouldn‚Äôt say being at Tech makes it harder/more competitive to land an internship. If anything, I‚Äôd say the name of the school looks good but it‚Äôs definitely not everything. The best thing you can do is focus on developing your skills in whatever field you‚Äôre trying to get into, work on some projects in and out of class, and keep seeking these jobs/internships despite rejection. Not everyone here is applying to the same jobs you are.

Speaking as someone who works in ML, these positions are very, very competitive and it's not uncommon to be competing with PhDs for similar research engineering positions. Just taking classes might give you a foundation, but it may not give you enough practical experience with applying those concepts to something (a large-scale project, or publication, etc) that actually demonstrates ML competency.

It's like trying to go for SWE positions after only taking CS classes. Can it work? Sure, but it'll be very hard (especially for top companies). Internships, personal projects, etc are what get new grads through the door in that field.

All were primarily technical (though any good technical interview also has elements of a behavioral interview). For full time the recruiter contacted me near the end of my summer internship (at another company) and let me skip to onsite.

As far as I know Jane Street doesn't come to Tech's career fair, but that's just because they're small and don't really hire a large number of people, so they favor career fairs that are closer to them (they're in New York). If you want to work at any selective-ish company, you just need to pay attention in the classes that cover the stuff that's going to be asked in the interviews - more selective companies tend to ask trickier questions, but nothing harder than what you would have seen in an upper level class. Another one of my friends also got an internship offer from them, and I've heard of other tech students interviewing with them and two sigma as well. No company has any reason to look down on Tech students - you're in an incredibly advantageous position when it comes to finding jobs, so it's good to have a positive outlook.",positive,0.974,positive,0.2213031677317392,06/02/2019

comments,"Hey there! Fairly recent BSBA-ITM grad here. This is a little wordier than I intended, but hopefully you'll get some use out of it.

One of the more important things to note is that your degree isn't in ITM, it's Business Administration with a concentration in ITM. That means you'll still get the [usual smattering of traditional business courses](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/degree-programs/undergraduate/files/Student%20Credit%20Sheet%20Template%203.13.18.pdf) (Finance, Marketing, Law, Operations, HR, etc) for the first two years, then your last two years focus much more on your concentration.

Once you get into the ITM courses, you have some leeway with different classes to determine how technical you want to be. You can do a more technical path with databases, programming, and networking, or you can be somewhat less technical with project management, analytics, and technology policy (just examples). Another option to get more technical experience is to take some CS courses for your free electives - some of which could count towards the ITM concentration. You won't, for example, learn how to implement your own network routing protocol in 4053 (Bus. Data Communications) like you would in CS 3251 (Computer Networks) but you will get a good intro to how networks work (both within a business and the internet as a whole) and how they can impact a business.

There's a full list of the options for ITM courses on [Scheller's website](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/degree-programs/undergraduate/courses-curriculum/curriculum-itm.html). Some of my favorites in ITM specifically were 4052 (Systems Analysis &amp; Design) and 3743 (Emerging Technologies). Those two, along with 4450 (Project Management) have been extremely useful at work. There used to be a website [icc.gatech.edu](http://icc.gatech.edu) that had syllabi for every course offered on campus, but it appears to be down for the moment. If there are any courses in particular that you're interested in seeing syllabi for, feel free to comment back and I'll see if I have them from when I was around.

As for your jobs question, ITM folks end up in many different categories. I'm doing network and systems architecture now, but many of my classmates went into consulting, systems analysis, and healthcare IT. Many large firms including the [Big Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms) recruit ITM folks for all kinds of jobs.

I'm sure some other folks will comment with their experience as well, but I'm very happy with the ITM program and where I ended up. Happy to answer any questions you have. Also, [Dr. Mike Smith](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/directory/faculty/smith.m/index.html) who (as far as I know still) leads the ITM concentration is a super friendly guy who I'm sure would be happy to chat.",positive,0.9972,positive,0.261734034699151,06/03/2019

Your social circle is just as important for survival as food. You probably don't see the importance of maintaining great relationships because you are a tech student... you have been grinding, burying yourself in books, and most importantly, stressing. You have been prioritizing on your self-fulfilling goals rather than fulfilling your need of genuine human connection. 

Think about the moments that make you the happiest. Was it when you were watching interesting YouTube videos? Or maybe it was when you ate some crispy fried chicken tenders dipped in BBQ sauce? In these activities, you consume to acquire short term satisfaction. Let me tell you the moments you remember the most: your childhood memories... the bonding between classmates when studying for a final...and the erotic feeling of the presence of your crush. Establishing a meaningful connection with somebody by just liking them, and maintaining that connection will give you such a tremendous energy boost. True friends allow you to be open about yourself, give honest advice in what direction you should go in life, help provide meaning to your life, discuss your problems, and cheer you on to give you faith and self-confidence in yourself.

If you still feel tired after acquiring a well-established  relationship, then it is because of biological reasons. Sleep, smart eating habits and exercise will do a world of wonders.",positive,0.9908,positive,0.2392857142857142,06/04/2019
comments,"West campus isn't actually that dead, and being where it's quieter and less dangerous is a plus. The only downside that I've noticed is that the food there sucks compared to the food on east (and willage is only open until 10 while nave is open until 1). However, they're completely changing the dining services, which I think will make willage a lot nicer. Also, I do really like being closer to the crc. It would be about a 45 minute walk to get to the crc and back if you live in east, and I don't know about you, but if I had to walk that far, I'd never be motivated enough to exercise. Altogether, I'd definitely look into living somewhere on west instead. Generally, the west campus dorms are nicer. I lived in folk cause I was part of the llc explore, and it was alright.

Tbh after your 4 years it wont really matter what name is on your degree. (Some recruiters don't really know the difference between CmpE and CS). If you are aiming for hardware research and grad school, I would say ECE. If you are aiming to get into the industry right after college, CS is better.

EE + CS minor - Pretty common to hear about, people doing it tend to have the opinion that it's better than CompE if you want to get into robotics and similar things.

CS with a devices thread - Also common to hear about, a lot of CS majors who like engineering and robotics do this.

CS + robotics minor - What I'm currently looking into, because some upperclassmen mentioned that if they could do it over, they would do a robotics minor instead of the devices thread because they prefer the EE classes for that stuff

CompE - Some people are pretty happy with it, many end up switching to CS. It seems more of the move if you're really into circuits and processor design.

It might be good to try an introductory EE class early on, I kind of wish I took one last year.

I had my parent as a co-signer, but I checked on the website and it‚Äôs not required. The only thing is that the interest is steep imo, (11-12%) but that‚Äôs probably the market rate anyway.

comments,"I do see it as an economic advantage. The interest starts accumulating right away. So, if you take out 10k for the year in August, you are paying 6 months of extra interest for money you won‚Äôt be using until spring. And, the way the loan works is that they send the money to Georgia tech, and then Georgia tech refunds you the excess to your bank account  (that‚Äôs how I get the extra spending money). It‚Äôs not applied towards your future balance of spring semester-it‚Äôs just sitting in your bank account and you‚Äôre paying interest for it! 

To answer your other question, I‚Äôm a huge procrastinator and almost always forget to apply for the loan until like a month before and have been fine. They‚Äôre super quick about disbursement.

comments,"Hey,

That‚Äôs most likely one of our K9 Officers or one of our Crime Suppression Officers.  Almost all of our Police Officers carry and have access to a long gun (rifle).  It‚Äôs a piece of life saving equipment in the face of immense danger.  That Officer was loading his gear into his vehicle from the lockers.  You will see this from time to time.  

I assure you, it‚Äôs fortunate that we have access to equipment like this as it can save someone‚Äôs life when a person wishes us, or you, harm. 

The green uniforms are common place in law enforcement.  Almost all of the K9 Units in the metro Atlanta area wear these kind of uniforms.  The handlers are working with dogs 24/7 and getting into some not so clean areas. The hair from the dogs doesn‚Äôt show as much as if they were wearing a black or blue uniform. 

Our Crime Suppression Officers also wear green uniforms.  It‚Äôs common place for specialized units to wear a different and highly functional uniform such as this.  

I promise, it‚Äôs nothing to be alarmed about.  We aren‚Äôt doing this because of the military.  We are doing it because it‚Äôs a functional and high performance price of equipment and clothing.  There are other campus and municipal / county agencies doing the same thing. 

Regardless of the equipment we carry or the uniforms we wear, we are still here for YOU.  

I encourage you to message me and come by the PD and we can show you all this and explain it in detail.

Thanks so much for the conversation.

Less extreme would be to call or go to stamps psychiatry and explain the issue. This is only appropriate if the person is not an immediate threat to themselves. A psychiatrist/stamps psychiatry as a whole can petition the court to order mandatory (involuntary) outpatient treatment.

I don't make a full time job out of peer reviewing economic papers though so that is just the example I had handy.  Do you think it is reasonable to ignore current spending on something when analyzing the cost of sourcing that something from somewhere else?  It's disingenuous.  I don't care if it is pricing widgets or healthcare.

2. Science sort of is a consensus effort though. That's how peer review and replication work. You yourself seemed to reference scientific consensus earlier in this thread by bringing up anti-vaxers, climate change, etc.

3. As far as your speculation about the best economists starting businesses and leaving academia, now I'm the one who is going to need a source on that.  You also seem to be implicitly assuming that the majority of ""the best"" economists, although a minority of all economists, are radical libertarians.  That seems dubious.

The mental gymnastics must be exhausting over there.  Either way, I'm done debating this.  At a minimum allowing this type of apparent influence looks bad, and in my opinion should disqualify this guy from being president of a research institute as prestigious as Tech.

Initially, they were limited to only interviewing a few individuals, however, this was later relaxed to allow for far more interviews to take place.

So there was an investigation into him as a candidate, not just the sexual assault claims, and the findings were not published. The FBI was doing directed research, not looking to charge someone. Sexual assault is almost always outside of their jurisdiction and even if they had made a call on its truth, we didn‚Äôt see the results and they would not have the power to charge him. 

&gt;	After a week of interviewing people whom the FBI deemed important to their determination, they came out with no additional findings. Senators were given access to the report, and as you have seen, no additional information was found to substantiate the accusations.


No additional information was found for or against the findings to the general public because that report was never published.

Salary. Not insane compared to some, but GMU isn't an ""elite"" institution. While our CS and IT degrees are very well known and respected in the DC/DMV area, we're still I'd say just slightly above average in terms if prestige.

Koch Brothers donations. While many take issue with where the money comes from, many also have issues with how it's spent. Because of GMU's location, the vast majority of the school lives off campus and commutes. Parking is something that could certainly have more money sent its way.

Tuition was raised a few times within a short period of time. I think back to back once or twice even.

There have been several sexual assault/harassment issues lately. This has anything to do with Cabrera, but it does make people like him less since he's the sitting president. I think it largely just has to do with the sheer volume of students. Also I swear people in general are hella weird in 2019.

Oh and Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh was hired to speak at the GMU Antonin Scalia Law School this summer (speak in the UK mind you). People are obviously upset about that, but again imo a silly thing to be upset out. It's great to have a SC justice speak regardless of those matters and opinions on him as a person. So people are upset at his (brief) hiring.

I'd say that's the gist of it. He's been president for I think 6ish years? Overall I wouldn't say he's a bad president. GMU certainly has grown the last few years and definitely for the better. I think he just leaves a bad taste in people's mouths.

Hopefully someone else will pop over and add some more insight.

The frequency of rape allegations seems to have more to do with the increased enrollment at GMU than anything else, so while I‚Äôm not going to completely ignore this, I think it can be boiled down to ‚Äúcorrelation does not necessarily imply causation‚Äù

Increased enrollment worries me a little bit, especially if he‚Äôs going to lobby the state legislature for more funding in exchange for more in-state seats.

GMU needed a president that would help them grow and become a strong research university, which Cabrera seems to have done well. For Tech on the other hand, our biggest strength is that we're already a nationally renowned research and engineering university with an abundance of corporate connections. What we need (or at least what many students want) is a president that will address our weaknesses: the mental health crisis where 1/3 of the student body have struggled with severe mental health issues, educational issues where many professors are apathetic towards teaching and do a poor job of it and/or assign ludicrous workloads, quality of life issues like our awful food, etc. We want someone who actually listens to student needs and concerns rather than just chasing dollar signs and big corporations, and that's exactly what Cabrera isn't.

The other issue too is that, regardless of what you think about the Koch money and Kavanaugh stuff, some of Cabrera's actions have been questionable or at least controversial and political.

""Two years ago, on March 31, 2016, George Mason University announced that as a result of a $20 million donation from an anonymous donor and $10 million donation from the Charles Koch Foundation, it was changing the name of the Law School to the Antonin Scalia Law School. This generated intense controversy about renaming a publicly-funded state law school after one of the most ideological and polarizing Supreme Court Justice in history. Accompanying that controversy were concerns about inappropriate influence by an anonymous donor and the Charles Koch brothers who have long exerted control over George Mason and its affiliated Mercatus Center and Institute for Human Studies. Less known outside of legal circles is that Justice Scalia was the founding faculty advisor to the Federalist Society in 1982 and its highest-profile member and frequent speaker for the next 34 years, with four speeches at Federalist Society events in 2015 alone.""

comments,"Thank you for posting these!

Here's what I take away from these two articles. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

- Between 1990 and 2011, some GMU donors had influence on the hiring of professors.

- Specifically until 2009, the Koch brothers were among these donors and had a role in choosing candidates for faculty positions.

- Cabrera took office in 2012.

- In 2016, Federalist Society officials involved in discussion about the hiring of new faculty members and recommended a student. The Dean of the law school said that ‚Äúdecisions on faculty hiring and student admissions and scholarships are independent and strictly the purview of the law school‚Äôs faculty and administrative leadership.‚Äù

- In 2018, he announced that he was made aware of this donor influence stuff and started an investigation. The University has made changes to make sure this sort of thing doesn't happen again.


My take: The Koch brothers using donations to pick faculty members looks like a thing that happened that shouldn't have happened. However, there's nothing in these articles that suggests Cabrera is at all related to that, since those agreements stopped a few years before he took office. If we are to believe the dean of the law school, the Federalist Society did not exert undue influence into the hiring process either. Even if we don't believe him, the Federalist Society allegations are an order of magnitude less bad than the Koch ones.

I'm by no means happy about this finalist. We needed someone who can make a meaningful change to campus culture and cares about student mental health, and the Board of Regents' press release shows that that wasn't remotely a priority. (Then again, we knew they wouldn't be a priority as soon as we saw who was on the search committee.)

There are reasons to not be happy with this decision, but ""pay-for-play from the Koch brothers"" is not one of them.",positive,0.8266,positive,0.10797979797979801,06/07/2019

And lastly, Cabrera (and GMU in general) is unwilling to disclose the full scope of what conditions came with Koch donations during his presidency (citing that they're protecting the 'anonymity' of their donors).

The Scalia Law School controversy is definitely an order of magnitude less terrible than having donors give performance reviews for professors. That being said, there is good reason to suspect that the unethical behavior that happened from 2003-2011 did not magically disappear when Cabrera took office, since the donations did not stop and obviously a lot has been kicked under the rug.

If you're not new here: instead of complaining about how unhelpful everyone is, why don't you do something about it and help?

If you are new here: it's fine to have questions and it's fine to ask them. What's not fine is lacking the forethought to do some research yourself to see if your question has been asked before, or if the answer can easily be found online. See: ""PHYS 2212 modern vs. classical????"", ""how do I build a schedule"", ""what classes do I have to take for my major"", etc.

This isn't just smartasses being elitist; knowing how to search and find answers independently is a basic, fundamental skill you need to be successful in college and your future career. On reddit you'll just get some meaningless downvotes and snarky comments from internet strangers. In real life, asking easily searchable questions you can answer with a 5 second search makes you look like a poor performer to your peers and superiors.

Oh hey you actually took my advice after I posted this comment and helped out in this thread: https://np.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/by3q13/possible_to_test_out_of_cs_1301_for_transfer/

The problem is you just said they could test out but didn't say how. Not only had the question been asked before, but your response didn't really help out OP all that much besides just confirming their initial question - there probably would've been a follow up ""then how do I sign up to test out of CS 1301"" question shortly afterwards.

If OP had just searched ""gatech cs 1301 test out"" on Google, they would've been able to find threads on Reddit (the top results) not only confirming that it *is* possible to test out of 1301, but instructions for **how** to do it and **who** to reach out to for more info - much more useful than ""Yes you can.""",positive,0.9706,positive,0.17330156402737054,06/07/2019

We have clubs for just about any interest you might have. You can check them out at FASET or at the recruitment drive that happens at the beginning of the fall. Also, idk if you're Christian but if you are (or aren't, that's fine too) I highly recommend getting plugged into a campus ministry: they're a fantastic way to make some really deep and lasting friendships.
2. You're the only one who can really answer this question since you know what you need/want, but keep in mind if you find out you need something that you didn't bring you can always buy it here. (Or bring it later if you're commuting as someone else said)
3. I'm not biochem but generally those programs of study are more loose recommendations rather than strict guidelines. The best advise is going to come from other biochem students and other students in general. There's plenty of advise about choosing your first classes on this sub if you search around.

comments,"I won't argue that it's not bad PR, or that it didn't look bad. I actually agree. Assault cases on campus should not be handled by the campus either, but the full criminal justice system. Beyond that, students shouldn't be restricted from seeking training or arms to protect themselves against attackers, in particular the smaller or younger students. But that's not our topic here. Our topic is emotional outbursts about a school hosting activities that enhance the academic experience on campus. There are certainly arguments against each individual's participation in a campus event. I will argue that emotions are not arguments, however, and that it's not the school's responsibility to address student emotional troubles. Advancing the academic sphere is the primary goal of the school, and that's what the school should do.   


Students who bind their entire lives around a traumatic event should seek help, instead of demonizing some public figure they don't even know. I say that as a victim, who didn't scream and squeal about big bad boogeymen during his time in college, even when the school or student body engages in activities that poke and prod those old wounds.",positive,0.4956,neutral,-0.014002267573696138,06/08/2019

comments,"GT athletics does not have a net positive cash flow on its own. It is heavily subsidized by mandatory student athletic fees. Only 20 schools in the nation have athletic programs that turn a profit and we are not one of them.

From a monetary standpoint all sports besides football, basketball, and baseball should be cut. Those are the only sports that turn a profit or have enough of a fan turnout in baseballs case to be justified. I bet 95% of students at Tech have never been to a game for a sport outside the big 3. There‚Äôs no reason when college is already so expensive that a Tech student should have to pay over $1000 over 4 years just to subsidize sports teams that can‚Äôt turn a profit. Athletes in the obscure sports shouldn‚Äôt get a free ride while regular students at Tech have to take out loans just to cover their mandatory athletic fee.

comments,"I will probably be downvoted to oblivion for this reply, but to some extent I agree. Although I am a Five Stripes/Courage/Dream fan and myself have played, it does not make sense for higher ed to make money off their students (who aren't even paid!), then ask them to dish out more money when the athletic programs are still in the red. Not to mention the whole concept of priority admission for student athletes. If that happened abroad, it would be considered corrupt.

Now, would it be possible for Tech to get rid of athletics completely? No. As many others have said, college sports are a factor for many prospective students, a connection for alumni, and the farm system for many professional sports. To get rid of college sports would take a complete overhaul of American collegiate culture - prospective students would have to think beyond student life in their decisions, alumni would need to magically become less sentimental, and the pros would all need to adopt the academy system as seen in soccer. Tech is meshed hard into the system like everyone else, and it would be extremely difficult to get out. (Just look at all the salty replies to this post - students and alumni are so not letting go!)

As long as Tech is primarily American, particularly in the South, there's not much that can be done. The least we can do in my opinion is to mandate pay for all NCAA D1 athletes, eliminate student-athlete status as an admissions factor, and make athletics fees voluntary. When the programs are inevitably still in the red, get the deficit from sentimental alumni and those students who are fans.",positive,0.7598,neutral,0.003833333333333331,06/10/2019

comments,"Other schools I‚Äôve been to give any student free admission to any sport outside of football and basketball and don‚Äôt charge a mandatory athletic fee. For football and basketball students would buy student season tickets for a reasonable price. Under that model only students who wanted to, financially supported the athletics teams. Techs model forces students with no interest whatsoever to financially support the sports teams. I like sports but I don‚Äôt believe others that don‚Äôt and are just here to get an education should have to foot the bill for me. It is also a market distortion to have a guaranteed revenue stream. For most businesses cash motivates them to do better. Techs athletic administrators don‚Äôt have to face a fair economic market structure.  Maybe that‚Äôs why Tech athletics has been well you know how it‚Äôs been the last decade. The GT athletic departments current spending rates are not sustainable if it were a private business and had to face the market.

From 2010-2014 GT athletics took in over $35 million in subsidies. Maybe we wouldn‚Äôt have shitty dining if this wasn‚Äôt the case. Fact of the matter is we along with 100‚Äôs of other schools are playing keep up with the Jones (the 23 self supporting athletic programs) when we really can‚Äôt afford to. We then try to artificially make ourselves better by taxing the students. There‚Äôs no reason why coaches in sports that have always operated in the red should make $200,000 + a year.

I think hoping he doesn't charge you the full amount can really blow up in your face if he does, in fact, choose to charge you the full amount, and the last thing you need is that kind of stress during your first few months at GT. I would lean towards looking at apartments a little farther away for cheaper. Although you will have to commute to campus, at least you'll have the peace of mind of not having to deal with a shitty landlord. After that first year or so, you can get to know other graduate students and perhaps arrange to live with them. Another option is living in west midtown. One bed / one bath apartments are kind of pricey (can range between $1,200 to $1,500), but if you can manage to find a roommate, you'll be able to get a 2 bed / 2 bath for between $1,800 - $2,000 in total (which would include a rather high quality apartment and no shitty landlord).

Both of those activities give you crucial skills that employers are looking for on a resume and in this case in particular, it‚Äôs an excellent way to learn the specifics of how a system such as a car is designed and put together.

The only place you‚Äôre really going to be surrounded by fellow freshmen is through FE, and FE makes it so easy to make friends just by living and sleeping in the same building together. You, living off campus, might be spending all day on campus, but you're not *living* on campus. So many ad-hoc events, parties, game nights, late night runs to WaHo, etc. happen at night after everyone's gone back to their dorms. 

I met my core group of friends because we all happened to live in the same dorm, and other friends in other dorms had similar experiences with their friend groups.

Relative to the rest of the country, colleges are a massive hotbed for sexual assault, and I can easily see why people would think that this decision would depress reporting of sexual assault on campus. The likelihood that a victim files a report with the school is intrinsically tied to their trust in the institution to follow through with their complaint.

With the addition of the $1000 fine for riding Birds on the sidewalk, I just want to say that everyone is safer when you're on the road.  Riding something like a Bike or Scooter that goes 12-15 mph on the sidewalk can result in getting right/left-hooked while crossing intersections or driveways as drivers aren't trained to look for things moving that fast on the sidewalk.

If you like the scooters, use them frequently, I'd encourage you to please join me in petitioning our city officials to continue investing in LIT lanes and especially cycle tracks (Luckie St, 10th St, Peachtree Center Ave, etc).  They go a long way towards safer commutes, greener commutes, and quicker commutes (for both drivers and cyclists).

In fact, at that same time, the Provost came out and made a statement about how ""gifts"" from donors should not have strings or demands attached, like the ones in question did.

Right after that statement was made, there was a university wide email stating that the Provost was currently under review to keep his position and that they wanted student opinions about him to use. They then changed a townhall about an unpopular tuition hike to be hosted by the Provost instead of the original officials. It was very weird to watch in real time.

Cabrera also somehow got large salary increases even though the administration kept claiming that the university was ""in debt"".

He was a pretty good president when it came to expanding mason and getting our name out there and getting donors or such in. However, he didn‚Äôt seem to really have much or a plan for us, the students, or he just didnt really care. A few examples:

‚Ä¢ probably the biggest one for me: he tore down apartment complexes on campus called ‚ÄúStudent Apartments.‚Äù Yes, they were old (built in the 70s) and had issues with the pipes freezing and a washing machine caught on fire or something. However, he displaced thousands of students and there was no and still is no plan to build more housing. Instead their idea was to remove housing for students with the most amount of credits, ie Seniors and force them to live in ‚Äúforced triples‚Äù (a normal room with a bunk bed + another bed). This caused students like me, who live over 4 hours away from the campus, to have to find housing off campus for the year.

‚Ä¢ Brett Kavanaugh scandal. In the three years I‚Äôve been at mason, there‚Äôs been numerous sexual assault cases reported and many I‚Äôm sure that have been unreported. In the mist of all of that, Cabrera announced that Brett Kavanaugh would be teaching a class this summer. This sparked protest across campus and lots of people were very angry with the decision. Cabrera‚Äôs response was basically [yeah well, people want to take the class, so whatever](https://president.gmu.edu/questions-about-recent-law-school-hires/). On paper, this is a genuinely big ‚Äúget‚Äù for the university to have the Supreme Court Justice teaching classes here. I just can‚Äôt understand how they thought it would be a good idea after all of the huge allegations and testimony.

‚Ä¢ There was [another big scandal about the Koch Brothers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/us/koch-donors-george-mason.html) influencing university decisions like naming the law school, and the hiring and firing of professors with donations.

For very popular courses, seats available and even newly created sections are not accurately represented for a while, which can screw you out of a class you need if you rely on Courseoff during registration.

However, Tech doesn't supply any kind of schedule *planning* tool (beyond manually looking up sections by department then course), which is where Courseoff and the like are very valuable. Furthermore, it's very useful for seeing how your classes actually fit together on a calendar, which is great for planning and avoiding accidental conflicts. Tech will tell you to use the ""week at a glance"" feature of OSCAR, but let's be honest, it's an unintuitive, clunky piece of shit. Better than nothing, but text with no graphical representation of duration is pretty useless for scheduling.

Tldr: use Courseoff for planning and seeing how your schedule fits into the calendar.

As a former CS major that took it, it really was Python 2 (extended 1301) at least in the first half. We reviewed Python concepts then spent sometime on databases (MySQL). His website has all his lecture slides and practice exercises and tests were VERY VERY similar to practice exams and honestly straightforward (Simpkins expressed how he hated CS questions that tested syntax and didn't really try to trick you on the exams).

In truth, I agree with you, but the courts might not (depending on the specifics of the checkpoint). 

To GTPD, I'd recommend crossing your T's and dotting your i's on this mess. A great deal of good intentions have gone bad with checkpoints to establish our case law. Alongside that, consider whether a checkpoint will really improve safety, compared to simply posting an officer at the intersection. You likely won't catch distracted drivers with a giant roadblock and flashing lights. I wouldn't be ashamed to be proven wrong on that, though.

Just the flashing lights of the car alone, placed where they are visible from most directions would likely have the same general effect as the checkpoint, in catching drivers' attention and thus reducing distraction. Beyond that, having this posted officer guiding traffic could help as well.

Also consider reputation. You guys have a great deal of support from the locals. I'm generally not supportive of police departments, but you guys have demonstrated a completely different attitude towards police work than the departments I interacted with in the past.

Transfers would typically have some of the core classes done, and don't add to the strain of Faculty trying to have enough space for incoming freshman. This is likely due to the fact that as you progress through the curriculum, students branch off into their major-specialized classes.

Its alot easier to accommodate a transfer who has all their core classes completed and just needs the upper-level major classes than a new freshman who has to take all the same core classes as every other new college student.

comments,"**Law of excluded middle**

In logic, the law of excluded middle (or the principle of excluded middle) states that for any proposition, either that proposition is true or its negation is true. It is one of the  so called three laws of thought, along with the law of noncontradiction, and the law of identity. The law of excluded middle is logically equivalent to the law of noncontradiction by De Morgan's laws. However, no system of logic is built on just these laws, and none of these laws provide inference rules, such as modus ponens or De Morgan's laws.

comments,"Hey!

So I know of two students who were denied via conditional acceptance (the year after I was accepted by the same program). The only reason they were denied was because they were quite far below the minimum requirement in terms of GPA. They were then admitted via regular admissions process, so even if you don't get conditional there is still a chance.

However, for a student that meets all the requirements it's virtually impossible to be denied (given that all aforementioned requirements are met). I was super nervous before my decision, so I understand the fear. But you'll be fine! Best of luck and keep us posted!",positive,0.9177,positive,0.14305555555555557,06/14/2019

Remember that the accused has the ***""presumption of innocence""***, and is thus **""Innocent until proven guilty""**?

see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption\_of\_innocence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence)

Would you deny the accused an international [human right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_right) under the [UN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN)'s [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights), Article 11?

*Brett Kavanaugh* was accused by one woman for an alleged incident over 30 years ago. There was no physical evidence, no corroborating testimony, and Dr. Ford would get shredded by a defense lawyer. Frankly, after Ford testified, the defense would submit a motion for a directed verdict, which would likely be granted. The D.A. might even be sanctioned by the judge for bringing the case and wasting the court's time

*Harvey Weinstein* and *R. Kelly* have been accused by multiple women over recent allegations. They deserve to face their accusers in court. Since they are not politicians, they can sue for slander.

When they are proven guilty, then neither should teach at GaTech.

Should they not be proven guilty, after their cases are settled...

Harvey Weinstein? Film students could learn a ton from him...

R. Kelly? Music students could learn a ton from him...

Marijuana use, possession and sale is still criminal in Georgia and Atlanta.  The fines and punishment were recently reduced by the Atlanta City Council but it‚Äôs still illegal.  I can only speak for GTPD and not APD but it‚Äôs still an arrestable offense for us.  The option to arrest is usually left to the officers and supervisors discretion. This depends on the situation and the amount, under 1oz is a misdemeanor and over an ounce is a felony.  The sale is still a felony. 

It can also have lots of negative impacts on you as a GT student.  If caught it will go to the dean of students and could affect your housing or enrollment, depending on the particular situation.

Bottom line... while it‚Äôs not the crime of the century... it‚Äôs still illegal and can have negative impacts on you legally and at GT. I advise against it. -Ofc. Crabtree",negative,-0.9825,negative,-0.15303030303030304,06/14/2019

comments,"I've spent time at The Standard and SQ5 and did a lot of research; hopefully some of this is helpful

Standard: Very new with some construction ongoing. Unbeatable pool deck, seriously just gorgeous. Location is decent, a block south of 5th street. Rooms are nice with tons of layouts to choose from, and are nearly as nice as SQ5. Unfortunately I've heard nothing but complaints about management, both during construction and now... The fact that they screwed over so many students by not having rooms ready in time alludes to their level of care for students. It's also a truly massive building.

SQ5: Although not as new, is kept up extremely well by management. Location is simply unbeatable for off-campus housing. The new digital turnstyles (letting people into the building remotely with your phone) is a great idea and seems to work well. Much smaller capacity than the Standard, with smaller common areas to match (gym, pool, lounge). From my experience, it's quieter than the Standard (and uhouse). Less parties in the common areas and stuff. Management staff is OK. Rooms are fantastic and so are the views on the upper floors.

Flats: Don't really know much about this place but it's very far from main campus, and in a slightly sketch place.",positive,0.9871,positive,0.10061904761904764,06/15/2019

comments,"Tech's only transfer requirements are that you have graduated high school by the time the application form comes out and that you have *completed* the requisite number of credit hours when you apply. For summer term, the application is due January 15 - based on the language on Tech's website and your post, it does not sound like you will be eligible to transfer for summer 2020. The earliest you could transfer is for Spring 2021, as the application for that opens in July. 

A word of advice from someone who thought they would transfer: freshman year of college, don't think about transferring, about GT, etc. I got rejected from my dream school and ended up at Tech and I thought I would transfer to my dream school the first chance I got, but I spent so much time enjoying myself at Tech that I decided against it.

comments,"A bit late on the draw, but clearing up what actually happened, coming from a close source with Hoeting. Going back about 3-4 years, Tech was having problems with data breeches (which continues to be a problem, it‚Äôs very difficult to stay ahead of hackers). At the time, Cisco provided the security for the information stored at Tech. After numerous breeches, Hoeting decided Cisco was not meeting the needs of the Institute, therefore he suggested partnership with a company that he had used in the past and knew would be a good fit. At the time, Hoeting informed his boss that he had used the new company before at a different university, thus he knew some of the employees and the quality of their product. His boss agreed that the new company was the best fit for the Institute. Georgia Tech, being the biggest account for a sales rep at Cisco, was, of course, no longer a customer. The sales rep that lost the account filed the ethics complaint out of rage, making many false accusations, and threatened Hoeting‚Äôs family because of the lost account. Tech investigated the complaint and deemed it non-factual, as Hoeting had been upfront and transparent with the switch. Over the same time period, the University System became more and more frustrated with Tech because they were the most independent school in Georgia; they didn‚Äôt rely on the money allocated by the University System, thus were quite powerful on their own. The University System had managed to get all other vice presidents at Tech removed, as a power play for the System. Hoeting was the last VP standing. Knowing this, they uprooted the 2-year-old ethics complaint in 2017, despite its dismissal by Tech HR. This was their leverage to remove Hoeting from Tech. They interviewed numerous people at Tech, interviewed Hoeting, interviewed people both from Cisco and the new company, and reviewed Hoeting‚Äôs personal bank statements and emails from the past 4 years. The University System compiled a report of completely nonfactual information and submitted it to the executives at Tech for them to respond. The day before Hoeting‚Äôs resignation, the breech occurred. Although the breech was not his responsibility, nor did the staff that maintains the security of the data report to him, he took the brunt of it. He resigned the next day.

In retrospect, no matter what you may think happened, Hoeting was a one-of-a-kind leader. His direct reports at the Institute worked after hours compiling a list of reasons Hoeting should not be removed, cried when he resigned, and continue to call him weekly for advice and general conversation. In the midst of this ordeal, Hoeting traveled 16 hours each weekend to see his family. He was told by his doctor that if he stayed at Georgia Tech, the stress from the day-to-day job would kill him before 55.  Hoeting is not a politician and has always claimed politics are his least favorite part of the job. After working with him for years, I can say he‚Äôll be a great leader wherever he winds up.",negative,-0.9807,positive,0.08933566433566434,06/16/2019
comments,"So you're saying that giving them a platform to speak about their issues won't help anything? Racial inequalities won't be fixed in a day but not allowing people to talk about the discriminations that they have been facing will not help either. GT can do A LOT to help. There are so many uninformed people (regardless of race) out there that need to be educated on this matter. I'm an international student, and when I first came to the US I was little informed about the racial-religious structure in the south.

comments,"I think the difference between us is that you think they are victimizing themselves, while I think they are spreading awareness and showing us their perspective. After I read the posts, I realized I may have also unintentionally participated in racism when I was silent on occasions. Someone tweeted that as the only black person in their group, all the other team members would double check her work to ensure it was good quality. Unfortunately, I remember two semesters ago when I was in a group of 8 with one African American student who was a student athlete and two other team members would ALWAYS check his work before submitting our assignments. Back then, I didn't think much about it and sadly I was misinformed that these two other team members thought less about our African American peer. Now that it has been brought to my attention, I will stand up and say something because I'm educated and acknowledge I was wrong. So no, they are NOT blaming the wrong people actually. These students are going through these experiences because others don't know and it has become the norm. As students of Georgia Tech, its our duty to help everyone feel equally welcome and respected. Peace out.

edit: Just to point out how biased the other two team members were, there was also a white female student cheer leader on our team who was equally absent as the other African American student. Her work was NEVER checked.",negative,-0.3747,neutral,-0.044940476190476183,06/16/2019

Outside of the ""bonding because it's so shitty"" ones (e.g. Smith), it's a crock of shit. The social qualities of a dorm are solely determined by the random luck of who you happen to get on your hall and are not in any way tied to any specific dorm/floor. Certain dorms (Glenn/Towers) may trend off of who paid their deposit first, but that's it.

Honestly, I think people put way too much thought into which building holds the closet they live in for two semesters. Yeah, some are nicer than others, but in the end it's a just a freshman dorm.

Writing is not some unlearnable life skill. Yes, certain people are better at it than others, but assuming you didn't flunk out of English in HS (in which case you probably won't survive at Tech) then you should be able to write an essay that impresses Tech. Putting together an impressive application isn't exact difficult, just time consuming. If you argue that sometimes naturally gifted people just don't have as impressive of an essay as others, then maybe they should have done more in HS...       

On a side note, I for one have enjoyed Tech's growing prestige. Even most OOS people know at least a bit of our reputation and it's nice saying ""I'm attending Georgia Tech"" when people I've never met react with ""wow, great school!"".

comments,"A lot of people have already commented on this, but here are some of my thoughts as a recent OOS graduate:

&amp;#x200B;

* I certainly don't feel that Georgia Tech has become too elite. The school is not on a path to become ""Ivy League"" material. It is still a school to primarily serve the people of Georgia. It just so happens to be really good and who doesn't want to continue to strive to be better?
* Georgia Tech certainly places some value on ""lineage,"" but it shouldn't guarantee admission.
* I am perplexed by the decision from the Board of Regents to keep the number of engineering and medical schools in the state of Georgia to a ""minimum."" Shouldn't more competition force everyone to do better? In general, this allows for students to have more chances in studying engineering, medicine, etc. at the in-state rate.
* Yes, a lot of practical engineers come out of Tech, but once again, it shouldn't hold the school back from  wanting to be better. We're still going to produce practical engineers, just better ones.
* Keeping faculty strictly from the state of Georgia essentially reduces the diversity of thoughts and ideas that are exchanged. 
* Georgia Tech admits people that are good at putting applications together AND are good at math and science, ""by nature."" The point of the application is to let admissions officers know what you can bring to the community. If you can't put a ""good application"" together, then why should they take the chance and let you in? Scores aren't the only way to putting together a good application.
* Lastly, as for the PhD jab, they clearly don't know that its usually PhDs that are the lead scientists (or another similar role) leading the projects that your ""purely practical engineers"" are working under. Academia isn't for everyone, even for PhDs and increasing the rigor of the material doesn't necessarily imply that you're being brainwashed into going for a PhD. GTFOH

And in fifteen seconds, I had two high-quality alternatives to try out. There are more alternatives in the repo, too, if these don't suit me. I just don't see how Windows can compete with that kind of ease of use. 

ModelSim is corporate freemium software, and its Wikipedia article hints that it has potentially received the closed-source kiss of death: its publisher was acquired in a merger in 2017. I don't know about this case in particular, but it can be a very bad sign for corporate software titles. They don't necessarily bring over the dev team along with the IP rights. Why pay devs to maintain a codebase when you can just resell the same old IP forever? 

Since I've never used ModelSim, this isn't a statement about this software in specific. But in general, the ""usability"" question has been coming down more and more on the Linux side, simply because corporate software is so rarely even in the ""make working software"" business these days.

comments,"You've got a really high chance of getting the classes you need.

Just as u/mmagicbear said, you could register for those classes yourself, and if you know how the system works and what to look for, feel free to do so. However, the registration process can be confusing. It definitely was for me. You might accidentally attempt to register for classes that have different prerequisites, or geared towards a major different than yours, or any other barrier to entry. The buzzport system will display an error, and then you'll have to go through the process of searching your classes up again, and you might not get the schedule you want. 

What's good is that the Registrar and FASET staff run a registration help desk of sorts. If it's anything like the last 3 years, you'll be given a time to line up outside a room. Inside that room will be a good chunk of the FASET leaders helping students one-on-one like yourself register, with advisors next to them. In past years, that help was geared towards solely getting you into classes. There have been changes over the years, and now the leaders teach you the registration system. They also can elevate issues you're having to advisors, who can do fancy things such as give you 'overload permits'. Some Registrar staff are also nearby, and they will help you through any registration holds you might have on your account.

Again, if you're confident, feel free to register yourself. I recommend the peace of mind that comes with the FASET staff, advisors, and Registrar actively helping you get the schedule you need.",positive,0.9869,positive,0.11745370370370371,06/19/2019

What really matters is that a student has pursued the most rigorous coursework available, has not only participated in but held leadership positions in various organization and can write an authentic and personal essay.

comments,"Highlights from the Executive Summary

* 22,831 students contacted, 2,724 completed the survey, 11.9% response rate

* Large majorities of responding students view the overall climate of GT positively. Over 80 percent of graduate and undergraduate respondents agreed that GT is a generally comfortable and inclusive environment, and over 85 percent that their academic aspirations are supported by GT. Among respondents, 79 percent of undergraduates and 86 percent of graduates agreed that they feel valued and respected by the GT community.

* Differences in the perception of the GT climate among responding men and women are relatively small: over 80 percent of both genders agree that GT is a generally comfortable and inclusive environment. Among undergraduates, women were generally more likely to agree that students at GT were respected regardless of personal characteristics, with the exception of gender and gender identity: 73.3 percent compared to 82.8 percent of men.

* Among responding Underrepresented Minority (URM) undergraduates, 78 percent agreed that GT is a generally comfortable and inclusive environment (compared to 86 percent of non-URM respondents). For graduate students, the differences were starker: 77.9 percent of URM respondents agreed versus 91.8 percent of non-URM respondents.

* A large majority of respondents agree that GT is supportive of diversity and inclusion goals: over 85 percent of undergraduate and 90 percent of graduate respondents agree that commitment to diversity is demonstrated by GT.

* Among both graduate and undergraduate respondents, women felt diversity is integral to GT‚Äôs ability to fulfill its mission was more true than men (93.2 versus 81.4 percent).

* Similarly, differences in attitudes arose by ethnicity, with undergraduate URM respondents less likely to agree that GT effectively recruits students from diverse backgrounds (75.7 percent) than their non-URM cohorts (86 percent).

* While supportive of diversity, students did not indicate participating in intercultural activities to the same degree. Less than one in five students indicated often participating in student-focused cultural organizations, attending cultural celebrations and holidays, or arts and entertainment.

* Student perceptions and opinions have shifted. Compared to the respondents from 2013, students felt there was less respect based on various characteristics and reported overall less participation in activities outside of your own culture as well as comfort in discussing issues of diversity. Students also felt that language and culture were less of a barrier for interaction between U.S. and international students, and reported lower instances of disparaging remarks in the past year, with a few exceptions.",positive,0.998,positive,0.11977973007384767,06/19/2019

comments,"The courses are okay. There are some parts of theory CS that GT is really good at (randomized algorithms, optimization) and as a result, the classes are very interesting too. On the other hand there are some courses which are boring or slow; for example CS 4510. We used to have phenomenal complexity theorists here, but many have left so there aren't that many courses for learning complexity theory at GT.

The math department here is great, I spend most of my time there. I've also found a great community of theory CS peers and mentors. Research scene can be a bit small since there aren't that many TCS faculty and they often do similar things (there are more research options available if you look in the math department though).

comments,"It was bad 10 years ago, but it‚Äôs not now. I mentioned in my earlier post about not walking alone at night‚Äîand the spirit of that is just to be smart by not making yourself a target. There‚Äôs not home break-ins or that kind of stuff. In recent history, the only problems have been people getting mugged for their phone and laptop. In addition, the Stingerette will take you to your house if you don‚Äôt have a car or bike. I‚Äôve lived in Home Park for 3 years, have never had a problem, and love it. Another nice thing about Home Park is that (in my estimation) about 70% of the residents are in some form Tech students‚Äîwhich you‚Äôre not likely to find anywhere else off campus. 

Also, it should be noted that any of the ‚Äúcheap‚Äù options like Home Park or Centennial Apartments (where crime is currently worse‚Äîsuch a muggings and carjackings) are automatically less safe than a gated apartment with security guards and stuff like that‚Äîthat‚Äôs part of why it‚Äôs cheaper. But, there still is similar crime in all of Midtown Atlanta surrounding campus. 

With all that in mind, you have to decide what your priorities are and then decide where to make compromises because there‚Äôs no such place as a cheap private bedroom and bathroom where there is no crime in Midtown. I personally don‚Äôt think the crime aspect of Home Park is anything to be afraid of, but I‚Äôm a 250 pound guy that has a car‚Äîso take what I say with a grain of salt.",positive,0.1797,positive,0.09197994987468672,06/19/2019

As noted in the blurb below about early action, Tech's early action admits came from 95 of the states 159 counties.   

I can no longer find the stats on actual overall attendance by county, but am certain that many (mostly poor, rural) counties in Georgia send NO students, or very very few to Georgia Tech.   

This is wrong. Georgia should adopt a policy that the top 1 or 2% (Texas has shown that 10% is too high) of graduates from each county in the state will be automatically admitted to the state college of their choice.   

Talented students should not be de facto denied the chance to get a world class education simply because they chose parents who raised them in a poor part of the state below the gnat belt.

Try and ask yourself if you want to go to a research oriented lab or to do VIP. Generally, VIP is for people who want to do stuff closer to industry. Also, make sure to review requirements for Junior Design.

3) is there any kind of itinerary for faset, i.e. roughly what do we do each day?

Another way is to ask the professors that you know and have taken classes with. During my undergrad I did the same.  
Also, there are some professors that heavily invest on undergrads (not my lab!). I think you can ask around and find who are they, Thad Starner is one of them.  


Here is my personal experience and suggestions:

My general suggestion is that be open to any opportunity you find (i.e., don't just look for machine learning things...). Honestly, working with undergrads is time consuming. This is not because you are undergrad, it is because you are trying to jump in a middle of a research project, understand what we have done till now, and move some parts forward. So, if someone is willing to do it and put you there, just take it. In my work, I generally give the first few weeks just to get to know how to work around and read stuff (Like actually learn how to ssh, use vim, or scp...).  
Main thing is to show up, ask questions, and try to understand things. I find it hard that undergrads treat research credits as similar to their courses (you get assigned to something, you just do it, and you think you are done...). Research never ends... If you do more, I will give you more stuff to do, and then maybe you would be able to be part of a paper. In my experience, these kind of people are really rare.

comments,"&gt;we recommend that you take as close to 12 credit hours as possible

Rising 4th-year here.  I think it's better to consider what's best for your plan to graduate as well as what classes you need to take - not get hung up on number of credit hours.  

On one hand, it's great to start out with a light schedule.  That way there's more time for adjusting to college, bonding with friends, trying out extracurricular activities, etc.

However, a light schedule every semester may not be sustainable, and/or adjusting to more later on can be difficult.  Many degrees recommend \~15 hours per semester to graduate in 8 semesters (assuming only fall and spring terms, not summer).  From what I've seen, people who take less than that while being full-time usually

* pay in-state tuition, 
* come in with lots of AP or DE credits (p.s. stop bragging about being a junior by credit hours, sweeties), or
* both

Meanwhile, graduating with my ME degree in 8 semesters with no outside credits takes between 15 and 18 credits each semester (the 129 hours do not divide up evenly) ([Source](https://www.me.gatech.edu/files/ug/program_of_study_me1920.pdf)).  Going lighter for a semester or two means making it up for it later on.

Personally, I wanted to graduate in 4 years without taking summer classes (interning instead of studying abroad).  I had credit for 2 classes coming in.  My first semester, I took 14 hours (5 classes, including GT 1000) and took 15-16 hours (5 classes still) through my sophomore year.  This past fall I took 17 to take care of two 1-credit classes, and in the spring I took 18 so I wouldn't have to do that as a senior.  This year, I will take 15 each semester.

Also note that credit hours don't necessarily correlate to workload.  For example, my first semester (calculus, chemistry, U.S. history, health, GT 1000) was less work than my second (Matlab, ME 1770, English, physics, linear algebra), which was one hour more.  Other classes are known to be difficult or very time-consuming, and it's generally advisable to plan lighter semesters around them, if possible.  

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:  I disagree with recommending 12 hours as a blanket statement, as it is not suitable for all schedules.  Consider what you need to take and when you intend to graduate.  Then, plan accordingly.  Tech is challenging but manageable - you can do this!",positive,0.9662,positive,0.13255208333333335,06/20/2019

comments,"I've been on T-Mo postpaid for 3 years at GT commuting and was perfectly fine and I get 20mbps+ on and off campus. Granted, the signal sometimes gets weak in the inner part of large buildings on campus, but you can go on WiFi in that case. One thing to note about MVNO(carriers like Mint and Unreal) is that network carrier's (such as T-Mobile and AT&amp;T) traffic is prioritized over MVNO's traffic, and you may experience slowdowns in an area where there's a lot of traffic.

If you're wondering speed differences between T-Mo and Mint, [this test was done in Atlanta.](https://youtu.be/Hu_Agy6Is88)

If you do stream videos a lot, you might also want to note that T-Mo's essential plan throttles videos down to 480p speeds unless you purchase HD streaming pass. This can easily be circumvented by using a VPN, but you'd be paying extra for VPN service and some streaming sites like Netflix block VPN connections. On Mint Mobile, videos are not throttled, but they count towards your monthly LTE allowance, and when that's exhausted all your data is throttled to 2G speeds.

On a side note, if you plan on studying abroad, I highly recommend Google Fi. You get LTE data at the same cost in most countries.",positive,0.8781,positive,0.06105616605616605,06/21/2019

comments,"Here's my perspective for you to consider: The Professional Masters in Applied Systems Engineering (PMASE) is a great program. The program enabled me to launch a second career in a new direction after spending 20 years in the military. Additionally, the association with Ga Tech in my new line of work helps me brand myself to be successful and credible in my new career. To answer your specific questions:

 How competitive are admissions? 

Not sure, but not everyone that applied for my cohort was admitted. Source: The Ga Tech staff held a Q&amp;A during the first week of school.

 How has the program helped you in your career so far? 

It helped me launch a new career.

 What is career outcome you hope to get from this degree? 

Doing systems engineering or test engineering for the government or one of the big prime defense contractors.

 Does the online factor take away any value from the program compared to a traditional, full time program? 

This is a complicated question. On the surface, the quick answer is no. There are always trade-offs to analyze when considering traditional vs. online education. This program is intensively rigorous and team based. You will have a lot of team projects to complete (no tests, yay!) which is further complicated due to the online nature of the program. Ga Tech eases this complication by providing collaboration technology such as Office 365, BlueJeans (for video conferencing), Ga Tech Virtual Lab, and Canvas (the learning management system). There are also live sessions that students must attend. Some of these live sessions are done via BlueJeans and some must be done on-campus. Via BlueJeans, there are office hours held weekly and live sessions held monthly over a weekend (Friday afternoon and all day Saturday). I believe that there are three on-site four-day sessions where you have to sit on campus.

comments,"Take this advice with a grain of salt. 

In general, whatever the question(s), make it reflect you. The schools want to know about *you* through your answer. 

Be true to yourself, don't fake answers you think they want. 

If the answer to the essay is mostly information that is listed elsewhere in your application, rethink your answer. Example: Pretend you listed being the captain of soccer team on your application. The essay asks favorite movie, so you write about Bend It Like Beckham because you relate to the pressures of being a soccer player. The school already knew that you were into soccer because they read that under the activities section, so you kinda wasted a space to tell the school new information about yourself. If you choose a different movie, you can explore a different facet of your life and personality. **Note:** if you are involved in an activity in many different ways, please list all of them if you can. (There is a limit to how many things you can list, so you will have to prioritise, but don't willy nilly leave something off just because you listed a similar activity elsewhere.) Example: being in math club (listed under activities), taking advanced math classes (listed on transcript), volunteering to tutor math students (listed under activities), winning a math award (listed under awards). All of these show a commitment in various ways to math, which the school will be very happy to see. It could be anything- doesn't have to be math. Could be art, juggling, school, whatever.  

If the essay asks ""What is your favorite movie?"", the school doesn't want a review of the movie. Answer about why the movie is your favorite- you relate to the movie, the character, or the storyline because of Y, or you are inspired by the movie, the character, or the storyline because of Y, or you love it because of [personal reason]. 

If the essay asks ""Who do you admire?"", the school doesn't want to know how great this person is. The schools wants to know how and why you relate and admire the person.

&amp;#x200B;

**Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?**

For this essay prompt, I was going to talk about my general love of science and how I feel so overwhelmed at the amount of stuff to learn but also so interested as there is so much to learn about the natural world. I was planning on writing about how the internet and books have really sparked my interest in fields such as quantum and particle physics, biology in the form of CRISPR and chemistry in the form of synthesizing new elements through the bombardment of heavy elements.

**Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.**

For this essay, I was planning on talking about my love for video games which eventually spark a love of programming and electronics. In my essay, I was planning on writing how I started playing video games at a very young age and it gave me a chance to talk to people around the world in a variety of different socioeconomic backgrounds and how it eventually sparked an interest in programming and electronics through games such as Minecraft and Terraria in which I would build complex contraptions in-game and eventually would build simple mods which modified the world or bypassed a core game mechanic?

Eventually, I would begin to buy more games and learn Cpp and Java and would gain an interest in programming and electronics.

üì∑

Last month, Kursat Christoff Pekgoz, a Ph.D. student and Provost's Fellow at the University of Southern California (USC), filed a federal complaint against USC under Title IX. In the complaint, Pekgoz made the claim that USC officials retaliated against his activism on behalf of men who face sex discrimination, including in his own case of alleged sexual assault. Title IX historically defended women from sex discrimination, but given the fact that women now dominate universities (with many programs Pekgoz has termed ""affirmative action"" still in place to advance women only), Pekgoz has led efforts to defend men.

His case against USC was successful. But his battle is not over. He needs your help to continue this fight on behalf of men who have been treated grossly unfairly and in many cases illegally by their current and former colleges and universities by Title IX administrators and others. He is currently preparing to take on Title IX suits against Harvard, Cornell, and several other universities. His precedent is a powerful start. He MUST keep the momentum going to either alter the operation of Title IX offices OR close them altogether.

Kursat, so far, has taken on his advocacy pro bono. However, the time has come for him to ask for help. He can no longer sustain his effort out of his own pocket and is asking for your help.

To help Kursat continue his success and his efforts, he needs your help. Please click the link to learn more and donate.

Thank you!

Depending on what HS, 3.5 is low, admittedly, but also HS GPA's are mostly meaningless since they vary so much. Biggest thing you can do is to:

1. Do something technology related. A club, class, personal projects, something. Especially if you're going into your JR year. Remember you're competing against kids who have been in robotics clubs since 6th grade.
2. Get your GPA up 
3. Study your butt off for SAT/ACT, get a perfect or nearly perfect score to be competitive

As for making bad assumptions, that's something that you should be able to cut down on by really going over every old exam problem you have in detail. If you don't already, go to the PLUS sessions, they have more problems to work. The exams tend to ask similar kinds of problems as in the past (albeit in different scenarios and asking for different things), so the old questions are your best resource outside of the professor/TAs.

comments,"in omojokun's 1331 class rn and TAs carry the class, videos aren't enough to understand the hw, and his voice is about as exciting as the Quizlet autoplay audio.

I feel like he  just sends out a piazza message once a week notifying people that the hw has been released, delegates the ""teaching"" to the 19 year old TAs, and records some dry af video lectures. The pedagogy of this course is really ill considered, and the learning experience is the lowest quality of any Tech course that I've taken.

btw I (and other ppl taking the class) had no idea it was hybrid until the first day of class. that might be my fault but yeah

4.	Yes, to an extent. It‚Äôs done by seniority and also done per semester (with some exceptions for add drop week and finals). Definitely do not expect to get all the shifts you want at first.

That being said, some people I've spoken to find it challenging, as you'll need to actually know what's going on to do well. However, if you put in the effort to understand linear to its core and realize that nearly everything you learn in the class boils down to the same concept, the class will be enjoyable and not too difficult. I also took it my first semester here and is one of the favorite courses I've taken thus far.

I would also caution against taking two classes with labs if you're not the best with project based classes. Though 1211K and 1510 shouldn't be too hard content wise, the time you spend working on lab and reports can bring you down especially your first semester here. I've taken one lab course the three semesters I've been here and I still feel like almost 50% of my time is spent on labs. Though if you're good at doing labs/projects, writing reports, etc. you should be okay, as I've heard about people that take two lab courses a semester and be absolutely fine with it, especially if 1211K and 1510 are crucial to progressing with your prerequisite chain.

Here's a quick, raw comparison I took from LinkedIn that shows where the alumni of GA Tech and UC Berkeley works. Notice the one thing in common is the majority of both lists comprise of big tech firms with HQ on West coast. UCB obviously dominates in some firms but it makes complete sense since they're right there, but the at same time, Ga Tech's number is not shy of most schools in the West.

Of course, there would be inaccuracy and bias in the data but it should be enough to tell the story.

comments,"Depends on your major or the general direction you want to go into. If you're a math or CS major, you're required to take 1554. Otherwise, either 1553 or 1554 would work. If you're thinking of going into something math intensive within your major, 1554 wouldn't harm you. However, be warned that I've heard stories about 1554 being one hell of a class. Others would disagree, but I think it still boils down to how much time you're putting into the class and truly understanding linear inside out, which would be even more crucial for 1554 than 1553. Generally, I'd say go with 1553 unless you have to take 1554 and/or you're committed to digging deeper into the subject than the average Tech student.

If you end up taking 1553 but need the 1554 knowledge in the future/change majors to CS or math, there's a course titled ""Applications of Linear Algebra"" (MATH 2802) that will fill in the gap or ""A Second Course on Linear Algebra"" (MATH 3406) which would go even deeper for you.",positive,0.5307,neutral,0.04293981481481482,06/24/2019

It also depends on how familiar you are with the subject. Since you've gotten 5's on both AP Chem and AP Bio, you can cut down a good chunk of time spent studying for the material itself and focus on the labs and assignments.

In addition, the variance of the amount of time students spend in a class is also very high. I know some students that just somehow learn quickly, only spend a few hours a week on each of their classes, and cruise through with A's, and other students that pull multiple all nighters to just pass their classes (which is perfectly fine. These students may be stronger than the students that cruise through in other classes AND they learn the valuable skill of working hard and not giving up). It seems that 3 hours per hour spent in class is about the average, maybe a little higher, but the actual time spent definitely varies considerably on a case by case basis.",positive,0.8905,neutral,0.001788065843621392,06/24/2019

comments,"Different strategies work for different people, but for me, my first semester didn't go by so well because I didn't change my study strategy from high school/community college. I did much better my second semester, and I found that it's crucial to spend more time on studying the material itself than working on assignments. Assignments and lectures (with some exceptions) merely serve as an introduction to the material. Once I complete those, I find myself actively reading the textbook and examples and working out a good chunk of the textbook problems. This helps me understand the subject deeper and internalize the concepts. Finally, about a week before exams, I start working out as many practice tests I can find online or from the professor/TAs, which helps me crack down the nitty gritty details that professors are looking for. In addition, I go to as many study sessions that I can, which would help with knowing what's going to be on the test as well. I end up spending more time than the average Tech student on classes, but I find this to be very rewarding as exams almost felt like a breeze and that I've gotten more out of a class than most students.

As for 1553, my biggest advice is focus on the concepts more than the calculations. The computations may seem like a pain, but only a few problems on the quizzes/tests rely on heavy computation. Instead, it is much more valuable to focus your time on every new concept and how it applies to certain cases and connect each theorem with everything else you've learned, as 90% of 1553 all comes down to the Invertible Matrix Theorem. It is also helpful to tackle some of these concepts from multiple angles. Think about what a new concept implies in terms of matrix algebra, and what that in turn implies geometrically, and what you can get from that in terms of eigenvalues, etc. Also, True/False questions will become your enemy. Spend some extra time on those. For my professor, 20% of each test grade was completely based off of five T/F questions.

Also, it seems that (at least for me) the TAs in the math department are absolutely awesome. My TA's study sessions and recitations were particularly useful, and was extremely kind and helpful at office hours (shoutout to her for spending hours answering my somewhat stupid questions the night before the final). I've heard good things about other 1553 TA's as well, so definitely go to your TA (or other 1553 TAs) whenever you need help with the class.

It seems like Tech's reputation in California (at least in the Bay Area) isn't even on par with UCSD/UCSB and is more on the level of UC Davis. What they fail to realize is that 1) you don't have to go to an Ivy or Stanford/Caltech/Berkeley/MIT to get a great education, and 2) for a STEM education, Tech is one of the best schools in the nation!

One of the reasons I left California for Tech is I'm sick and tired of the competitive culture out there. Not saying that competition is bad per se, but when it gets to the point where it turns into a cutthroat culture and people are almost indoctrinated to believe that if you don't get into one of the Ivies or Stanford/Berkeley/MIT you're considered a failure in life, or that if you don't major in CS or become a doctor you won't have a good future, that has gone overboard. Other than the weather, I absolutely love it here at Tech and can't imagine myself anywhere else. I also don't plan on returning to California and raising my children in that culture, at least not in the Bay Area. I digress, but I do believe that at least in the Bay Area, Georgia Tech, along with most other non-Ivy schools or schools without a ""big brand name"" is considered to be ""sub-par"" for a STEM education, and that's more because of the culture out there than the quality of the schools themselves.",negative,-0.2746,neutral,0.024476911976911975,06/24/2019

comments,"Hi, I know another and myself who decided to do both. I would strongly advise to rush the social frat first, in Fall, then delay your bid for AKPsi (if you get it lmao it's competitive) to the Spring. One reason is that Fall with social Greek Life is super fun with tailgates, larger pledge classes, and more relaxation. Spring is kind of a wind-down time for social fraternities which will give you the time to do AKPsi's pledge (which is also super time consuming btw). Another reason to do it in this order is that AKPsi demands a lot of commitment from you to be a brother (time investment and professional activities) so if you did pledge AKPsi in the Fall, you would most definitely probably end up becoming inactive for the Spring while you pledged the other social fraternity.

Idk there's only 1 benefit to doing AKPsi in the Fall which is the fact that it hyper prepares you for Career Fair in the Fall as the pledge process is tailored to you becoming a better more professional you.

comments,"Greek Life is solid if you're in it, but not really ""in your face"" if you're not.  And yes, you can be in both a social and a business frat.

There are over 20 social frats (IFC), and if you find one you vibe with, it can be a great brotherhood.  AKPsi is a little different but still has a social aspect.  Their rush is usually after the first week, whereas IFC's (and CPC's, for any ladies reading) is right at the beginning.  

I recommend looking into the social frats because their recruitment comes first, and there are more of them (as opposed to putting all your eggs in one basket).  You don't have to end up joining this semester.

I don't have a strong opinions on the amount of credits.  If you end up joining and 15 is too much, it's okay to drop a class (12 is the minimum for full-time status).  I will say, though, that people here are generally understanding if you have to step back to put academics first.",positive,0.7724,positive,0.1457440476190476,06/24/2019

comments,"*I can't speak for OMSA, but I do know a decent amount about the CS industry.*

I'm from the Bay Area, went to Georgia Tech, and currently work at a large, well known tech company in the Bay Area. In industry, GT is very well regarded.

Of my close college friends and coworkers at my TA job, around half ended up getting jobs at BigN tech companies, with probably a quarter spread between other Bay Area tech companies. The rest went to companies on the east coast.

Just walking around my tech company's campus, other tech company campuses, and silicon valley's shopping districts, you see people wearing Georgia Tech gear or people that you recognize from your classes.

Sure there's more Berkeley and Stanford alums at these big tech companies, but those schools are also within 50 miles of silicon valley. Georgia Tech's presence is impressive for a school 3000 miles away.

I'm from California. Before this post, I had never heard of CSU Dominiquez Hills. However, a decent portion of the STEM students at my HS knew about Georgia Tech.

comments,"If you are only taking Analytical, Bio, and 1 more it MIGHT be doable...

Analytical's early reports typically took me around 8-9 hours while the later reports could take up to 12-14 hours. Keeping up with lecture took about 0.5-1 hours of studying/reading per weekday. Then you have to consider that you are physically in lab for nearly 5 hours one day of the week so you are losing a lot of time. 

With that in mind, you should still have a reasonable amount of time to complete your Bio work as long as you are comfortable with the material and good at your time management when putting together lab reports. 

I think taking analytical as one of 3 classes is probably your best bet at this point. (I took it with 4 which was a BAD idea, lol)

comments,"Some classes you‚Äôll find yourself spending a solid 5 hours per hour in class. Some humanities you‚Äôll see that you can get by with studying 6 hours per midterm total. I know in my more major focused courses I find myself doing easily 12+ hours a week for a 3 credit hour course and during test weeks it‚Äôs easily 20+. However I do find myself studying a lot more than average I think. However be prepared to have days where you attend class for 5 hours, go eat, and then spend 10. hours until midnight working on assignments and studying - then repeating the next 4 days. for classes like linear- the biggest reason I saw people struggle was that they just didn‚Äôt put in the time. Nobody went to plus sessions, people didn‚Äôt really study until the night before, and then everyone complained when the midterm averages were consistently 65-70%. I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong, linear is tough! But just be prepared for the unexpected time commitment that comes with only a 2 hr class. Also one more note. You‚Äôll see that lecture is very different from high school atleast that was my case. Your professors will lecture and then you‚Äôre expected to read and interpret that info on your own time. You have only ALL the responsibility of making sure you understand content and prepare enough outside class. That‚Äôs probably the biggest reason for the 3 hours per hour people seem to agree with. Lectures are much more content packed in a college setting than high school. Another way to think about it is to consider that an AP course is worth one college class across a whole school year. A college class is like taking that AP course and doing all of it in one semester and then adding more topics to the course cus why not. My first class here at tech was radiation physics and the professor is really cool and really great but oh my I was not ready for the absolute firehose of abstract concepts I‚Äôve never seen before coming at me faster than I can write. I definitely spent a solid 12 hours a week on that course. 

So yeah overall. 3 hours per hour in class is probably about right for major courses. Maybe less for gen eds and humanities. But with class time and outside class time combined you‚Äôll probably find that school will easily take 40-50 hours a week. But don‚Äôt let that kill you, make sure to take your time and enjoy life at tech!!!",positive,0.9905,positive,0.1597105762594893,06/25/2019

comments,"As long as you're (really) good at mechanics, decently good at linear algebra, and have enough fluid mechanics intuition that aerodynamics doesn't seem like dark magic, you should be fine for the AE minor. 

I wouldn't let people scare you off too badly, but try to be as honest with yourself as possible. Physics should be your priority (you won't be doing grad studies in astrophysics, particle physics, or any kind of physics if your physics grades suck), and you'll need a strong physics base to succeed in AE, so the bottom line is that you shouldn't start the minor right off the bat, at least not beyond the one-credit AE 1601 (Intro to AE)If you find that you're struggling in your physics course, focus on your major and revisit the idea of the minor a few semesters down the road. You won't be taking aerodynamics courses in physics, so you'll be at a slight disadvantage in required courses that use aero qualitatively (such as Vehicle Performance) since you'll be riding entirely on your fluid mechanics intuition. 

Now, for the actual astrodynamics-specific advice:

Once all your mechanics, fluids, and linear algebra basics are solid, perhaps two years or so into GT, enroll in Vehicle Performance (AE 3330) and grab a copy of Fundamentals of Astrodynamics by Bates, Mueller, &amp; White (it's our intro to astro bible) from B&amp;N or from Amazon. Once you've got it, make it your sole purpose that semester to master that shit, and ask your Vehicle Performance professor questions about the textbook during office hours whenever you're stuck. Don't worry about it being far beyond the scope of the course, hopefully you'll get Dr. Saleh and he'll be delighted that you're studying ahead. 

Keep in mind, this is not an easy self-study task to complete -- several AE courses cover the material in BMW loosely, such as 3330 itself, but the average BSAE grad is \*\*far\*\* from skilled at astrodynamics before AE4532 and is 99% ignorant about it before AE3330. You may also be able to find introductory astrodynamics lectures, notes, or even books elsewhere on the internet -- don't discard them: the more you know ahead of time, the better.

If (by your third year or so, allowing enough time to build intuition) you're solid on your mechanics and you've got enough of a head start on astrodynamics, you're likely to plow straight through most AE majors in upper-level spaceflight classes, even as a physics major.",positive,0.9738,positive,0.10743650793650796,06/25/2019

Same for bare feet/socks feet, and some footwear is just plain unsafe for you to workout in. Zippers and rivets on clothing scratch and rip things like benches and straps; buttons pop off and become a hazard. Also shoes that have been worn outside pick up dirt in the treads and track that into the gym so they would prefer, but can't enforce, that your gym shoes are indoor-only shoes.

As for your question, there's not really a big reason to pick one floor over the others beside the amount of stairs you want to climb each day. Being on the 1st floor doesn't mean there won't be no stairs, but it is a bit easier than going to the 4th floor every day. If you have any other questions about Smith, I'd be happy to answer them.",positive,0.9659,neutral,0.026736111111111124,06/25/2019

comments,"Really? I've worked out at multiple gyms that had no such rules, especially for cleanliness reasons. You were expected to wipe down equipment properly after use and could lose your access to the gym if you didn't. Staph is likely to be spread through [hands and doorknobs as well](https://dph.georgia.gov/sites/dph.georgia.gov/files/related_files/site_page/ADES_Staph_skin_infections_fact_sheet.pdf), which is why you are supposed to wipe down the equipment handles as well. If you are wiping down the equipment anyway, then wearing a sports bra to run/workout should be fine. As far as sweat and ""body crud"" are concerned, they go everywhere anyway. If you are dripping sweat and go and get on a machine, the sweat is still on the machine after you get off, shirt or no shirt. The extra layer of fabric just gets wet with the sweat anyway and possibly carries more to the machine than if someone wasn't wearing a shirt. The only reason I could see the CRC wanting everyone covered is that I guess they assume the equipment won't properly be wiped down. 

I'm not sure I get your swim trunk/ board shorts comment either. Many girls, myself included don't wear underwear with athletic shorts/leggings. If a guy wears shorts and boxers, how is that different than athletic shorts without underwear? Sorry just confused on that point. 

I haven't been able to buy a pair of athletic shorts in years that didn't have at least one zippered pocket in it. Zippers in athletic shorts are usually small (if they are large they would interfere with the wearer) and shouldn't cause so much additional damage (with proper equipment use) that they should be banned. I could see zippers becoming a safety issue in any sport that could have contact, which is why I assume that is a rule in the first place. 

I also have lifted in gyms that actually encouraged the removal of shoes for certain lifts for safety reasons; losing your balance in a  squat could be very dangerous. As the CRC isn't a lifting gym, I can see why they would just rather you wear shoes. 

Not trying to come after you at all, I am more frustrated with the way these rules are presented as they, at the CRC and other gyms, don't really make sense for the claimed reason they are implemented. Personally, I believe these at least some of these rules are implemented because they want people working out in the gym to look a certain way for tours. If not for that reason, then they copied these rules from the rules of another gym and didn't really consider why they would or would not be a good idea.",negative,-0.9268,neutral,0.021188672438672437,06/25/2019

**Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging that it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more?**

For this essay prompt, I was going to talk about my general love of science and how I feel so overwhelmed at the amount of stuff to learn but also so interested as there is so much to learn about the natural world. I was planning on writing about how the internet and books have really sparked my interest in fields such as quantum and particle physics, biology in the form of CRISPR and chemistry in the form of synthesizing new elements through the bombardment of heavy elements.

**Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.**

For this essay, I was planning on talking about my love for video games which eventually spark a love of programming and electronics. In my essay, I was planning on writing how I started playing video games at a very young age and it gave me a chance to talk to people around the world in a variety of different socioeconomic backgrounds and how it eventually sparked an interest in programming and electronics through games such as Minecraft and Terraria in which I would build complex contraptions in-game and eventually would build simple mods which modified the world or bypassed a core game mechanic?

Pro tip: most of the amenities offered in your unit will be probably be outdated or broken.
When you get there, put maintenance request in for every household appliance that is outdated and maintenance will replace it.

Cons: there is no longer a security guard at night and sometimes people who are not supposed to be in the building tailgate other residents after 12pm
Parking is really bad because if your car doesn‚Äôt get broken into, it will surely be booted if not both.
Pro tip: if you have someone who needs visitor parking do not park  in visitor parking without a permit on Thursday, Friday, And Saturday. This is because the club opium is open on these days and the people who own the lot want their money.
Best tip: if you want the best room for the same price of a 4bed2bath room, make a profile that says your a clean freak, and once you enter the room, convince your roommates to bang up the place and accept being labeled as dirty.

comments,"This is actually false. I have just returned home from my FASET session, and while I did enjoy the experience, registration was a nightmare. I think I speak for everyone else at FASET 1 when I say I'm pretty disappointed that we weren't properly notified about how the registration process works. Some people had to wait hours to complete it successfully (and it's nearly impossible to get all of your first-choice courses).

Most importantly, if you are still waiting on AP scores to be released, you CANNOT get a permit to sign up for the courses you think you will take, based on the scores you think you will receive. You will have to sign up for the original class, and change your registration after AP scores are released, or during Phase II registration. I had to sign up for MATH 1551, even though I knew with 99% confidence that I would be taking MATH 1552 or MATH 1554. Some of my friends were also waiting on their scores for AP Computer Science A, and they had to register for CS 1301, instead of CS 1331, which is what they would most likely be taking.

So if you can, try to register for a FASET session AFTER your AP scores have been released, because each FASET session places a hold on the most common classes, so everyone gets an equal opportunity to register for the usual classes. One of the registration officials specifically told us that FASET acts as something similar to a ""Phase 1.5 registration,"" so registering for a later FASET does not have any significant impact on the courses available to take.",positive,0.9584,positive,0.10396825396825397,06/26/2019

Smith definitely used to have communal showers. Based on the way they look, I don't doubt for a second that they were designed to be communal. However, they installed curtains as society valued more individual modesty/privacy more, so they're not actually communal anymore. This created the problem of people having to walk through other peoples showers in order to get to or from their shower. They could end up getting stuck inside/outside the shower. On my floor, we had a rule where nobody used the front three showers so that we could all easily access the back three showers without having to walk through anyone else's shower.",positive,0.7514,positive,0.1643939393939394,06/26/2019

comments,"The approach I would take is probably not feasible from many different standpoints. I am aware that part of the ECE curriculum should follow certain rules, especially with the communication aspect that ECE 2031 has. 

I would get rid of the 2031 project completely because it's so unfair in many ways. I pretty much had two put up with two arrogant dudes in my group who made it seem like they knew everything and they did not let me contribute much to the project from a technical standpoint. Also, if you are a CS and have taken CS 2110 or similar classes (ECE 2035), you will pretty much sh*t on the project without much effort. A lot of my friends got away without doing much in this class because there was at least one person who knew assembly beforehand. This means that from a learning point-of-view, not everyone is getting out what they are supposed to from the class. I mean, I see this happening in the majority of the group projects. It's usually one or two students carrying the whole team and the rest will do the documentation. 

Also, the Quartus II software version that they use for ECE 2031 is so old (I took this class back in 2015). I do not know if whoever wrote the book thinks it's too much work to update it and use a newer version, but that was ridiculous. From what I have seen, people in the industry rarely care if you know Quartus. I have not touched that software since ECE 2031. They should probably adopt something more modern that will help the students land jobs and that is more relevant in the industry. I also found that Verilog is more relevant in the industry than VHDL. I know both are quite similar, but I don't remember learning it properly in ECE 2031. CMPE majors were exposed to it more in ECE 3056 if I recall from talking to some people. The only way you can learn Verilog is by taking that special topics class taught by some GTRI guy. Since it's not required not everyone gets to take it.

But going back to how I would do it, assuming I could break all rules, I would re-structure both ECE 2020 and ECE 2031 simultaneously. The thing here is that ECE 2031 tries to cover so much material in one semester (typical Georgia Tech thing). Honestly, the first half of ECE 2031 wasn't too bad because we learned that in ECE 2020. The second half was awful if you did not have a strong CS background. For example, if you were an EE major and you took ECE 2036, you were pretty much screwed compared to someone who took ECE 2035 (or was taking it at the same time as ECE 2031). 

But in all honesty, it would be nice if they re-structured both ECE 2020 and 2031 in such a way that it followed sequentially.  The first half should focus more on the basics of digital design (i.e., how logic gates work, k-maps, etc.). Both classes should have relevant labs that actually help you understand how things work rather than just connecting some wires and IC's here and there until they ""work."" I actually TA'd ECE 2020 and 2040 and I could tell you from a fact that a lot of the students were lost. They do such a crappy job teaching people how a breadboard works and they waste time trying to learn this on the spot rather than getting the most out of the labs.

Anyway, I feel like the labs should be re-structured in such a way that helps the students learn the concepts much better. At least for ECE 2031, I was able to do most of them by following the instructions that they had. Once I got to the SCOMP lab, I was so lost and I had no clue what was going on. 

As for the quizzes, they should probably ask more relevant things like what you expect to get on interviews. In 2020 a lot of times it was mostly solving tedious theoretical problems. In ECE 2031 the quizzes tested whatever they felt like asking based on the readings and prelab and they were pretty short (10 min long). In job interviews, they try to see how good your intuition is. Nothing like what you learn in these two classes. 

The first class that actually prepared me for interviews was ECE 6412. The professor actually made the exams somewhat similar to what they ask on interviews. e.g., if you change this parameter, how will my circuit response change? Why does this component matter in a circuit? You get the point. I did not need to have a calculator or even make a crib sheet to take these exams. I just needed to have a good intuition of what was going on (like how every good engineer should be). 

Actually, understanding how each component in a circuit works goes a long way. Even though I took both ECE 2020/2031 a long time, I don't recall being tested like this.

My computer engineering background is not that strong to tell you how to go about re-structuring for the second half of the class. I just felt like not enough background material was given to actually get what was going on. We also did not have many lectures in ECE 2031, to begin with. So it was obvious that they tried to cram as much as possible in one hour to get the most out of it.

comments,"&gt; project

Programming is only a small part of the project.  It's much more about the design process, about working in a group, and about interfacing with a physical robot.  Regardless of what it feels like as it's happening, that's what sticks with people after they're gone.

&gt; people in the industry rarely care if you know Quartus

They do if you're working with Altera FPGAs, but obviously in the grand scheme of engineering very few people are specifically working with Altera FPGAs.  Instead of telling potential employers that you've used Quartus, we recommend just saying you've developed FPGA hardware, because it's 92% the same concepts and the same IDE regardless of whether it's Altera or Xilinx or Lattice.

&gt; Quartus II software is so old

SO old, but we continue to use it for two reasons:

a) It's the latest version with that simulator tool.  Later versions use ModelSim, and students are going to get completely lost if we make them use that.

b) The latest versions don't support the DE2 board, so when we update to a newer Quartus (or other IDE if we switch brands) it's going to be at the same time as we update to new boards, which are currently being evaluated, and with that comes a new lab manual.  We're going to have to change or drop the textbook at the same time; it's barely used anymore already.

&gt; VHDL vs. Verilog

Verilog is currently a bit more popular, but similar to my previous comments, we're more interested in digital design than the language, and VHDL is overall a bit easier to learn quickly.

&gt; 2020 and 2031

What would you remove from 2020 to make room for new material or different presentation of existing material?  Personally I don't think processor architecture should be in 2020.  I'd love to use that time for more general digital design topics instead of focusing on the single application of a processor.

When I teach 2020 I do my best throughout the semester to highlight the process and the reasoning over the result.  Describing a decoder doesn't start with ""here's how a decoder works"", it starts with ""we want a device that does this"" and then becomes ""here's how we can accomplish that"" and then after we've built a decoder we stick it in a box and all we care about is its functional behavior.

&gt; quizzes

Oh god I can't even *imagine* the complaining if we gave 20-minute, tough technical quizzes each week.  But, you'll be pleased to know that we have indeed incorporated feedback on the quizzes, and this semester we've added questions to each quiz that cover more in-depth technical details from the *previous* lab; e.g. in the lab 4 quiz we ask some questions about lab 3 topics that we couldn't in the lab 3 quiz because students hadn't done the relevant work yet.  Hopefully it's encouraging students to pay attention to what they're doing each week instead of just following steps.

&gt; following steps

One problem is that all the steps have to be there, because even if every student could do without 80% of the steps, exactly which 20% they *do* need is going to be different for everyone.  Instead, we need ways encourage understanding even though the crutch is there, which is tough because when most students optimize their time, they're not putting a big weight on understanding.

Along those lines though, we've thought about making a ""fundamental"" version of each lab.  For lab 1, that would literally be ""Create this schematic in Quartus.  Verify its functional behavior in simulation, then download and test it on the DE2 board.""  If nothing else it would be something students could read *after* doing the lab and think ""could I do this?"" and if not, maybe it would make them consider whether or not they understood what they were doing in the lab.

&gt; re-structuring

One of our current plans is to introduce VHDL much earlier, even in lab 1.  Even though we wouldn't be able to describe much about it, it would be useful to say ""Here's a VHDL file.  See these lines?  They describe the schematic circuit you just drew, and Quartus can synthesize it into the same logic.""

They purposefully block off seats for each FASET session to ensure that freshmen have equal opportunity to register for their classes regardless of which session they attend (there is also a block for non-attending students). It sounds like the way they're doing that for those courses is by leaving the lecture open, but blocking off the labs.

If you missed your opportunity to register during the limited Phase I at FASET, you'll need to wait until Phase II.

For ECE 2020, yeah I agree with you as well. They should spend more time on digital design topics.

I also agree that they should introduce VHDL early on. I sorta remember just picking it up on the spot. Maybe talk to Brothers and see how to go about this. He is the one that teaches the special topics Verilog class. From what I heard, it was a pretty useful class.

In all honesty, the reason why I took my time to write this is that I am going to a new school and I don't feel like Georgia Tech prepared me to take more advanced digital design and VLSI courses.

However, physics can be difficult. There's a decent chance that it'll be your first exposure to a course that's noticeably harder than high school. Luckily, the tests grades are weighted so that your best test counts way more than your worst, and there are an abundance of great resources for the courses. If you feel you may struggle with 2212, taking an EAS sequence will be **much** easier, though.

Personally, I took the physics sequence. I can say with certainty that life would have been easier had I done the EAS sequence. However, my labs up until that point were CHEM 1310 and PHYS 2211, and chemistry is my least favorite science, so 2212 made more sense than taking two more EAS courses, one of which would be pointless other than satisfying the sequence requirement.

comments,"I'll preface this by saying I was a giant CPJ fan, and I was generally sad to see him go. However, it was time, and I am super excited by CGC.

In general, 5\* players are in the top 25, 4\* players are in the top 26-300, and 3\* players are in the 301-750 ranges (this varies year to year). So a 3\* player could be 301, and they could be 750. That's a broad range.

I really like 247's index, which gives players a rating out to four decimals (super scientific, definitely). This gives you a much better idea of where they are than just a star rating. 3\* players are in the 80-89 range, whereas 4\* players are in the 90-97 range.

CPJ's highest-ranked class was in 2009 at 0.8547 (7th in the ACC, 41st in the nation), and his lowest-ranked class was in 2011 at 0.8321 (9th in the ACC, 43rd in the nation). His average over 11 recruiting classes was .8436 (I'm counting 2019 in this mix, since the vast majority was his). In 2015, his class ranking was .8446 (the closest to the average), and it was 8th in the ACC, 44th in the nation. He never broke into the top 40, and he was often outside the top 50.

2020, as it stands now (there's a long way to go), has an average rating of .8617 and is #5 in the ACC, #20 nationally. That is a big improvement, but it's not earth-shattering. 

So it's also worth looking at comparative offers. Instead of competing with Duke, Western Kentucky, Troy, UAB, and other schools for recruits we're taking them away from Auburn, Ohio State, Bama, Oklahoma, LSU, and other schools with more draw. I think that's a real teller.

One thing that stood out to me is that there's a whole separate office for engagement and careers and such for CS students in addition to the GT one (C2D2 - Center for Career Discovery and Development). One of their coaches claimed that GT is the #1 source of hires for Silicon Valley. I don‚Äôt know as much about the numbers for the other colleges, but the average starting salary for CS grads in spring 2018 was $99K at GT and CS had the highest median starting salary of all majors at GT. They gave us a booklet that says there was a 95.4% offer rate and 90.1% placement rate for that cohort. Considering some 37% of CS grads stay in the Atlanta area, $99K is a really good salary even if cost of living would make a similar salary have less power in Silicon Valley etc.

That said, I think the money talks here. The market shows that it demands GT CS grads highly, and I don't think it's possible for there to be a large difference between the salaries commanded by GT CS grads based on my data and what a CMU, Stanford, MIT, etc. CS grad could earn. That's not to say they're inferior, it just seems pretty close to me. And it seems to be getting closer every year.",positive,0.9801,positive,0.09897759103641456,06/27/2019

comments,"What two majors are you planning on doing?

Basically, you have to fill out the [Undergraduate Change of Major Form](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/change-major-form-undergraduate-students) and get all the applicable signatures. However, some departments have different requirements. You should check with the advisors from both academic departments to find out all the rules and policies.

To get a 2nd undergraduate degree, you need to meet the requirements for both degrees, and must have 36 credit hours of classes for the 2nd degree that weren't used for the first degree. I double majored in EE and Math. Some of my upper level math classes counted as approved electives for EE, and some of my EE classes counted as Science/Engineering electives for Math. See [GT Catalog: Rules and Regulations XIII.F](http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/13/#seconddegree) for more information.

You can try to declare that 2nd major as soon as you like. However, most academic advisors will want you to have spent a year or two at Tech, have a decent GPA, and have taken a couple classes in their department beyond what is required for your 1st major before they'll sign the form. This is just to make sure you can handle the 2nd major. 

In particular, I recommend you start with one major, and try to take classes which can be used for both majors. After a few semesters, if you are confident that you can handle both majors, then go for it.

comments,"I understand what you're saying but my thoughts echo Loj35's. From what I recall the webpage for setting up the account only stated to use a USG email (outside of the text on the promo page). I could be misremembering but looking now only shows an inactive promo page (which states to use company info to access an exclusive employee store) so there's little further clarification unless we make the assumption that this page is the same as the original, barring the promo line. I thought the deal was a little odd but already had the account and items in cart so I read/skimmed through the terms and conditions at check out and there were no real stipulations on purchases. The only clause that stood out to me was one which stated that they could cancel orders if they suspect the abuse of a promotion/seeing a bunch of orders go to a single address. 

Sure, that's Fitbit and this is USG, but the way I see it USG didn't do their due diligence to ensure the people they were targeting were the only ones accessing their deal. The way I read the text on the promo page leads me to think it can easily be interpreted and is thus not clearly defined. For example: *If I can sign in, I can have access to the employee store?* Clearly stating that the deal is ***only*** for the USG employees would alleviate any kind of ambiguity. 

Who knows how else they could've gone about doing their due diligence but there should've been another way. For example, Georgia Southern assigns a specific email format for its employees to differentiate that account from the student account. Restricting the account creation (tied to the deal) to said email would be one decent way to do it, assuming the other USG schools do a similar thing.",negative,-0.5183,neutral,0.039880952380952385,06/28/2019

I don't think I was clear enough. Employers do this explicitly to get cheaper insurance rates and increase productivity. They pay cash out of pocket to fitbit to get these devices and run these programs. Regardless of what free things you believe you should get, there was a purpose for the program, to save USG money in the long run. Their poor execution, combined with the hopeful naivete of college students, resulted in thousands of dollars of loss to USG. That property wasn't rightly acquired by the students, and ought to be returned.

&gt; Furthermore, in order for this to make economic sense, the reduction in insurance rates would have to match or exceed the cost of the Fitbit, which I don‚Äôt see being the case. 

Again, you can see what you want to see, but the reality is that many employers are doing this, and they know the statistics and deal with Fitbit much more than any of us likely ever will.

&gt; Employees who are a bigger liability to insurance companies are generally less likely to take advantage of an offer for a free Fitbit (this is not true in all cases, but it‚Äôs accurate enough not to diminish my point), while those who are less of a liability are more likely to take advantage of a free Fitbit. 

Irrelevant, being that any candidate who reduces their risk of healthcare costs reduces those costs. The proportion might be smaller than for a higher risk candidate, but reduction is still reduction. If it saves USG $51 over the course of a year, it was a worthwhile investment. Again, I'll lean on their actual statistics, rather than your own hopeful ignorance. Don't take that as an insult, I don't know you from Adam.

Should anything ever proceed to collections you always request a debt verification letter in writing. Collection agencies must cease attempts to collect against you until they provide said letter.

Also, credit score isn't the be all end all people seem to think it is. It's important, sure, but really only if you're looking for a line of credit (house, car loan, etc).

comments,"Fitbit and USG were accepting ALL emails with an @gatech.edu domain without even bothering to verify if they were a USG employee on the USG health plan participating in a USG well-being program. Hell, even alums were getting free Fitbits using their technically deactivated GT emails just because they had email forwarding set up. *And then Fitbit shipped them to everyone.*

At **no point** during this whole process (from sign-up, to ordering, to shipping) did Fitbit bother to check if the recipients were actually eligible; either because USG didn't bother providing a list of eligible emails, or (most likely) Fitbit normally does this sort of partnership/promotion with companies so the only thing they bother to check for is a valid email domain.

The students aren't entirely without blame; there are those that ordered 2 or even 4 Fitbits, and I don't agree with those who think they're entitled to the Fitbits they received, but this is grossly incompetent on both Fitbit for enabling the whole situation in the first place and USG in their handling of notifying students. 

The best part is the students who are trying to ship their Fitbits back can't even do so by following the instructions provided to them by USG themselves. Some have gotten return labels by going through Fitbit's customer service, but even the CS reps don't know if returning them is the right move. Given USG's incompetent handling of the situation, I'm not even sure if it's safe to return the Fitbits with labels created by CS because they don't have the note requested by USG on the return authorizations. 

This whole situation **in no way** implies that students are, or even have the possibility of, getting their diplomas revoked. USG themselves didn't even threaten it, they're just saying ""pay us or return it or else we *might* send your debt to collections and deactivate your Fitbits.""",negative,-0.6956,positive,0.1742857142857143,06/28/2019

You may not like having to pay full tuition, but at least you're lucky enough to be from a family that can afford it. That's not remotely true for the majority of students.

Tech has historically been pretty bad at offering non-loan aid to low-EFC students, so it makes sense that need gets addressed first in new scholarships.

Deductive reasoning (page says employees, Ga Tech didn't send an email - they absolutely would have marketed this to students if it were for them - to everyone, nobody just gives stuff away without good reason, you didn't receive the link from an official source, but likely a friend or reddit post) would tell anyone who actually thinks more than 3 inches into the future that the program was not a free-for-all givaway.

They're taking you to collections only if you refuse to return property that isn't even yours, and that you did not rightfully receive.

comments,"Good question! 

Just for starters, no hate to club swimming as they‚Äôre by far our closest affiliated club and we throw a TON of our parties in conjunction with them.

We had a novice this year who was a triathlete and distance swimmer in high school who happened to know an athlete on the women‚Äôs team and was convinced to make the switch. For him, rowing was something new to try in college‚Äîif you‚Äôre not going d1 in the sport, the only commitment you have is to yourself, and that commitment is to pursue the activities you find the most enjoyable/fulfilling. Rowing is a little more technical than swimming as it‚Äôs a team sport as opposed to an individual, so there‚Äôs another level of difficulty added there. After years of swimming he just felt like it was time for a change of pace.

He instantly shot up the ranks of athletes in terms of raw erg scores because his fitness level was insane, especially given his cut 6‚Äô2 frame. Rowing is something you don‚Äôt really have an opportunity to do later in life unless you live near a river, and joining adult clubs with no prior experience can be daunting. He, like many other novices, decided to try it out while he had the opportunity provided to him in college.

We‚Äôre a little more disciplined than the swim team due to our level of competition, because as stated, a lot of our spring competition is against funded d1 programs. We travel a bit more. I‚Äôd argue that our practices are less monotonous, but that‚Äôs personal opinion. It‚Äôs also my opinion that rowing is way more fun as an athlete: there‚Äôs no other feeling like flying down the river at full tempo with the boat whipping under you, it‚Äôs a level of speed you just can‚Äôt hit with swimming.

Ultimately a sport is a sport. That novice fell in love with rowing and is living with 3 of the other freshmen from last year. I can put you in contact with him if you‚Äôd like to get a better idea of what his thought process was and his experience joining crew!",positive,0.9784,positive,0.1215957902496364,06/29/2019

I don't think any one of us knows an ""algorithm"" to get one. It's pure luck, skill and hard work. Career fairs, whenever companies stop by or little conferences by the COC -- all these help you understand the field you're in. First, try to get some exposure in that way, by understanding your interests and how you can pursue them. Get good grades, get involved in research if you like it. Apply for a job you're interested in.

2 - This might sound odd, but do former swimmers tend to overheat? I didn‚Äôt have much trouble when trying it out with my friends on the lake cause we were going slow and easy, but when I tried the rowing machines I got super hot pretty quickly (after 10-15 min). Is that common?

comments,"1: If it‚Äôs a fall steady state workout, we start in the 75‚Äô range and work up to 100‚Äô by the end of the year. Usually increases by 2‚Äô-3‚Äô of work per week with a constant 4-6‚Äô of rest in each session. I‚Äôd imagine 5x15‚Äô or 4x20‚Äô in the beginning of the season is reasonable! We start to get into AT work in winter which is more 5x1500m or 4x10‚Äô with much higher intensity.

2: I don‚Äôt think being a swimmer has anything to do with it. Knowing nothing about you, I‚Äôm just going to go out on a limb and say that you were probably going at too high of a stroke rate.

One of the most common misconceptions about rowing machines is that higher resistances and stroke ratings make for better workouts. For the average person, just going on the erg and yanking chain at max resistance as fast as you can for 10 minutes isn‚Äôt going to do much besides put a lot of stress on your lower back. That would be like expecting to get better at running because you sprinted a mile or two as fast as you can and called it a day.

People would benefit much more by extending the length of their pieces and dropping the rate/intensity. The goal is to stay in your aerobic zone for as long as you can at a consistent rate in order to increase your aerobic threshold day by day.

So in a roundabout answer: no. Once you join we‚Äôd help you train to your heart rate zone to make sure you‚Äôre staying at a sustainable rate and NOT overheating.",positive,0.9168,positive,0.19888888888888895,06/29/2019

Have you even read any of the other threads? The return process that USG told students to go through in their own email doesn't work at all. Students who tried to be proactive and go through Fitbit CS either are able to get a return label (with the wrong address/return authorization) or even CS is confused and doesn't know what to do. 

USG apparently responded to a few people who emailed them about this and told them to wait while they're working on fixing it, but most people who emailed USG never got a response...they have to go to Reddit of all places to read a comment from an internet stranger letting them know that USG is aware of the issue and is trying to fix it.",negative,-0.3736,neutral,0.03499149659863944,06/29/2019

comments,"It's very difficult to answer because it really does vary person to person.

First, getting all As at Tech regardless of what you do outside of studying is already pretty difficult. Going into Tech with an expectation that you'll do it isn't a good idea. It's definitely possible, especially in particularly easy semesters, but it's not exactly common and you should keep that in mind.

Now, a better way to frame the question would be to ask whether you can maintain what you'd consider acceptable academic performance while playing games 20 hours a week. But again, the answer is *maybe*. Some people study better than others, so the amount of free time you end up with may be sufficient.

However, just because you end up with enough free time to game for 20 hours doesn't mean gaming for 20 hours is feasible. Even if you maintain academic performance, that amount of gaming could still limit the time you have for socializing or interacting with clubs and the like.

I mostly studied during the week and then played for 10-12 hours a day on the weekends. It helped that almost all my classes had weekly assignments/homework due on Wednesday and Friday, so my weekends were usually free. I had chem lab on Friday, so I did the lab report on Thursday night (okay... Friday morning). If you schedule a lab class on a Monday, you'll spend the whole weekend procrastinating the lab report and feeling bad about procrastinating.

I was also extremely depressed and homesick. Would not recommend playing 10-12 hours a day. Sitting in the corner of the dorm study lounge and playing Project64 or Skyrim on your laptop is not ""being social."" Make friends. Talk to people. Play games together. Don't be dumb like me.

 If you want to actually get A's, my advice is focus on getting all your school work done ASAP and then use the remaining time for gaming or whatever else you choose (like maybe a gaming club or other extracurricular).

That way, you don't have to worry about falling behind quite as much, and if something changes or randomly gets assigned, you won't be scrambling to finish a butt load of work at the last minute. You could potentially spend monday-wednesday/thursday doing nothing but school work, then you'd have all of Friday-Sunday to do whatever you want.

comments,"It's probably possible, but definitely do consider trying some new stuff, especially your first semester! College is a pretty different world from high school and the opportunities might surprise you. I used to play games on the daily but I ended up hardly ever playing during the school year because there's so much to do. Plus, there's plenty of gamers on campus, but you have to find them first!",positive,0.9605,positive,0.08997474747474747,06/30/2019

I know this doesn't necessarily answer your question, but I'd advise this to all incoming majors :)",positive,0.948,positive,0.14401041666666664,06/30/2019

comments,"Bruh no where in the process of ordering did it say it was only for a specific group of people. It just said something like ‚Äúthe university system of Georgia is paying for you to get a free Fitbit!‚Äù I assumed it was a promotion for students since I had gotten the link, and could access it with my email. Clearly, this was the general assumption. There should have been more security if they wanted it to only be for a specific sect of people with USG emails

Do not put this on the students and go cry yourself your own fucking river",positive,0.7339,positive,0.11499999999999999,06/30/2019

comments,"Nah, I was saying my brother was lucky, thinking that you had to be a graduate to get the conditional, because you said OPs brother hadn‚Äôt matriculated yet, and since I assumed he went to tech for undergrad to continue here for his masters, matriculating into the master program equated to graduating undergrad. 

Which, I thought because that‚Äôs what I did, and my brother just applied and got the conditional transfer option. So I was saying he was lucky, because if it required to be a graduate, then he made it just in time given I did so months prior to his application. My assumption was wrong though, as the brother doesn‚Äôt seem to be a current tech student, so it lines up with what you said. 

I also didn‚Äôt know conditional transfer was limited only to family members to begin with, my mom had said something to that effect, but then again she‚Äôs also been kinda like one of those ‚Äúhe should have gotten in‚Äù parents so I wasn‚Äôt sure how much that was true, and how much was her saying the application process is unfair now or something to that effect.",positive,0.703,positive,0.07043650793650792,06/30/2019
