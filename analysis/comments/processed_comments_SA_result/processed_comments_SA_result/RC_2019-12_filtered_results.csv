comments,"Dude, I recommend chilling out a bit.  As such, we hope you join us on Monday for some laughs. After over a quarter of a century at GT, I believe this is exactly the overly-analytical approach we faculty impose on the students. I blame myself and my colleagues for this. We can't fix decades of this in the classroom, but we can laugh about it on Monday night.

A. While CTCA is not a perfect organization, Dr. Katherine Puckett was previously the head of their Mind-Body Medicine Division and did some amazing work in the use of humor to reduce stress for cancer patients. They are a commercial business and as such they sometimes paint their success rates in an overly-positive light, just as Georgia Tech used to downplay information about mental health challenges (long before your time). Luckily GT is more open about this now and trying more proactive things to address it. We comedians are trying to join them to do our part regardless of how indirect the effects may be.

B. [www.humor.gatech.edu](https://www.humor.gatech.edu)  points to [http://pwp.gatech.edu/humor/](http://pwp.gatech.edu/humor/) specifically. Check your browser settings.

C. Nobody is pretending that mental health can be ""Attacked"" by humor (interesting choice of words that were not actually used in the original post). If you don't think humor might help improve your mood before finals, then I recommend the late night pancake breakfast or some other activities that GT usually does at the end of the semester.

We hope you can join us on Monday night, and I look forward to meeting you in person. Feel free to stay after the show to discuss research in stress reduction from humor, and possibly join the new Stand-up Comedy Club at GT.",positive,0.9969,positive,0.08344988344988344,11/30/2019

You have like 6 high quality RBs on the roster. You should be in the diamond or split back like 60ish percent of the time. Who gives a shit if 4 WRs get to play when none of them get targets or catches. It was like they were calling plays to signal to recruits ""we're serious about teaching you NFL concepts!

I've been saying since the start of the year, we traded a moderate recruiter/developer and possibly the nation's best gameday coaches for a good-to-great recruiter/developer and bad gameday coach.

So I don't think you would be able to switch to Psychology. However it is always worth reaching out to the department advisor because it MIGHT be possible depending on circumstances.

What is your current program, and what are you interested in? 

There is also a great (nationally recognized) masters in Human-Computer Interaction, which is an interdisciplinary program under Psychology and a couple other schools.

Based on your post history, it looks like you are considering psychology just to get out of your current masters program, and not because of a deep interest in psychology.

comments,"I'm confident in CGC, but...

What do we do about Patenaude? How do we judge a guy who came in and failed to accomplish a monumentally difficult task? He was asked to turn an option team into a modern offense, which hasn't been done before at this level in this era of football. Our offensive line was recruited and coached to play triple option football, and they had the rug pulled out from under them with the scheme change. I don't think we'd have won 6 games this season with Urban Meyer as our Offensive Coordinator.

But our first play of our 10th game of the season, we took a delay of game because the offense had no idea what they were doing. That shouldn't be happening past the first game, if at all. Playcalling has ranged from bad to mediocre. He wasn't great at Temple and their fans seemed generally happy to see him go. 

I don't know whether firing him will improve things. I don't know that a replacement could do any better. But I hope CGC and Stansbury are figuring those things out, and if he's still here next year, I damn well hope there's meaningful improvement.",positive,0.9405,neutral,0.008333333333333352,12/01/2019

comments,"In my experience, it depends on what you mean by ""do things get better."" If you want to maintain a 4.0, and that's your primary goal at GT, then no, things likely won't ""get better"" because classes can and will get harder and you'll find yourself slaving away over every last point. 

If, on the other hand, your goal is to have fun, build up a marketable skillset, and learn what you can, then yes, things can and should ""get better"" because the focus is no longer about the number on your transcript. You're focused on learning, and when you feel you've put in a good effort for the day you can feel free to enjoy some time for your other interests. Remember, there's a point of diminishing return where to reliably expect another point on the exam you'll have to spend exponentially more time studying. Don't cross that point; it'll drive you insane for no good reason. As long as you develop the skills a particular class is concerned with, you'll at minimum do fine on any graded assignment. In my experience, building skills as you go also helps you get more efficient with dealing with later, harder classes as well.

At the end of the day, yes GT is hard, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to both do well AND have a good time. It's ok to ""not do as well"" in a class gradewise; the important thing is to develop skills, not memorize stuff that you'll be able to look up at will later anyway.",positive,0.9803,positive,0.12343749999999999,12/02/2019

Both of these are going to be really crowded though and I suggest looking at the list of companies attending (not sure if it's out) so that you can get a good idea of who all are there. I also recommend applying online to those companies and reading about them instead of encountering them for the first time in the wild, makes a good first impression.

comments,"EEs are pretty in demand to any AE lab, at least from what I've seen, so I'm sure you would be welcome in a lot of AE labs! Unfortunately, sometimes professors can get too busy to answer emails, or those emails may get lost. Also, a lot of projects are software-based, so you might have better luck in hardware-based labs. Here's a rough list of labs I know who recruit EE's:

Dr. Glenn Lightsey ([glenn.lightsey@gatech.edu](mailto:glenn.lightsey@gatech.edu)) deals with Cubesat/SSDL projects and is very responsive to emails, I'm sure if you told him your interests he would be able to find a project that fits your needs. There are a lot of electronics that go into cubesats and what his lab does

Dr. Brian Gunther ([brian.gunter@aerospace.gatech.edu](mailto:brian.gunter@aerospace.gatech.edu)) also deals with Cubesat/SSDL. Iirc His work is more cubesat-focused and he mostly employs grad students. He's a little less responsive but I'd be happy to hook you up with a grad student on his team if needed

Dr. Carl C. Johnson ([cj124@mail.gatech.edu](mailto:cj124@mail.gatech.edu)) heads the Design Build Fly team where students design airplanes to fly at competition; the electronics on the planes mean we are always in need for EE's

Dr. Mitchell L. R. Walker([mitchell.walker@ae.gatech.edu](mailto:mitchell.walker@ae.gatech.edu)) heads the High-Power Electric Propulsion Laboratory (HPEPL) down in NARA if electric propulsion is your cup of tea

Dr. Eric Feron ([eric.feron@aerospace.gatech.edu](mailto:eric.feron@aerospace.gatech.edu)) headed a research project having to do with controls and fail-safes on electronic functions in a plane. I don't know too much about his lab but I'm sure he'd be happy to give you specifics

Also the bigger question, do you only interact with people in your class? It’s not like NREs are isolated to partners in their own major.

I was overall slightly surprised by the NRE results. I’d be surprised to learn that more than two or three people in the 2020 class *aren’t* getting it.",positive,0.7848,positive,0.1375,12/02/2019

comments,"Hey! I definitely get where you are now because I was so confused when trying to join ORGT. Basically, ORGT is a conglomerate of many outdoor sports, like Rock Climbing, Backpacking, White Water Kayaking, etc., and when you ""join"" ORGT, you are really becoming a staff member in a specific sport. For most sports, to become an instructor in training, you need to do the Instructional Program (IP) trip progression for that sport, i.e. Beginner Trip -&gt; Advanced Trip. Spots for IP trips open up a month before the trip goes out, and you can sign up for these trips at the Wilderness Outpost in the CRC. It's in the back of the CRC, and it's open Mon-Thurs 2-7pm and Fri 2-5pm.

If you are really interested in becoming staff, I also highly recommend attending the weekly meetings for sports you are interested in. Each sport has a different meeting day + time, so I recommend checking out the Outpost for meeting times. Some of the meeting info is only relevant to staff, but anyone is welcome, and it's a great way to get to know people, learn more about ORGT, and gain info about trainings that are open to everyone.

I hope that helped! Feel free to DM me if you have any more questions. The Wilderness Outpost is also a good place to go if you want some more info.",positive,0.9898,positive,0.27538461538461545,12/03/2019

It's possible but the question is will the HR do that for you? Or is it easier for them to revoke your offer and find another candidate who can work in the spring? Those are the real questions that you need to think about.",positive,0.6199,neutral,0.014393939393939395,12/04/2019

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Aware Home was designed with two identical floors, each featuring: a kitchen, dining room, living room, 3 bedrooms, 2 full bathrooms, and a laundry room. But it was also designed with many features not found in a typical home in order to support the expected research to be conducted. These features include:

* a basement with a conference room and workshop
* an attic with walk-in access
* accessible features, like grab bars and wider hallways and doors, and lever door handles
* conduits from basement to attic, with breakouts for each main floor
* drop ceilings with outlets, cable trays, and conduits concealed in the space above
* conduits running from ceiling to floor, allowing concealment of custom runs of cables
* indirect and diffuse lighting to avoid specular reflection to optimize computer vision results

&gt;The home was originally intended to allow for a full-time resident(s) / research participants on one floor and prototyping of new technologies, sensing, and other research on the other floor. For a number of reasons (including legal), this intended use by long-term residents has not yet been realized; however, the facility is very useful for studies involving live-in participants for a short-term (e.g. 1-10 days).

Basically it meets everything you want and I suppose they'll be fine with you guys using it since there's no regular tenant.",positive,0.9441,positive,0.17017825311942958,12/04/2019

Section C

The assignment of academic standing is based on both the student's most recent academic term and their cumulative grade-point average.

The minimum satisfactory grade-point average (GPA) is 2.70 for master's.

**Academic warning**

Academic warning is a subcategory of good academic standing, differing only in the maximum allowable schedule load.

A student who has a cumulative grade-point average below the minimum satisfactory scholarship requirement, or whose cumulative grade-point average for work taken during any term is below this requirement, shall be placed on academic warning.

A student on academic warning whose grade-point average for the academic term is above the minimum satisfactory scholarship requirement and cumulative grade-point average is below the minimum satisfactory scholarship requirement shall remain on academic warning.

**Academic probation**

A student on academic warning whose grade-point average is below the minimum satisfactory scholarship requirement for any academic term shall be placed on academic probation.

An undergraduate student in good academic standing whose grade-point average for any academic term is below 1.00, based on at least six graded hours, shall be placed on academic probation.

A student also may be placed on academic probation through other actions, as described in the following section.

**Dismissal for unsatisfactory scholarship**

A student on academic probation whose grade-point average for the academic term of probation is below the minimum satisfactory scholarship requirement and whose cumulative grade-point average is below the minimum satisfactory scholarship requirement shall be dropped from the rolls for unsatisfactory scholarship.",positive,0.8834,neutral,-0.0006578947368421116,12/04/2019

To prove trademark infringement, you need to prove that there's some likelihood that people will confuse your goods/services as being officially associated with the owner of the trademark. That's clearly not the case here. Re: libel, you have to allege a provably false statement of fact. A Tech player did, in fact, make contact with his camera equipment at high speed, destroying it. For the purposes of libel law, his analysis of who is culpable is a matter of opinion, and thus cannot form the basis of a libel claim. If he claimed Swilling  \*deliberately\* destroyed the equipment (which he isn't), that could be a provably false statement of fact. Also, libel law weighs context heavily.

He changed the wording when I pointed out he was libeling Swilling and forwarded a copy of the video showing the camera being hit by Swilling’s shoulder, as he was being drug and thrown into the wall by the UGA player.

If this man had done the right thing, he would have titled his gofundme, “I’m irresponsible and didn’t have my equipment insured so everyone give me your hard earned money”!  

This man claims to be a professional photographer of 40 years.  He knows when he is given the privilege of a media pass there are risks of being on the sidelines and that includes being injured or having your equipment broken.  He assumed that risk when he stepped on the field.

More disturbing was this man’s violent, unprofessional behavior in the media room directly after the incident.  The man should be banned from ever stepping foot on the field at Bobby Dodd Stadium again.

His gofundme me and his claims his camera was “willfully” destroyed are ridiculous.  He was the only irresponsible person.  Insurance for camera equipment is very cheap.

I don’t have a problem with him asking people for help although I would be embarrassed if I had been that irresponsible.

comments,"***********
I already commented on this article but I felt that it's important to let my friends and family know my experience with this photographer. I am not here to fight on which school is better, but this article and this man's GoFundMe page really bothered me after the experience I had in the media room with him, immediately after the incident. So here goes: As a photographer who was in the media room when this man came back inside after the fight, I would like to comment on the ridiculousness of not only his GoFundMe page, but this article as a whole. I am a Georgia Tech student who photographs for a student publication and I had taken a break during the third quarter to get water from the media workroom. Suddenly, a very angry photographer marched into the room, cursing violently about his camera getting broken. It turned out to be this man. I quickly began texting messages to our publication's sports Slack channel about him because I was honestly very shocked and scared at his behavior. It was clear from his comments about those “fucking a$$holes! Cant even play fucking division one football” among others, that he was associated with the UGA football team. In his tirade he slammed his equipment down on the table, probably damaging it even worse than it was. For this point alone I believe that Georgia Tech should consider talking to the security guard working right outside of the media room, as well as the student intern who witnessed this event with me before taking any actions toward considering helping him replace his camera. Don’t get me wrong, I would be upset too if my $6,000 lens was broken, but that’s the risk we photographers take by accepting the on field press pass. I fully believe that his incredibly unprofessional reaction should be evaluated by Georgia Tech before he is invited back to our stadium to shoot on the field again. I will reiterate that I was legitimately scared as he seemingly grew angrier and released more expletives over his broken equipment. As someone who has done this for over 40 years, he should know how to act within a professional workroom environment. Further on, as this ludicrous article states his “GoFundMe page is playfully labeled ‘Tech Wrecked My Camera Gear.’” There is nothing playful about wrongfully blaming one side of the fight. Within his GoFundMe description it states that “Swilling took a swing, knocking my camera and lens to the ground” which, if you look at other angles of the fight, such as the video embedded in the article, you can clearly see that the camera was not knocked out of this man’s hands by a swing from Swilling, but rather it seems that Swilling’s shoulder knocked it out while he was literally being thrown into the wall by Pickens. If his media room reaction wasn’t bad, I would at least consider the wrongful blame he puts on Georgia Tech and Swilling as being responsible for knocking his camera out of his hands, when in reality Pickens was also a major factor in the fight that caused this tragic photographic incident. I am severely disappointed in the reporting and clear bias of this article, but after researching the author it is clear why this is present considering he has been contributing AJC articles about the Georgia Bulldogs for many years. I am sad that WSB-TV felt the need to share this needless article that adds nothing notable to the hate week coverage and only serves to further vilify Georgia Tech as the bad guys, when in reality the fight was the fault of both teams. This bad guy theme is further developed by the author saying “The melee — specifically, Swilling's elbow — snapped McIntyre's lens and broke his Nikon D500 camera in half.” The reporting overall is lack luster. I am glad to see that the majority of the comments are in agreement with me that this seasoned professional didn’t take the professional route of things. Although I am definitely sympathetic that this photographer was caught up in such a violent “me-lee”, his reaction to the incident was completely uncalled for and he continues to put the blame on Georgia Tech and Tre Swilling in a deceptive attempt to shift the attention away from their beloved Georgia player who’s teammates have been quoted saying that this is a step for him to “grow up” (https://www.dawgnation.com/football/georgia-uga-pickens-george-apologize). If you made it all the way to the end of this, thank you for hearing out my side of this situation as someone who experienced first hand this photographer’s unprofessional, and frankly, terrifying behavior after this incident. I hope that WSB-TV, as well as the AJC, will reconsider their coverage of this incident and take better steps towards considering what stories are really worth bringing to the public and avoid bringing biased pieces to the internet to further put blame on one single side when that is not at all the case. Thank you.",negative,-0.996,negative,-0.06590004600874169,12/05/2019

He knew how stupid he looked holding a couple grand of busted equipment with no recourse (see the photo in the AJC article of him holding his broken camera so that a real photographer could get a shot of it), and like any man who's weekend consists of barks and grunts - he acted out in anger.

Yeah, I'm petty about this, and I have my reasons - for example - I was once an expert witness, the judge stated he was a UGA alumus, questioned my credentials (to his surprise I produced my degree card), and in his closing remarks saw fit to inform everyone of his personal opinions about Georgia Tech, from the bench, on court record.

Edit: After seeing OP’s PRC ID card I’m totally convinced now.

我怀疑楼主所述内容的真实性——

I suspect this post is untrue.

1. 除非楼主是新疆人，否则即使回国也不应该被送到再教育营。以寻衅滋事等罪名羁押于当地看守所是更有可能的情形。
2. 我从未听说过因支持香港游行而被冻结银行账户的报告。
3. 语言细节上，我认为楼主并非中国人。我从未见过中文母语者以 ”Propaganda Kingdom” 称呼中国，或以 “共产主义者” 称呼支持中共的人。这些都是典型的西方视角的称号。

Translated:

1. Unless OP is from Xinjiang, he/she won’t be sent back to a “reeducation camp” even if the party decided he/she is harmful. I also described a technically more likely situation of detention but I don’t want to translate it for OP.
2. I’ve never heard of bank account suspension as a method to punish HK supporters.
3. I believe OP is not native Chinese according to language details. We won’t call a CCP-supporter “communist” under any context. No one use that title. Remember, in Chinese, calling anyone “communist” is a praise, a title given by CCP to those high-rank officials. We won’t call China “Propaganda Kingdom”. This is purely western way of thinking. I have a million bad names for calling CCP-ruled China but not this one.

如果楼主是中国人，请解释下兲朝和天朝这两个称呼的不同。If OP is Chinese, please explain the difference between the name 天朝 and 兲朝.

如果楼主是中国内地人士，又支持香港，想必知道 TG 一词在两地的不同意思吧。

It's not really available to be turned in late with no penalty; it's just due on Dec 12th, so I don't think that's quite an excuse for the professor.  He claims it's our replacement final, so I feel like it's intended to be a bit above and beyond normal coursework.

Regarding the last sentence of 12.D.1, the replacement should have to be listed on the syllabus and announced during the first day of class.

 I couldn’t even copy from my own notes cause I couldn’t focus more than 30 secs.

And you might just be thinking too much about the problems you messed up on; we tend to concentrate and worry more about what we don’t know than remember what we did because we spent more time and effort on the difficult problems. So don’t worry! And even if you have to retake the class, that’s okay! Just keep your head up and keep moving. It’s good to be focused on school but also good to have a healthy social life!

Last time I checked (or well was notified) I didn’t get CIOS back until after final grades

Also word of the wise: I made a mistake freshman year of college at Not GT and wrote a bad review about a professor in a 2 person class. I thought that admins read them not the prof and continued on how incompetent the professor was because I learned nothing I didn’t already know, she was soft spoken thick accent, obv didn’t know how to teach the material, etc etc etc. I still don’t know what she thought of that review but no way she didn’t know it was me.

comments,"&gt;personal attacks on trump

Please show me exactly where I assigned any Direct attack at Trump, it almost as though you like having your tax money spent on never-ending wars,

&amp;#x200B;

Heres some, painfully topical, analysis that likely was willfully(?) ignored. Trump's appointment of Betsy DeVos and her subsequent reduction in funding PUBLIC teaching institutions (like the school you got in for being...**analytical**?). 

Then you have the gall to call me unaware, after having worked with Morgan Stanley and seeing a marked increase in deal-flow since Tiny Hands was elected, concurrent to his tax skullfuckery a torrid, unsustainable, increase in the DJIA and SPX - especially after analyzing executive payment packages and realizing that theyre paid in stock options **of their own company**, But those executives control where the 'tax cuts' are allocated so the executives buy back the stock of their own company, thus inflating their compensation by not exercising stock options until AFTER the tax ""cuts"" are allocated within the structure.

You're right though, im completely unaware of the motivations of those pervertedly capital-seeking dipshits. Hey, im glad that you've seen a 25+% increase per annum in your net worth since 2016, thats completely sustainable. Especially considering the instability stoked by the current FED rates so companies can take out more debt.

If you have background in music and DSP, then it would be easy to catch up with contents in computational music or music informatics in music tech.

Think about it: why would there be a whole ME career fair in the spring if there were no opportunities left?

And even if the internship search doesn't work out, no worries! You could always study abroad, take some classes at GT or another university and transfer them, or even just work a side gig and get some cash. And I'm not 100% sure if you can do this for ME, but when I didn't get an internship after my sophomore year, I spent this past summer working on a personal project that became a great talking point in my interviews this semester.

comments,"Adding some thoughts from the other side of the fence:

* The way that CIOS is used varies between departments and courses and instructors...but they are used. That includes things like evaluating textbooks, data that can be used to support requests for different classrooms in the future, etc. They are NOT ***just*** used to evaluate instructors.

* I can't get into details, but the administration DOES look at them and DOES act based on them. I know of several cases. The scores are **ALSO** used as part of the process of giving teaching awards...so only filling out CIOS for the instructors/courses you hate actually can hurt instructors/courses you really enjoy.

* The most practically helpful things are concrete areas of complaint along with suggestions for improvement. The second obviously is a shared responsibility but it helps your concerns be taken seriously and reacted too. Knowing that students see a problem may leave a faculty member scrambling for a solution that students actually accept/like/find better. Having ideas for changes in student voice are meaningful because they give insight about how y'all experience/would like to experience courses.

* Unlike what the other person said...I don't know any professors who would change the curve based 

* Remember that who wrote what is [*confidential* but not *anonymous*](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/confidentiality-vs-anonymity/). If you write something threatening or truly offensive the vendor can identify you, so please don't. Be a professional like you will when you graduate and takeover the world.

* Enough students have commented on my poor personal style that I am well aware it is lacking. No, I'm not changing it. No I haven't been tested for color blindness, why do you ask?

We understand that sometimes CIOS can be a place to vent...but it is one of the ways that we all communicate about classes so the best way we can all use it is by taking it seriously and earnestly. I understand, and have as a student, written 'cathartic' CIOS comments...but in the long run it isn't a lasting high.",positive,0.965,neutral,0.039047619047619046,12/08/2019

That said, if an intern reneges an offer, the company may go back to the pool of candidates (very unlikely). It is important to send weekly follow-up emails to the recruiter and/or hiring manager to always know where you are in the process.

All of the above was for the fall hiring season. Large companies still come around in Spring because they weren't able to fill up positions in Fall or they have a new batch of positions to fill. Small companies also tend to come around en masse during Spring. So worry not if you didn't find an internship during Fall. Put as much effort as you can during the Winter Break and in Spring.

For my masters program, the majority of students didn't have internships scheduled until March-April.

So don't worry, just keep at it. And if you don't happen to get lucky, it's fairly easy to find/do research over the summer.

comments,"If you’re worried about not getting the credit you really shouldn’t be: as a math major this class still only counts as a free elective, which you need 11 credits in to graduate. I’m pretty sure most math majors end up with far more than that. And if you do need that credit, you are free to take the class again next year. So not a problem there except some repeated work.

You may also be sad that you missed taking the Putnam, as you likely took the class since you’re interested in that sort of thing. Again I wouldn’t worry too much because you can take the Putnam every year you are an undergraduate whether or not you take the class. I highly encourage this. I’d be quite mad at myself if I missed the Putnam so I kind of understand if that’s the issue. If you still want to “take” it this year I can send you the link to a website where the problems will be uploaded later today. Of course you will not get it graded officially (many people, such as me, think they got a problem right but really lose points on it).

If you’re worried about getting a fail on your transcript, perhaps you could reply to the professor again, say you will do the final paper by the deadline he gave and you just forgot the test, and ask if you could be “withdrawn” from the class instead of failed. And does freshman forgiveness work on pass/fail classes? Maybe the fail will disappear if you take it again next year.

I understand how massively frustrating it must have been to just have forgotten to go to a thing. But ultimately this shouldn’t have big consequences. Just get it worked out now to your satisfaction (take the exam and/or email the prof again) and then try to move on.",negative,-0.9692,positive,0.0672004608294931,12/09/2019

comments,"A piece of advice from someone that has a broader perspective and a formal education as an engineer:

I am of the very serious opinion that anyone that gets involved in politics or social sciences must have an engineering background. Specifically in systems and feedback theory. Everything, without exception, is a dynamical system. Everything is a complex system. Everything has chaos and chaotic attractors at its root.

Most of the problems in society, economics, and politics would be avoided if politicians and economists had to take at least a couple of experimental classes in dynamical systems and feedback theory. Where they can clearly see the effects of system shocks, delays, and feedback changes. Where they could witness emergence and chaos firsthand. 

The more i study philosophy, linguistics, and politics, the more convinced I am of this fact.

Even philosophy can be strongly formalized if you incorporate mathematics into it. There is the whole little-known field of [Mathematical Philosophy](http://m-phi.blogspot.com/2013/03/what-is-mathematical-philosophy-1.html) (not to be confused with Bertran Russel's book of the same name, which is in the philosophy of mathematics).

In the social sciences  there is a field called [Social Systems Theory](https://www.britannica.com/topic/systems-theory), which is the application of  basic engineering principles to complex human systems. Don't see engineering as a separate narrow field, with the right perspective you can see its wide applicability to absolutely everything in society.",negative,-0.9353,neutral,0.03850931677018634,12/09/2019

comments,"I always enjoyed math, but it's primary purpose for me was a means to an end: to become an engineer. It sucks that your internship turned out like that; it seems like the company could have put you in a better position to ensure your interest and engagement. The places I've worked at moved interns around to give them a better idea of the entire scope of opportunities that were available in the company. Yeah, I've had to work some pretty ""drab"" contract jobs throughout my career, but over the 30+ years I've worked, I've also had quite a few ""holy shit, this is cool!"" type of jobs that reaffirmed why I became an engineer. There were times we worked on things that made us question whether they were even possible to achieve. Sometimes there were breakthroughs, other times not.

You need to do something that makes you happy though, so good on you for figuring that out early enough.

My daughter had a full scholarship ride through pre-med on the way to (she hoped) become a neurosurgeon. After a year she figured out she was going down that path to please others, not because it was what she wanted to do. She switched to digital media and got her bachelor's degree and worked on her master's, but realized it was her portfolio that made her shine, so she left a semester short of that. She has done quite a bit of concept art and married those to wireframe models for animations (this part may be incorrect since I know little or nothing about that business), and has done a lot of coding, a lot more than she imagined she would, so of course I needle her with the ""nerd"" moniker. She has worked at large companies (she termed Microsoft ""the evil overlords"") and at small indie(?) companies on a number of different projects. She enjoys her work, but also has hobbies on the side, like helping out at a working farm and growing her own food.

False.

You altogether missed the point I made.

Understanding systems engineering at a fundamental level gives you unparalleled insight in the workings of social systems. That includes language, philosophy, politics, economy, and everything else. I am talking about qualitative insights not quantitative ones.

That it also allows you to put hard numbers forward and make those insights quantitative and formally provable, so you can pursue a PhD, is just gravy.",negative,-0.4194,neutral,-0.0382936507936508,12/09/2019

Is the reason why we had to introduced behavioral economics because standard economics doesn’t work always work in reality. The reason we  now use fractal geometry is because Euclidean geometry  only helps in simplified models just like Newton’s laws that brakes down when dealing with the 3 body problem.  There are a lot of fields that come together to explain Complex Systems like graph theory, cybernetics, mathematics... a shit tone of them.  social sciences also makes use  of a lot of these tools for modeling purposes

That’s not the answer you wanna hear. However, it’s the answer I needed to hear last Spring.

However, you’re gonna be okay. 

If you fail the class, so what? You’ll just take it again. Georgia Tech just changed the rule for grade substitution, so if you need to, worse comes to worse you take the class a second time and you kill it and the old grade is essentially erased. 

You’re also not alone. We’re all stuck in this mindset because we’re here that everyone around us is making A’s and killing all their classes, and that we’re the only one struggling. There are probably people in your section who needed a 99 to pass and are probably sweating bullets right now. Odds are you at minimum passed. 

Just relax, finals season is the worst time of the year for most, if not all, students. 

If you’re still worried, email your professor. If you’re homework grade/any other grades attached to recitation are good, you can tell him you’ve put in the work and just need a little help.

comments,"Had something like this happen to me when I was as Tech.   
Posting of the finals schedule was poorly organized and I was a new transfer unfamiliar with where to find the info if it wasn't on T-square.   
Emailed the prof the weekend before finals week saying ""I'm having a hard time finding the finals schedule. The final is scheduled for XX:YY PM on Thursday, correct?""   
To which he responded ""That is correct"".     
Showed up for the exam on Thursday and didn't recognize any of the students. Tracked down a posted hard copy of the schedule for all Math finals in Skiles....Final had been on Tuesday.    

At first he wouldn't let me make it up, but I showed him his email (forwarded it to multiple other personal accounts just in case) and told him I'd take it to the Dean if I had to.    
He let me make it up, but not till after Christmas break. At which point, my grade went from an ""F"" to an ""A"" (critical pre-req I needed for most of my spring classes btw).    
Walked with him to be sure he submitted the change. The woman at the desk saw the grade change and looked at us like I'd just performed unspeakable acts to get an ""A"".

Mine are mostly about forgetting about a class that I registered, and now it's the end of the semester and I haven't been to a single lecture.  It's probably because when I was at Tech I would sometimes remove a class during the first week drop period, so my subconscious thinks that it is a class that I never finished.

Then there's the recurring dream about still needing one more class to graduate.  I think this one is because graduation date was before class grades were made final, so you didn't know if you've truly graduated until a week later (or maybe that was high school, it's been so long it's hard to remember).

Everyone says that it's important to know how to write... and I feel like we do a good job of reinforcing that (2010's grade makeup relies on having a solid policy memo), but you can easily go the route of statistician/data analytics if you choose to do so.

They have an online course website so you can check out the syllabus and the weekly readings, etc. Exams were rough but if you keep up with the content, you should do fine. I personally found the content to be very interesting and a good foundation for future bio classes.

Assuming I get above a 75 on the final I will have an A in the class. The tests were difficult but fortunately the class is out of 105 points and each test is out of 105 points as well, making it easier to achieve an A. There are some heavy readings and homeworks, but as long as you stay on top of them it’s not very bad, and it assures you 20 points towards you grade (which is better than 10 HW points in most classes).

comments,"I've experienced:

* Arium Westside. Lived there for a summer on 5th floor. No big red flags (like pests, mold, really old appliances) popped up, everything was perfectly tolerable.
* Westmar. Currently living here. It's not that bad; there's a reputation for sketchiness but that hasn't manifested itself yet. Biggest problem is the location, I use a bicycle daily to get to school and work and I couldn't survive without it, or without relying on my roommate's car for groceries. Walking time to the CULC is \~40 minutes. The Westmar shuttle bus is pretty reliable (my roommate takes it regularly) but only comes once an hour, and stops after 10pm (i think) most weekdays so you're out of luck if you're doing, for example, a late-night study session at the CULC. We also have appliance issues with our fridge, constantly leaking water on the inside, but maintenance is surprisingly quick (1-3 days?) at responding to requests. Westmar is pretty cheap compared to other locations, which is the main reason I picked it. Since I'm on the eighth floor I don't get much pest problems and I never hear the train; your situation might be different on a lower floor.
* UHouse. Haven't lived here but have a friend who does. A lot of people say it's far, but its distance to the CULC is comparable to North Ave Apartments's (on-campus apts). The amenities and rooms are decent, some people have reported pest problems though so I'd go with a higher floor to try to avoid those. It's across the street from Publix, I'd image this would make groceries super convenient.

I haven't had any sketchy stuff happen yet, I'm a dude though so your mileage may vary. DM me if you have more questions about Arium Westside or Westmar?",positive,0.9214,positive,0.18100000000000002,12/10/2019

comments,"there are faculty who target a certain exam average. Why I don't really know. Nominally, exams are a form of summative assessment and should just test the things covered in class. If exam grades are catestrophically bad that speaks more to a failure of the instructor than the students. It is either that the entire class does not know/understand key concepts or the test is not well aligned to measure knowledge/understanding of those key concepts.

If you take a computer adaptive test (like the GRE) that automatically selects more or less difficult questions based on how well you they actually target that the person should get 2/3 of questions right. It would be more efficient to target the person getting 50% right. However, in testing they found it demotivational to do that poorly AND the same people ended up with lower scores.",negative,-0.8475,neutral,0.014021164021164026,12/11/2019

This leaves a lot of wiggle room, obviously.  Some profs take it to extremes and make tests that kick everyone's ass.

comments,"My first EE class in Fall quarter (yes, I am that old) of \~1980 used the text ""Fundamentals of Circuits, Electronics, and Signal Analysis"" written by Dr. Su, and the professor for our class was Dr. Moad. I went into the final with a reasonably solid B. When I went to his office to pick up my exam, I dug through the pile on the floor outside of his office and found it with a 60-something grade. My first thought was ""Eff, I dropped to a C grade"".

I decided I needed to know what I did wrong, because this was the basic class for everything that followed, so I gathered myself up, knocked on his office door and asked him how to correct what I had missed. After a half an hour or so of questions/answers, I asked him about my final grade for the course, and he said WTTE of ""You got an A. You had the highest grade on the final exam."" As far as I remember, this was one of the high points of my time at Tech regarding academics, at least until I got out and was congratulated by one of my favorite teachers, Dr. Uyemura, in the melee after graduating.

comments,"TL:DR - the GRE/SAT is for ranking people and your comment is relevant but incomplete. Assessments in courses should not serve a primarily ranking function and do not need imperfect scores to assess mastery of learning objectives.

---------------

So I get where you are going...but this is not correct in terms of modern thinking about testing and assessment in classrooms. It also isn't really a correct explanation of testing theory - it's kind of a half explanation of the potential issues around ceiling effects in educational assessment. 

In course summative assessment (i.e., tests) really does not (should not?) serve a ranking purpose and is not necessarily served best by eliminating ceiling effects. For those not in the know, a ceiling afect is when someone does so well on a test that you can't really assign them a score. That could mean getting all the questions right, or it could mean getting all of the difficult questions right...maybe even if you weren't paying attention and missed a really easy one. The concept draws from latent construct measurement theory in social sciences. Example: you can't score higher than 1600 on the SATs...but multiple people score 1600 every year.

If your goal is an accurate comparative determination of score and relative ranking, then having questions at a difficulty level above the top most score ensures that you can accurately score a student. If I want to rank students, sure, having a question no one or maybe one person gets right adds information to my statistical model.

If your goal is assessment of specific student learning, then the questions should be grounded in standards - e.g., learning objectives or other generally accepted markers of knowledge on the topic area. The test isn't performing a ranking function it's performing a mastery assessment function. In that case, there is no purpose in a relative assessment. Having questions you know all students will get wrong doesn't serve any purpose - you want the questions to assess key material, not material beyond students comprehension or what was covered in class. It adds no information to whether students have learned the material the course expects of them.

In the end, what this really draws back to is what is grade. If a course covers certain material and students can all accurately demonstrate mastery of the learning objectives, everyone getting a perfect score is perfectly rational - albeit unlikely. If a course, instead, treats a grade as a relative ranking...yeah sure put questions harder than anyone can do on the test...but education left you behind like 50 years ago.

comments,"All you can do is keep chugging forward my dude. Life can beat the shit out of you, and you've just gotta take it on the chin and move onwards with the new lessons in mind.

To be a bit more concrete, some general tips that you can try and put to use.

One, take some time to yourself for the next couple of weeks, and always set aside time for yourself from here on out. A perfect homework score means nothing if you hate your life and burn out halfway through your degree.

Two, focus on improving your mental state for once. Go to therapy or something, it pays for itself over time. $100 bucks a month has improved my quality of life by 1000% this semester alone. Talk to them about what's causing you stress and figure out a way to conquer it or at least decrease the mental load.

Three, make a gameplan for the future. I'd suggest setting aside a couple of hours every day to study or do homework and spend the rest of your free time doing whatever. Obviously increase as needed, but if you do it right this will be a rare occurrence.

Four, let go of the past. If you hang onto it instead of accepting it, you'll always be standing in your own way.

Best of luck to you. Unfortunately I speak from hard fucking experience here so I promise, if you make a solid commitment to getting better instead of wallowing in self-pity, it will pay off, and the sooner you start, the better.",positive,0.9883,positive,0.09121645021645022,12/12/2019

comments,"When you grade over a hundred answers to the same math question, you find out that there are only a handful of ways people make an error.  You quickly learn how to recognize the category of error and can grade it almost instantly.  Since you know that the mistake was precisely the same the previous students made, you know exactly how much to take off for that type of mistake.

BTW, if your grades are borderline you might want to look carefully at your answers to see if your mistakes were simple or serious.  The fact is that there are some graders who take a serious hammer to students for even simple mistakes, while people like myself care more about whether you demonstrated that you understood the important underlying concepts.  Often, professors are pretty lenient and will be more than willing to work with you, but only if it'll make a difference in your final grade.

comments,"Something like that, but it was more complicated. The final assignment is designed to be the easiest. It is even worth more—15% instead of 10%—to give students a chance to raise overall scores. By contrast, the final exam—worth 25%—is legendarily harder and the mean is something like 30 points lower than the final assignment. I gave students the option to not do that assignment and instead have the final worth 40%. Clearly a dumb idea. 

But there’s more.

So, after computing final grades I go back and look at every student who does better on the final than the midterm and substitute the exam score. *If* it would raise the grade I then look at the assignments and see if there is improvement, more or less, across the four assignments and if there is I assign the higher grade. This process impacts a good 10-15% of the students each term. Of course, if one doesn’t do the final assignment that’s not an option, so it’s clearly even dumber to not do that assignment. 

I explained all this to the class and predicted that many of them would do it anyway and it would lower a significant number of their grades. Afterwards I took the students who didn’t do the assignment and substituted their *average* scores on the assignments to see if it would have made a difference and for the vast majority of them, of course it did. 

I, for one, blame society.",positive,0.9655,positive,0.10817901234567902,12/12/2019

comments,"Tech students typically fall into 2 distinct categories in my experience. You have those who get mostly A’s and generally have upper 3.5+ GPAs and those who are just trying to pass and generally have 2.x GPAs. I don’t see a lot of the more ‘average’ category - that is people who get C’s very regularly but nothing below and would be borderline for hope.

Major is part of it, but I think the main difference between these 2 groups is what expectations they have of themselves. If you always go into classes aiming for an A but sometimes you fall short you’ll end up with with A’s, some B’s and possibly the occasional C. If you go into classes aiming for a C and expecting no better you’re not going to do better except in the ‘easy A’ classes. You’ll end up with mostly C’s with some D’s and F’s mixed in.

That is just to say you can probably keep hope/zell if you approach Tech with the right attitude. Don’t settle for a B or C when you can do better. Do your work with plenty of time to spare. Go to class. Get sleep. From what I’ve seen, most people who do these things do well.",positive,0.9455,positive,0.17188852813852815,12/12/2019

I left his office and immediately dropped the class. I was not going to dedicate myself to a class when the organizers did not care. That was ~2010.

There’s still very challenging classes, insane workloads, and apathetic profs that don’t teach well. As such, it still takes a significant toll on students (resulting in suicides in recent years). The only major difference would probably be Tech being increasing selective in its application process (lower admission rates = more academically competitive students = more likely to feel the imposter syndrome).

I think the difference is that our society (including Tech) has become more open to discussing mental health, specifically effects that academic stress can have on students. Because people are more aware of it now and understanding of it, there’s been a greater push for the administration to take action towards helping students cope with the stress.",negative,-0.4746,positive,0.1592391304347826,12/12/2019

comments,"&gt; but as a person who requires money, I love tax refunds even more

Or you simply figure out what your liability is and divide that by the number of paychecks in the year, pick the allowance that most closely resembles that, include any additional withholding, and get your money during the year. 

Giving the government an interest free loan is never a good idea. 

&gt; If you receive a W-2, you MUST fill out a tax form

Also this is false. You are not required to file a tax return if your income is under $12,200 federally and you are a single filer, despite whether or not you receive a W-2. Certainly if you had taxes taken out, I would recommend you do file to get them back. But if you were smart and put exempt, then there's nothing to get refunded and you have zero federal filing requirements. 

&gt; Keep track of unreimbursed Medical expenses and be sure to deduct them if they are eligible.

That requires itemizing your taxes. You can only deduct any expenses over 10% of your AGI. If your AGI were 45,000, you cannot deduct the first $4500 of medical expenses. since the standard deduction if $12200, you would have to have $16701 in medical expenses (or other itemized expenses including charitable expenses or mortgage interest) to beat the standard deduction. Very rarely is itemizing your taxes for medical expenses ever beneficial. 

&gt; Being married changes the tax rules, keep this in mind if you got married

The rules are the same for everyone. All that is different is your tax bands have doubled in size. I hope that both couples, if working, did not elect to withhold as married, because then you get into a situation where you typically owe a bunch of money.",positive,0.9907,positive,0.11018253968253969,12/12/2019

comments,"1. I have no qualms about giving the government an interest free loan, particularly when getting a job during the course of year post-graduation leads to an uncertain tax burden.
2. Technically, not everyone must fill out a tax form with a W-2, correct. But everyone should. It's generally a good standard procedure, and putting exempt is rarely recommended for someone who has a variable income like  most students who may participate in Co-ops or internships dependent on offers.
3. I didn't say deducting medical expenses was helpful all the time, but some students have high medical expenses. It's just something to keep track of in case it applies.
4. When I say, marriage changes the rules, I mean that it changes your filing status from single to married. This changes deductions and income brackets if you file jointly.",positive,0.9045,positive,0.15662414965986393,12/12/2019

comments,"1) or, I don't know, get your money evenly throughout the year and save it yourself? You state in your OP you require money - as most of us do. So get your money during the year in your paycheck, not held hostage by the government. You could've been earning interest on that money yourself. You can adjust your withholdings to compensate for employement at any time during the year. Giving up your money earlier by failing to calculate out your liability because of something that may or may not happen is foolish. You can change your W-4 at any point in time. 

2) If you know you are only working in say, the summer or one internship term, and your income won't go above $12,200, you are perfectly able to put exempt and then you don't have to bother with filing out a 1040. Being a student with variable income that rarely goes above the standard deduction is precisely a reason someone would use exempt for. That's exactly what I did for all of my years in college. If you are working in the spring and don't anticipate working in the fall and hit exempt, and then do get additional employment, you can readily adjust your withholdings for your second job. There is zero reason anyone should have federal tax withheld if they firmly believe they will be under $12,200 for the year - the confines of one internship a calendar year should leave you right under or near that.",positive,0.9109,positive,0.15571428571428575,12/12/2019

Hardest: Math 2552. Damn thing felt impossible, I stayed the whole time and left thinking I didn't know anything. Felt worse also because it was dark outside when I finished. Ended up going fine, and thanks to the curve I ended with an A. Second test grade carried me, and I think the prof took pity on me and deleted a quiz grade because it was mathematically impossible for me to get an A according to the syllabus as it was.

Dumbest: BMED 2250. Basically a handwritten essay about what our project was through the class. Easy 100% but I was writing for the whole time. 10 pgs front and back, definitely overkill. I'm ambidextrous but by the time I left both hands were cramping lol.

Most infuriating: BMED 3310. I asked a clarification question and got told the wrong thing by one TA. Set up the whole question wrong as a result and got almost no points out of 30.

comments,"I was an undergrad 2001-05 and now currently enrolled in a grad program. It feels very different to me. I don't remember a constant barrage of emails from a) the institute, b) the college, c) the school, d) the program, all with dozens of poster competitions, lectures, clubs, etc. They kind of push the FOMO a lot more. It was highly stressful just to figure out what to pay attention to this semester. 

Tech green didn't exist 15 years ago and there was lot less activity in campus in general. 

The classes are still crazy tough. 

In certain ways, grad school is better because the professors seems to care about and respect you more. 

The students seem more competitive with each other. And less social. Maybe I'm in a weird cohort, but no one makes time to socialize.

I used on campus mental health services in 2005 and it was great. Now I'm afraid to even try.

One really fucked up thing is they claim my prize medical records were invalid and I needed new vaccinations, I shut that down real quick.

Seems like there used to be better frat parties (like bands in front yards) better homecoming displays (didn't Hardy see any this year), etc, but that could be me being nostalgic.

Home park hasn't changed. Rocky mountain even plays the same shitty metal music. 

There used to be tons of dope spots on campus to hide and get high, but just like the beltline erased any wild edges, campus is now fully accounted for and well lit, I would never try to light up...

Would totally recommend it. Idk who is the main professor of it this summer, most likely Tatiana because Stewart did last year.  Riga is great you can go to beach a lot (Jurmala) and Peter is just so beautiful. The host families love to converse so it will def improve your skills.

I asked for an extended visa to be allowed to stay in Russia for max time but you have to tell the professor in charge before you drop off your passport for visa in Latvia. Otherwise they only put your stay time as the last day of program but they can extend it til end of August. I recommend this because Russia is so freaking cheap it’s not hard to travel on pennies. A friend and I did the Trans Siberian and ended up in Kazakhstan by beginning of August . If you want travel tips to make the best of your time there let me know and don’t feel shy to dm.

I took 1553 when I was a ChBE major, but once I switched to CS, I had to take 1554 as well. The bridge class is not always offered, and it might make more sense in your situation to go ahead and take 1554 instead of waiting for the bridge class to be offered again. I have heard rumors that the bridge course is back this spring, but the information on it is always a little bit elusive. 

Fortunately for you, if you have to take 1554 like I did, it’s almost the exact same course as 1553. It has one more chapter on symmetric matrices, but the content doesn’t change much.

\-UL classes are way less work and easier than Tech, which is great if you want to relax and focus on travelling. They're still usually well taught though. Take the hard classes here if you can!

\-UL is the party school of Ireland. There are multiple bars on campus and parties are held almost every night. In the spring they even have an entire week unofficially off just for partying. If you're wanting to party you'll love it, but if that's not really your thing you may find it difficult to make friends, especially friends with the Irish students.

\-Limerick itself is a quaint, pretty city to live in. There are a couple things to do like the castle and weekend market, but its definitely not a major tourist attraction like Dublin or Galway. Ireland is small enough though that most popular places are day trips away via bus, so its easy to see the country.

comments,"I took both classes this semester and got A's in both, though had some previous background in discrete math having taken both math proofs and combinatorics. 

Jing's lectures are not very good, but she wants her students to succeed and gives you all the resources you need. All of the test and quiz questions will be things that you have gone over in lecture, recitation, or homework, and she posts her lecture notes online and is helpful on Piazza. Do the optional homework - it really is helpful to gain an understanding and not all behind. 

Craig Tovey is my favorite professor I've had at Georgia Tech so far and is a really kind and funny guy who loves chocolate and cares so much about his students. He makes you work hard and doesn't really give out high grades without you showing you know the material. The averages on the first two tests were in the low 50's, but those who worked hard seemed to get A's and B's, with the people doing worse seeming to not really put in the effort required of a difficult class. The homework is difficult and very problem-solving based, so I would definitely make sure that you are solid on your 2027 knowledge heading in and have time to devote to the class. 3232 will be the hardest class you take next semester if you take it with Tovey, but if you pay attention and ask respectful questions he is very understanding and will help you do well(the class average on a project that was worth 15% of our grade was around a 120 to boost our grades). 

To me, it didn't really feel like we really learned a lot in either class, but as long as you are able to understand the problem solving skills that Jing and Tovey want you to know, then you can really do well in both. Be willing to think outside the box, go to office hours, ask questions, and devote yourself to doing well in your classes, and you will be just fine. The people who showed up to class, paid attention, and studied did just fine in both of these, but I guess drop if you're not going to want to put in that effort.",positive,0.9955,positive,0.09010796221322535,12/15/2019

comments,"Now that we have a clue where you got your number, you can't tell how flawed it is?  Your statistic is national average, not grouped by demographics, which is college-going students.  And don't forget that website can't even disaggregate that way, since they only include age brackets, with no specificity regarding college-going versus non college-going.

My sources:  There are approximately 1100 suicides amongst college students per annum (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2924459/).  There are 19.9 million college students in the US. (https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372).

Furthermore, data on college suicide rates is really tricky to track down.  It's almost as if institutions have a vested interest in obfuscating this information, as well as privacy barriers to data collection (understandable).  Just to be clear, GATech has a per 100,000 rate of 18.69.  According to the best information about colleges I can find (https://www.sprc.org/sites/default/files/migrate/library/SuicideAmongCollegeStudentsInUS.pdf), that's much higher than the national average among college-age students.  Heck, this article suggests the number might be lower (https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/16/suicide-rate-mit-higher-than-national-average/1aGWr7lRjiEyhoD1WIT78I/story.html), but the studies it cites are pretty old.

In any case, we're avoiding the main discussion, hiding behind these numbers.  Again, I assert: GATech has a cultural problem that results in a lack of empathy and care towards its students.  While there are some well-intentioned faculty, the systemic issue is unaddressed, which contributes towards students' mental health decline.",negative,-0.1713,neutral,0.015359477124182985,12/15/2019

However he is extremely knowledgeable about the field and doesn’t mind passing more than half if they truly earn it. My semester he failed only 1 student and it was because he didn’t show up to more than half the classes. 

The truth is that 3040 is one of the hardest classes but it’s because there’s so much to learn and so little time. The fact that they combine device physics and intro analog ic into one course is ridiculous and not many schools do this around the country. 

I ended up taking many device physics courses after Boussert and at currently doing my PhD in device physics. Had it not been for him, I never would have developed the skills necessary for the field.",negative,-0.5346,negative,-0.06348039215686273,12/15/2019

comments,"A lot of people here have told you to stay strong, keep your chin up, use this as an opportunity, etc. These are all good suggestions, and I hope you follow them and I hope they make you feel a little better. However you also need to sit back and analyze the situation in order to find the real issue and fix it. 

Are you not strong, or not motivated, or not intelligent? I'm guessing you have all of those qualities in abundance. So what has actually gone wrong? Are you pursuing a degree in a field you are no longer interested in? Are you skipping classes? Are you not approaching TAs or study groups even after you realize you need help in a course? Are you taking more classes than you feel comfortable taking? Are you playing video games all day instead of doing homework assignments? Are you burned out? Are you depressed (well, prior to this bad news)?

My point is you need to figure out what exactly went wrong here in order to course-correct. Shame and despair are a natural result of this outcome, and it may be difficult to think straight for a couple of days after receiving news like this, but I'd advise you to focus your thoughts on figuring out what went wrong and what you could have done differently. You are going to have a second opportunity after the one missed semester, so all is not lost.

The ""good news"" is you do have some time to think about all this. A change of scene will help. Maybe spend the next couple of months doing some travel (it doesn't have to be super expensive, if you have a car do a couple of road trips, or visit a national park and go on a few hikes, etc). Don't wallow in sorrow. Remind yourself why you enrolled, why you picked the subject you did, and ask yourself if you want to change fields. And then think of the future, not the past.

If you return to tech and graduate this will all become ancient history. The bad gpa will likely affect which jobs you get upon graduating, but once you've had a couple of jobs no one is going to care what your gpa was or how many semesters it took you to graduate. I'm speaking as someone who has failed classes, pulled together, graduated, and worked a few years. Hang in there.",positive,0.92,neutral,-0.02578828828828828,12/16/2019

Nice snarky comment. But maybe you are not as clever as you think.

They then gave an example of a bachelors and a masters that they took that were very different, yet only required them to take one prerequisite for the masters.

Easy as hell, you could teach yourself this course and pass the final in a week. You could safely put this on the back burner, study for exams the night before, do the bare minimum on projects, and still get a B. This is what I did.

If I could do this class over again, I would try to be proactive and find a team willing to do the ""heavyweight"" option for the class, where you make a UI for the database queries and don't have to take the final. Though the exams aren't hard to begin with, in order to get an A you need to know your shit or have a really, really good memory.

&gt;CS 4641

I dunno. It's one of the ML classes I think and from what I understand they're a bitch.

&gt;CS 4261

Super easy class, you make a mobile app (it can be anything you want) in 2-week sprints until the final sprint, which is 4 weeks is when you're expected to have a minimum viable product. You've also gotta make a report and presentation for each sprint, those can take a while due to the large amount of stuff you need to write about, but they aren't hard. No final, but the project is 50% of your grade. Naturally this is a coding-heavy class. It's easier if you have a good team.

Also, we had to compete at the CIC, if your app is good enough you may be able to win some cool shit.

&gt;CS 4235

A decent bit of material, it'll take up a fair bit of time, but exams are easy enough (multiple choice when I took it). Homeworks are bitchy, I'd get a head start on those if you get the chance. When I took it there was a binary exploitation project (on the stack), a web exploitation project, and another project or two I can't remember off the top of my head. Beware you need to know your computer architecture for this class at the level of 2200, it'll be considerably more difficult otherwise.",positive,0.9759,positive,0.19576330532212885,12/16/2019

I ended up finding a remote job that was a better fit than any opportunity I had locally. Check out stackoverflow.com. They have a lot of remote job postings that could put your CS minor to good use. 

Also, try to find someone to practice interviewing with. I think Tech has professionals/alums in the career center that can do mock interviews, but practicing with friends can be helpful too. They can point out things in your body language/interview answers that you might not notice at first. I had a friend who practiced with me a lot before I got my first fulltime job after college. Without his help, I don't think I would have landed that role. 

Last, don't think of not getting an offer as ""failing"" an interview. You will psych yourself out if you look at it that way.

You are **very** close to a humblebrag there, but I will give you the benefit of the doubt.   

The lesson to learn from your lone ""C"" is that you are not in Kansas anymore.     

You were likely lights out smart in high school. You are still doing fine. But when you now get results that are not as good as the results you expect, the key is not to say

but rather    

*I didn't get the grade I wanted/expected/hoped for. Things done changed between when I was in high school and now that I am here at Tech.

* Do not worry about registration too much. They have FASET leaders walking around helping you out when you'll register. In addition, GT reserves some spots in freshmen classes for every FASET class so you should be fine in most cases.
* They have orgs lined up around Tech green during that time. Try to find an org you're interested in!

comments,"For the replied below, basically every school does this. The reason being is that it allegedly causes undue burden on the professors and the administrators to process final grades before everyone else in order to prepare for graduation. Also if you think about it, there is about a 36 hour difference between the last finals and graduation. Say a professor has even 1 class, that’s what, 20-50 finals to grade just for that class? Most professors have research deadlines and more classes at that time too. Yeah it’s annoying but I feel like it makes sense to me the timeline in which they do it. 

If that happened to you I’m really sorry. However, most if not all companies understand when required classes get a D/get failed and will work around the rework for the classes. 

OP it will be okay!! I promise. One of my close friends had this happen to her. She accepted a job for Microsoft out of state and got to work for them and retake her class she didn’t pass.

comments,"A very similar situation happened to me a few years ago. I petitioned for a retroactive withdrawl and was approved, but it required proof that I was receiving sustained treatment for depression, a number of doctors notes, and I believe an essay. I also worked closely with my academic advisor on a plan for returning to school. Academic dismissal probably feels like the end of the world to you right now. It was extremely isolating to me, and I also wanted to get back to school as soon as I could and pretend like nothing had happened. However, I would think long and hard about whether rushing back to school is the best move for you. It takes a number of failed semesters to get to this point, so academic dismissal tells you that there are chronic problems with your academic performance. Through therapy and self-reflection I realized that I needed to give myself a break from the stress of school to let myself heal, so I worked at some low-stress jobs for a year and worked on my mental health. I also needed to figure out how to be a good student again, so I took classes at Perimeter to build study habits. After all this I re-applied and returned to Tech. While it hasn’t been easy, I just graduated this semester with honors. The break was invaluable to me and without it I don’t think I would have succeeded returning right to school. Everyone is different so taking summer classes might be feasible for you, but I wanted to give you another perspective and let you know that it will all work out ok.

I don't follow volleyball much, so I don't know the whole picture. But just looking purely at results, GT clearly has the best resume of the 4. It looks like the ACC isn't very strong this year, so SoS may have been a little low, and GT didn't have many wins over quality opponents, but that doesn't explain why 3 other ACC teams were put in ahead of them.

comments,"&gt; Tech finished higher than three of them in terms of conference record

Like I said, conference record isn't everything. Anyone who follows the selection process in any sport knows this. On top of that, you should be comparing GT to other bubble teams, not FSU or ND. But since you brought them up, I will do the comparison for you, since you clearly haven't.

**FSU RPI: 36**  
SOS: 27  
Wins vs. Top 25: 2  
Wins vs. Top 100: 6

**GT RPI: 56**   
SOS: 103   
Wins vs. Top 25: 0  
Wins vs. Top 100: 4

RPI in volleyball is a hugely important metric that the committee uses, much more so than in basketball.  FSU was not considered a bubble team. In fact, GT wasn't even really that much in the conversation on selection day.

&gt;I know the student center can be considered a polling station for early voters who register with their GT address.

I don't think the student center is a polling place anymore. It was during the 2016 election but hasn't been one since then. Check your My Voter Page on the secretary of state's website for updates on this.

&gt;By voting at the student center do I risk the losing the anonymity I am entitled to as a voter ?

No, you vote on machines that have privacy barriers. Nobody knows who you vote for. 

&gt;Should I just vote at my hometown precinct to be safe ?

If your hometown isn't Atlanta and you're registered to vote there, you literally cannot vote in Fulton. You have to vote at your designated polling place, shown on mvp.sos.ga.gov

&gt;Who actually supervises the student center during elections?

The Georgia state elections office supervises the polling places.

&gt;If GT students are supervising the polling area I am concerned that information about who we vote for could be leaked as a way to publicly shame people who don't align with their views.

You also can't choose to vote wherever you want. Wherever you're registered some number of months before the election is where you have to vote, usually a singular building (or vote early with a paper ballot, the safest and I'd say easiest way).

Note that the 2017 exposure leaked the State voters' personal records onto the open Internet to the point where it was indexed by Google crawlers on a public-facing website - that's SSN's, addresses, names, etc. This data could be used not only for ID theft, but to systematically change voter registration info and destructively take masses people off of the voter rolls. 

Every Georgia voter should therefore verify their eligibility to vote before EVERY election: https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp.do

I found KKB back in the spring of my freshman year the night before my English portfolio was due.  Someone had posted a video clip in Slack that used the beginning of Flamingo as background music, which I thought sounded pretty neat, which led me to KKB on Spotify.  KKB was probably a significant part of what got me through that miserable all-nighter.

One of the coolest things was hearing lyrics switch back and forth between two languages so fluidly.  Oh, and this was right before I went to work for a certain semiconductor company that makes DRAM (I don't recommend working for them -- long story short, they reneged on my return offer *after* I accepted it) that had acquired a bankrupt Japanese DRAM manufacturer.  My group had weekly meetings with foundries in Japan.  KKB's lyrics added to the list of places where I was noticing Japanese come up in my life, which, once I found out about the meetings, pushed me to start learning Japanese (besides what little grammar I had learned of at that point being quite interesting and reminding me of the Latin that I had learned in middle and high school).

comments,"timing seems to be a bit off. believe all regular cycle grad acceptances typically go out a little later into the new year. application period for many grad schools are still open, even as of today. it may have been a pre-arranged transfer - adviser in school X has been working with student in school Z; adviser really wants student to transfer over to school X under their supervision (e.g. because of student's unique research specialization, prior experience(s)/expertise, skill set(s), etc.) and sponsors them.

I wonder how much impact news of this farewell message would really have on their acceptance if this were the case - i.e. adviser has already vouched and committed to sponsoring him/her; the student isn't just a general acceptance that'll be putz'ing around looking for an adviser for another 1-2 semesters.",positive,0.8689,positive,0.10055361305361304,12/19/2019
comments,"workload - not bad at all. honestly its not a lie when they say its easier than the typical majors at GT (engineering, etc). get ready for hella presentations though

community - pretty decent. alot of people are close knit in the business school and form their friend groups. a bit competitive but for the most part i think its healthy. the faculty and staff are great tho

internship ops- the best. they send out job alerts to us about all types of internships, co ops, and full time jobs and many companies also visit us for info sessions. they love to hire students from scheller. the school is very career oriented

entrepreneurial resources - admittedly im not too familiar with what scheller has to offer in terms of entrepreneurial resources but i think there might be a certificate / a few classes around this subject? im sure scheller offers something for that tho",positive,0.9889,positive,0.3346491228070175,12/19/2019

But my experience with classes at other schools is that people go to classes and go home and don’t really want to socialize with you. People at Scheller are comparatively nicer and more willing to have a conversation and develop friendly relationships with you. I’m not Greek and I made lots of friends here, Greek and non-Greek. 

Also classes are pretty easy so you will have plenty of time to pursue your interests outside of school, whether it’s partying or reading or sports, which I think is very nice.",positive,0.9866,positive,0.22135531135531133,12/19/2019

As a student athlete business major I'm kind of a stereotype, but I chose Scheller because I am genuinely interested in business, not because of percieved difficulty. Not too many of the classes have been tough thanks to many great professors, however there are certainly tough ones. Management Statistics really threw me for a loop the second half of the semester. I definitely think many classes are easier/less workload than engineering classes, but that's not to say that the top achievers at Scheller are less dedicated or smart than top engineering students just because they're not having to pull 3AM benders to study.

Overall though I feel super lucky to attend a business school with the resources Scheller has.

To some degree, there's pressure here to do something meaningful with your summer, like intern, work, volunteer, or study abroad.  This first summer is a great time to study abroad, as you're more likely to find internships later.  Everyone I know who's studied abroad has loved it, so seriously consider it if you're a even little interested.  Plus, it can get you ahead with credits.

comments,"General guide to getting one this early:
1. Identify what skills you have, and what the jobs need. In general, almost any engineering major can take internships at manufacturing facilities, but almost no one will be able to have the skills to work at JPL. If you just happen to have robotics project experience though, you may have a chance.
2. Make tailored resumes for different jobs with the help for C2D2. You can go to them for all kinds of prep work, like getting an elevator pitch ready and getting interview ready.
3. Attend every career fair you can, be excited and be energetic. Talk to all kinds of companies.
4. Apply online, apply online, apply online. You should aim for over 60 jobs at over 20 companies. Which is a lot. But, I promise, you’ll get some responses back.
5. Take what you get, don’t snub an offer for not being the absolute perfect thing. The experience will be worth it. But, at the same time, wait as long as you can to accept in case you do get something good.

I definitely wouldn't want my tuition money going towards implementing one of their overpriced schemes. It took Apple over 10 years to implement near field communications (NFC) in their devices (after it was in Microsoft and Android devices for well over a decade), they then locked it down to only support Apple Pay (it's used for a lot more on Android devices), then they tried to force retailers to buy new machines to support it. Meanwhile ""real"" technology companies like Samsung matured their NFC solutions, while also developing technology to support the older magnetic strip readers that retailers had. This is why Samsung Pay works at almost every retailer in the US and Apple Pay doesn't.

Apple also got caught influencing and overcharging the Los Angeles Unified School District for iPads (which had a lot of technical issues), causing the FBI to investigate the issue. I also worked for the US government and had my ear to ground on a few failed deployment of Apple products. All ended the same way -- Apple didn't fully support what the user needed, Apple tried to force their way of doing things on the user (instead of adapting to the user's needs), and Apple overcharged for their products/services. Incidentally, they all started the same way also -- some person who had influence in the contracting process and who didn't fully understand the technological needs of the organization, bought an iPhone, iPad, or Macbook, was impressed by how it looked (or made them feel) then tried to force the entire organization to switch to Apple products because they ""were the future."" It was only after the organization spent a ton of money did they realize that Apple was not all it appeared to be.

GATech's tuition is high enough already (although we do get a ton of impressive services to go along with it). No need to make it any higher by putting our faith in a company (Apple) that has proven to be all glitz with little to no substance. I would love to have contactless student IDs. However, I think the school should look at a ton of companies offering the technology and base the final decision on who best supports the school's needs..",positive,0.9736,positive,0.08670411006617904,12/21/2019

If you're dead-set on taking the new offer regardless of the consequences, here's what I would recommend if you want to avoid burning bridges.

\*Call\* your recruiter, explain the situation. Tell him that you've received another offer that you really like (out of the blue?), apologize, tell him that this is really shitty and it seems like you're some dumb college student that doesn't have any respect for the hiring process, then emphasize that you intend to keep things professional and would like to work with them.

Ask at this point if they have any secondary choices that they would be willing to take in your place, and say that you will decline the other offer if there is no way for them to get ahold of another candidate.

This general script will help get the recruiter's sympathy and come across as being genuinely apologetic and not wanting to burn bridges. I'd bet that the recruiter will either come up with another person to hire without complaining to C2D2, or they may even be willing to change your initial offer to incentivize you to stay.

If this doesn't work, you're gonna have to pull the fast one you were gonna pull anyway. Good luck.",positive,0.914,positive,0.12892561983471074,12/21/2019

Co-ops (im my experience) are more likely to accept less-experienced candidates since you’ll be around longer and they can teach you more.

comments,"Context is important.  I used a generalization of an archetypical Trump voter and drew a direct parallel between an aspect I find common to his supporters (selfishness) and the mentality of a person who worked for Tech parking services.   In both cases I am drawing from 1st hand observations.  I know  Trump supporters I would describe as selfish;  in contrast I also know some that I would not describe that way (at least not as the salient aspects of their personalities), but the latter are in the minority in terms of Trump supporters within my social sphere.  My acquaintance who worked for PTS was a bit of a blowhard.  Less obnoxious than most loudmouths I have dealt with, but with considerably less empathy than the majority of students I encountered at Tech.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep in mind that I did not characterize this person, nor Trump supporters as wrong, nor jerks in my original reply.   Nothing in my description  of him, or of my generalization of Trump voters was a pejorative.  Your post is where you say that (according to me) these people are wrong and/or jerks.   You effectively put those words in my mouth.  ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw\_man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) )

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to continue this line of argument/discussion then I'm not convinced its going to be productive.   While I do have friends who are Trump supporters, the majority of them have large swaths of ignorance,  apathy or outright cognitive dissonance over issues I consider to be basic human or constitutional rights.  That is where my generalization of selfishness comes from.     As for my belief in whether some of these folks are jerks or not....   as I said earlier, there are a few positions which automatically put you in that category.  Denial of basic human rights is one of them.    Its the same mentality that allowed slavery, segregation, genocide of the native population, internment of the Japanese and slew of other atrocities to flourish in this country and that does make someone a ""wrong jerk"" in my book.

comments,"**Straw man**

A straw man is a form of argument and an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be ""attacking a straw man"".

The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., ""stand up a straw man"") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument (""knock down a straw man"") instead of the opponent's proposition.  Straw man arguments have been used throughout history in polemical debate, particularly regarding highly charged emotional subjects.

Most internships for freshmen/sophomores are more behavioral than technical, so take advantage of the fact that recruiters don't expect you to know anything too specific to the job and focus on selling yourself through the ""why do you want to work in this company/industry/role"" aspects.

For most programs, it is sometime after the application deadline.  Usually PhD is first (as those have funding decisions that make them more urgent) and then MS.

comments,"Just took it last semester with 18 credit hours and research. Ended up not getting an A, but to be fair I think the class does get an excessively bad rep. There is a lot of work involved, probably more on par with a 4 credit hour class, and the prelab quiz grading is brutal, but it's definitely not the impossible beast that it's all hyped up to be. 

I'd say as long as you can block off ~8 hours a week for doing the prelab, lab report, and studying for the prelab quizzes, you should be mostly fine. I would block off more time for labs 6 and 8 (those actually are pretty time-consuming), and the in-class-exam (curved average was in the mid 70s).

Other than that, the project is the only concern for your time. I found the project not too bad, but my group divided the work evenly, which definitely is not a guarantee.",negative,-0.7359,neutral,-0.04999999999999998,12/25/2019

Once phase II registration comes around, anyone can enroll in CS courses if there are seats remaining. One of the few exceptions to this rule are people doing CS minors.

It sucked bc i actually registered for the class and paid the tuition to have a seat but more than not, ended up on the floor. (But also 1st world problem..worse things could happen) I heard they battled the problem in subsequent semesters by only allowing people In the room via buzzcards so I’m not sure if it’s as much as a problem anymore.

comments,"The problem CompE at GT has is that it's horribly advertised. Most students have no idea what the real differences are between EE CE and CS, and tech doesn't really seem to care or help.

CE is the major for those who want to go into computer architecture and silicon design, it is a VERY niche major compared to most. If you want to do these things, do CE. If not, you will feel like you have been cheated (see the false advertising post where, IMO, the person had a different definition of CE than GT does). A large part of this problem is that CE is a new major, not just at Tech, but in the world. It changes a lot between colleges still. CE is often described as CS meets EE, when in reality it's much more similar to its own entity at Tech.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to answer some of your questions directly:

Research: GT has some really cool research in related fields. Look around on the internet and you'll be able to find a lot of them. I've heard lots about ML processor architecture as well as cooling architecture (hard to explain, but theres a lab trying to liquid cool through tunnels in the die itself).

Professors: Are the people who are creating the major. Again, since CE is so new, these professors are often the one's defining the curriculum. They are all ECE profs, not CS.

Internship: Same as every other major, just very specific. CE's take classes very few others do, so if you find an internship that uses those skills, you have a good shot.

Job: See Above. Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom, TI, Microchip, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin... Anyone who designs silicon will want CEs.

CS Classes: There are no classes required by this major in CS college. That being said, you will have to take C/C++ courses within ECE. Also, your CE electives can be filled with either ECE or CS classes, although it can be very hard to get into CS classes. GT is working on this, and are planning to give CE students priority into CS classes in the future (But that's a little far away).",positive,0.9277,positive,0.0923967473967474,12/26/2019

1. His/her/its response could be an implicit response. 'I didn't even have the opportunity to interact with them at all, not even an online presence in our community! Could we really consider them the same if they don't have an on-campus presence?' 

For me, that really depends on the individual viewing the question. For a typical college-aged kid, things like an on campus presence and sporting events could be huge things, but for a working adult? Who cares. As long as the online community can be shown to be held up to the same, or even higher, or maybe just slightly lower, standards than the on campus community, there's no reason to view them differently. It's a branding issue. initially, that benefit of doubt is given to them due to the same administrating community. However, it's something they need to build up with time, and no one can give a straight answer.

2. Even if not. reddit is a forum where everyone comes by with different expectations and standards of rigour to their comments. Expecting everyone to have the same standard is just not realistic.

comments,"If you are more interested in building embedded devices from parts, digital hardware prototyping, and how a computer works down to the transistor and it's hardware architecture, CompE is for you. If you're more interested in algorithms, theory, machine learning, and how to build mobile apps, CS is for you. There's quite a bit of overlap in the fundamentals of software engineering though, for me I was not limited in my software career opportunities by being a CompE instead of a CS, I just came out with a lot more knowledge on how to build physical devices than designing mobile apps. That being said, I still landed my dream job developing DJ software straight out of college.

CompE is a bit more challenging, I think. You're stuck with more of the math/physics weighted curriculum and the subject matter can be a bit more hardcore. Courses like physics 2 are brutal, courses like Computer Architecture will test your open ended problem solving skills repeatedly with absolutely no margin for error, and will help you build your larger scale software design process skills. 

Some CompE courses were hella fun and more or less straightforward to perform well. I can't remember the course numbers, but there are a couple courses in your Junior-ish years where you spend most of your time getting your hands dirty with Ardunio-like microcontrollers and all the different components you can attach to them and program to do whatever. These courses are a lot more forgiving and enjoyable, where the final projects are open ended and you can build anything you want.

comments,"No not really,which is ok, but here's why I wouldn't. 

1. the admission process is significantly easier for the online program. They accept virtually anyone and their mom into the program with a bachelors degree/maybe associates. If you get rejected, you could go to a community college, take 2 CS classes, and reapply and you would get accepted.  No GRE is required for the online program, unlike the masters.

2.  I would say the on campus lectures are much better than some of the ""dumbed down"" udacity lectures. The quality of discussions in an on campus lecture is better because more students are involved in research.  In OMSCS, some students are still trying to master basic recursion or big O. These folks are business analysts/QAs/project managers/consultants working in industry trying to become software engineers. This is fine, but if you're a Software engineer/ someone with some CS background, it can be frustrating to work on a project with someone with no experience at all.

3. OMSCS have a limited course option, while the masters program has more specialized classes like randomized algorithms,3D reconstruction, comp perception, natural language, pattern recognition.

comments,"I've commuted from Marietta before so I think I can speak to this some.

Dalney Deck is more towards north campus and it's near GTRI. If you want a job there, pick that deck. Even if you don't, that's not a terrible parking location, but obviously it's not near Skiles. Leaving you'll exit onto 10th St, which is a bitch past 4:00 or so, then you'll have a left to make onto Williams St, which may or may not be trafficky. Depends on the day. That leads onto 75N. Or you could find your way to Northside Dr via Hemphill Ave and skip that initial congestion out of Atlanta, but Northside Dr can get pretty backed up as well. At least it's a right onto 75N and you don't have to deal with lefts in the city.

FWIW, when I was commuting, I was parked in a lot near GTRI, and the commute back home was 45-60 min during rush hour (maybe 30 on a good day?), and the commute to school was 30-45 min during rush hour.

If you choose the Tech Square deck, you'll be a lot closer to the heart of campus and to Tech Square, which has its benefits. Unfortunately, you have to walk up a massive hill to get to Tech Square, and the Tech Square lot is on Spring St, which imo is the busiest road in Atlanta. That exits onto the 85/75N split, which is always backed up and full of cars merging like crazy. If you're scared of that idea, don't choose the Tech Square lot.

So in the end, they both suck in their own unique ways, and you're gonna hate it regardless, especially if you're not leaving campus early in the afternoon or late in the evening. Pick whichever sounds better to you.",negative,-0.6092,positive,0.0650297619047619,12/29/2019

They want to see that you've taken the most challenging courses available to you and done well in them. FYI, GPA calculations are only done once the class is set (and then only for enrolling students), for data and USG (University System of Georgia) compliance purposes.

Keep in mind though that most students who apply are academically qualified, so your entire applications is considered, not only your grades. That said, competitive students will generally have an A average, unweighted (read: mostly A's). You never know, hopefully you've spent time on your application.

* If you are a BME/CS undergrad, the software engineers you will try to interview for will always ask why you chose BME. There are few/no exciting industry opportunities for a BME/CS undergrad (they are all of Ph. D bioinformatics students), so you'd primarily wanna look for undergraduate research opportunities from universities (primarily geared to kids who've made up their minds about grad school) or something that focuses primarily on one or the other degree.

comments,"&gt;very little distinction between what is offered online vs on campus.

I actually strongly disagree with this statement. There are a ton of very interesting special topic courses (CS 8803) that are offered every semester than OMSCS students are unable to take. For example, CS8803 Biomedical Modeling, Deep Learning for Text Data, Systems for Machine Learning, etc from the CS department alone (not even touching CSE).

The other thing that OMSCS students miss out on is professor-student interaction. The CS8803 class that I took last semester had something like 20 students, and all of us ended up getting to know the professor fairly well by the end of the course. In fact, I'm now working with the professor to publish my final project at a conference.

If one guy works at a big firm and has two-year valuable experience, in the meantime obtained a master degree from online education. Don’t you think this experience (two-year work experience + MS degree) no way can be obtained by the on-campus student?

You want to make your resume impressive one reason can be that you want to find a job in a big firm. As most on-campus students lack real work experience, they have to utilize on-campus resources to do better projects or get good recommendation letters from professors.

I'm seeing that $58k in 2010 was equivalent to just over $68k in 2018, so at best the improvement is about $2k in starting salary (although inflation from 2018 to now brings that down even further).

Meanwhile, using these reports for tuition costs in Fall 2009 vs Fall 2019:

http://www.bursar.gatech.edu/student/tuition/fy20_all-fees.pdf

we see that in-state tuition for a single semester (over 6 hrs) went from $3035 to $5129. I'm seeing that $3035 in 2009 is roughly $3700 in 2019, so tuition growth outpaced inflation by about $1400 a semester, or $2800 a year.

comments,"Though I’m probably old by your standards (33),  when I was in college, I played two sports, did a double-major and graduated in 3.5 years. I had no time for any relationships, and it was hard (life in general, not to mention relationships). Not everyone stays busy like that, but if you aren’t busy and you are lonely, I recommend getting busy. Go and volunteer or try something ridiculous with the intent that it is for you and not to meet someone. 

It can suck not being in a relationship, but there are benefits: you get comfortable being you and not giving a shit what other people think. You learn a lot about what you like to do and learn more about you as a person. This gives you confidence—not arrogance. Confidence in who you are by knowing what you are not— and it is something a significant other will appreciate.

When I graduated, I went right into grad school, dated a bit, and then met the person I ultimately married. By the time we met, I was comfortable with myself to know exactly what I was looking for and what my deal-breakers were.
