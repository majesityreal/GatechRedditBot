comments,"  Hi u/Vipee624,

This is a part-time experience intended for passionate people who would like experience prior to seeking full-time employment at larger companies.  It should be noted that we as co-founders have not anticipated payment either – we have invested our time and research in return for experience developing and marketing a product which can help people. We are inviting someone to join our Create-X Startup Launch team, not to hire into a pre-established company.

However, that being said, payment is being discussed with our financial advisors and is tied with the success of the company. If you have farther questions, please feel free to send us an e-mail!",positive,0.967,positive,0.125,03/31/2019

comments,"It's not nearly as bad as it used to be. Like others have said, not noticeable around campus, can be noticeable in classes depending on your major.

But what are the actual numbers? Well, I have an exam tomorrow that I don't want to study for, so let's break it down!

Admissions likes to be clever and publish the ratio for *admitted* students, not of students *actually enrolling*. Luckily, the more useful data is [publicly available](https://lite.gatech.edu/).

Looking [only at the freshman cohort, the past four years have been under 60/40](https://i.imgur.com/NQ8iC9e.png), with a clear trend of improvement over time. The 2018-19 cohort regressed a bit to 59.43/40.57, but the trend is still clear.

When it comes to [the total undergraduate population, there has been an improvement every year](https://i.imgur.com/oXnmYzj.png), as expected. As of the 2018-19 year, **The Ratio is 61.88/38.12**, a major improvement from the 68.93/31.07 back in 2010-11.

Edit: for your specific example of CS vs biology, there is an extreme ratio in each one.

[CS - 75.21% male, 24.79% female \(improving\)](https://i.imgur.com/YRvgL8x.png)

[Biology - 89.35% female, 10.65% male \(worsening\)](https://i.imgur.com/Ip3qjxi.png)

If you're not interested in doing an MD-PhD or at least being heavily involved in research in medical school, then you're better off pursuing a major at an easier institution and pulling off close to a 4.0 while also having a lot of campus connections/involvements (like being executives or members of clubs and stuff).",positive,0.838,neutral,0.039871031746031745,03/31/2019

comments,"Honestly I think LLCs are a bullshit way for GT to take more of your money. Source: I was in grand challenges my first year (2016). 

GC seems like a great idea on paper but in reality most projects that come out it are laughable. Like after coming to the end of the year poster session my mom said she had seen more thought out proposals from the third graders she teaches. It’s frankly insulting to the professionals who spend their whole lives attempting to solve these ‘grand challenges’ to act as though a bunch of freshmen with no real skills to speak of could solve such a problem. That’s not to say no worthwhile projects come out of GC, but those that do are typically smaller scale things like various educational events for children. And these succeed mainly through the efforts of the team members, not through any support GC offers.

GC costs $500 to participate in and honestly I don’t see the value. Teams are generally not given any significant funding for their projects and we consistently ran out of food at GC events despite constantly being told about how much funding the program receives from GT. And for the ‘retreat’ we did not go anywhere overnight, so I honestly do not understand where all the money goes.

That said, LLCs do tend to have more tight knit communities than a typical freshmen dorm. The downside to that is these friendships may tend to fizzle out after the first year when most people have limited to no involvement in the LLC. So don’t let it replace making friends with people who have actual shared interests.

In the end, it’s up to you. And of course I can’t speak for all LLCs though I have heard similar things about the honors program at least. I’m just saying that personally it didn’t add anything to my experience as a freshman.",positive,0.9858,positive,0.1256756756756757,03/31/2019

IE is the last stop on the m-train inside the college of engineering before it departs to the college of business. So many people try to get off at the IE stop that they actually have to make it one of the few restricted majors at Tech for internal transfers. The souls that are deemed not worthy of one last chance to become an engineer are not allowed off the m-train at the IE stop and thus continue on to the college of business where they will then precede to go through a lengthy recovery process to heal from the deep psychological wounds they suffered at the college of engineering.

comments,"I get new friends every year. Say hi to people around you. Here are some of the people I remember and how I met them:  
**Freshman year:**  
Dorm Room friends 4 of them, we used to go out to bars, concerts, movies

Met my best friend at a dining hall, he just came by and said hi.

**Sophmore year:**

Rented an apartment with couple of friends, met their friends through them, they were not my type.

**Junior Year:**

People that I met in dining halls, we used to go to buckhead bars together

Clubs, mountain biking, archery, I didn't have much close friends that year

I became the president of a club, met lots of people there. I even helped one of them hired, Best feeling ever. 

**Senior Year:**

People that I met in professional life, we go to bars

One friend that I met in freshman year is currently my best friend ever I guess. I would literally walk to end of the world with him. He was there for me in my hardest times.   


&amp;#x200B;

What I learned through college was I have to go out and say hi to people. Friends don't rain from the sky as they used to in highschool. If you make an effort to find friends, it usually works out. Be aware that you won't be compatible with everyone you say hi, so don't loose hope.

Most people wouldn’t recommend it. There aren’t many freshmen who don’t do freshman experience, and probably next to none who live in expensive apartments like SQ5. 

You’re going to be surrounded by 2nd year+ students who already have established friend groups and most probably aren’t really looking to socialize with people they happen to bump into in the apartment hallways. 

The only place you’re really going to be surrounded by fellow freshmen is through FE, and FE makes it so easy to make friends. As soon as you move into apartments after your first year, that social interaction through housing goes way down and you need to make much more of an effort to meet and interact with people.

&gt;Firstly, is SQ5 considered to be on east campus? How far away from Glenn dorms is it? 

Google maps is your friend.

The more often you go to that frat during rush (assuming you are well-behaved), the more likely you will be given a ""bid,"" to become a pledge at that frat.

comments,"I’ll try to explain both sides, but my bias is definitely going to be obvious. 

Pre-med at tech is bad:
The pre-recs are often harder than at other schools. Med schools place a lot of value on a high gpa, and schools don’t really take into account the relative difficulty of the school or major (mostly), so it might make sense to go somewhere “easier” to keep gpa high. 

Pre-med at tech is good:
I saw the pre-recs being hard as a positive. Because the classes were so rigorous, I didn’t need to study for the mcat nearly as much as friends from other schools. (As an example, we took a national standardized orgo test as our final for orgo 2 and the vast majority of the class got in the 85+ percentile range) But the thing a lot of pre-meds get caught up on is having a high gpa. Gpa is an important factor, but it is only one factor.  Equally as important are the mcat, which tech will prep you very well for, and the personal statement and activities sections. In the written sections you’ll need to show that you have been involved with medicine, and Atlanta/Tech is great for that with the plethora of hospitals and research opportunities. 

FWIW I got out with a good gpa and am going to med school in August, so it’s definitely doable at tech. Feel free to hit me up with any other questions about pre med or the med school school application process.

Also, you said you are attending GT. So I will say this, forget asking why doing premed at GT isn’t a good idea. That’ll just make you underconfident. Tell yourself that you can do it and look at the positives. Mental fortitude makes a huge difference. Don’t shoot yourself before you even walk in.

I would say go in, do your best. If you have to, take courses at another local institution during the summer etc if the profs aren’t good at GT, and just feel confident. Obviously you got in so you have the ability to succeed.

All the best to you. ",positive,0.9871,positive,0.31755952380952385,04/01/2019

comments,"**Bus bunching**

In public transport, bus bunching, clumping, convoying, piggybacking or platooning refers to a group of two or more transit vehicles (such as buses or trains), running along the same route, which were scheduled to be evenly spaced, but instead run in the same place at the same time. This occurs when at least one of the vehicles is unable to keep to its schedule and therefore ends up in the same location as one or more other vehicles which are supposed to be behind it.

The result is unreliable service and longer and more inconsistent effective wait times than scheduled. Another unfortunate result can be overcrowded vehicles followed closely by near-empty ones.

Then they use that ""temporary"" fee to fund critical infrastructure like water and electricity.

It's the same degree as on-campus, so it's the same curriculum. The only difference is that there are somewhat fewer courses offered. 

&gt; I'd imagine being on-campus would allow me to network, go to career fairs, etc

You can still go to the career fairs as an OMS student if you really want to. You have access to the online jobs board too. Still, really think about how much money $230k is. How are you going to pay for your degree? 

&gt; how stressful it'll be to work + study for 3ish years

comments,"Thanks for playing devils advocate with me on this. I really appreciate it.

Honestly, I was hoping to nail some type of GRA or GTA position to fund most of my degree. I know it's unlikely for the first semester, but a few MSCS students who I've reached out have told me that mostly everyone that they know in the program were able to find funded positions.

I also won't (in the worst-case scenario of not finding any positions during my entire MS) have to take out any loans since I'll be able to front the 50-60k tuition cost on my own. $223k in opportunity cost *is a lot of money*, definitely not denying that but I did the whole work + study thing last year with a few non-degree courses and really wasn't a fan of it.

The biggest pulls for me are 1) doing research / have closer relationships with profs on-campus 2) being able to take niche / advanced courses that I wouldn't be able to take in OMSCS 3) being able to build a network of peers from my classes 4) possibly even finish the MSCS far faster, even in 1.5 years if I go full-time.

EDIT: Also I know this is anecdotal and possibly meaningless but I posted the same exact question in the GT OMSCS Decisions thread and several people were advising me to go on-campus, making this an even more difficult decision for me.",positive,0.8829,positive,0.17586206896551723,04/01/2019

&amp;#x200B;

As for ranking personally  I'd say GT might have a slightly higher rep but to most employers and undergrad degree from both is more than enough to get your foot in the door. I know many people from both schools getting offers from Google, Microsoft etc. and both schools are regarded as excellent schools for cs. 

&amp;#x200B;

For your case I would say Tech makes a lot more sense because of your goals and interests. GT is ranked much higher than UCLA for Artificial intelligence in post-grad  and regularly works with the likes of Stanford, CMU and Berkley. What makes GT even sweeter for you is the 5 year BS/MS. As long as you have I think above a 3.4 (not too difficult if you do the work) you will not be required to submit GRE scores (something that might deter you if other schools don't have this program) and an automatic acceptance to the program but more importantly you will graduate with a top 10 undergrad degree and a top 5 CS Masters overall from a school that is recognized for its grad artificial intelligence programs all in hopefully 5 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

The last thing to consider is your fit. This is something only you can decide for your self. What things in life keep you happy? If you won't be happy at a certain school then it doesn't matter how good the school is because you won't be at your best which should be your #1 consideration. I'd recommend visiting both schools and try to get a feel of both atmospheres or at least talk to people from both schools to get a feel for them.

Startups have a different challenge. You instantly have more impact and everyone will know you very quickly. The pay will be higher if the company is looking to grow and you may get equity in the company as well. However, you will sacrifice time with your loved ones because of the nature of the environment and the requirements. But you get to point to things you built that go in prod quickly and feel proud of them immediately.

comments,"Definitely a valid question, and one I've been asked in interviews as well! The jumps weren't for income jumps, though those have happened every time as well. I have no issues working at a company for a while. In fact, the reason for the switches may even seem unconventional, though valid. My job with Oracle was in Silicon Valley and while that's the dream for many, I missed my family and my girlfriend back on the east coast. So me leaving that position and moving back to NYC was because I wanted to be closer to home. The new position was a consulting gig and while it's something I think a lot of engineers try, it really just wasn't a good fit for me. So after the project was over the company and myself both mutually agreed to part ways. The startup gig was extremely short lived. And that was because the company was growing at an incredible pace and essentially required 100 hour work weeks. Again, not a good fit. So me switching jobs wasn't because I wanted a boost in income. It's because every time, I made my decisions hastily and fell prey to the increase in pay and other factors.

In truth, finding the ""right one"" is difficult and as you grow up in the industry, you start to realize that it's not all about your income but about your happiness as well. My girlfriend is in medical school for example and finding time to spend with her is difficult enough as it is. My 5-10 year plan is to find the right fit and grow with the company, somewhere that I can take my experiences and make a positive impact, and go from there. I also am working on my own company which hasn't been released or announced yet. So I have things I'm working on. Finding that balance is very difficult for us, especially the ambitious ones.

All in all, companies don't really care about the job hopping, especially smaller ones. What they care about is what you bring to the table. And as long as you're strong technically and can be personable, the rest is irrelevant because it's a ""what can you do for me now"" industry ",positive,0.7312,positive,0.11949691722418992,04/02/2019

Grad Algos is currently in a shitfest tbh and it's hard to tell whether that's completely the fault of the grad TAs or whether that falls on him as well. He doesn't release practice exams, just provides some practice problems from  the textbook, and is giving us a midterm tomorrow over a unit we haven't had any hw or feedback for. So... he isn't coming off in the best light so far. Small sample size though, and a lot of the class is being ruined by the fact that grad TAs havent been doing their jobs and have skipped out on most of their office hours.

You also didn't need to be going fast enough that your best option was to bail in a way where you would be injured.

comments,"Hey, I went to GTAE for undergrad and Stanford for grad school so feel free to DM me. 

These are two very different schools so you should decide what's the best fit for you. Definitely don't just go off the rankings.

As some other users have said, cost should be a major factor. Stanford typically has good financial aid for lower income families, but Zell would be hard to pass up.

For the programs, GTAE is a much larger and more technically diverse program. Stanford's Aero/Astro (AA) department is smaller and currently tends to focus mostly on spacecraft and controls. There are a few professors who work outside of this doing amazing work, but there's aren't as many. Because of GTAE's larger size, they have more work going on. It's not easy to get into Stanford post-grad even coming from a good school like GT. I think I saw about 5 GT students at the Stanford visit day. 

Both schools have good industry ties, with GT focusing more on traditional aerospace industry, and Stanford having better connections to Silicon Valley. The entrepreneurial spirit is huge at Stanford, far more than at Tech. 

Outside of AE, Stanford has more diverse academic offerings. GT's main focus is on engineering and it shows across all the schools. Stanford has a wider range of options with especially good sciences, the med school, policy research, and CS/AI/ML. 

Atlanta and Palo Alto are also totally different cities. At Stanford the culture tends to focus more around campus more than GT. It's campus is way larger and I think prettier than Tech's. Since Tech is in the middle of Atlanta there's a ton more to do than in Palo Alto. Definitely visit both and think about how you'd enjoy both of their campuses.

comments,"ECE 3710 is a hit or miss depending on your TA. The professor for that class is always Harris but it's more like a flipped classroom setup so you'll never see the prof. You'll have to watch short lecture videos at home and then go over problems and do the labs in-class with the TA.  Overall, the class isn't too demanding so it shouldn't be an issue.

I took ISYE 3770 instead of BMED 2400 so I can't provide much insight on that class. I do know that MATLAB is used to work out problems for the BMED version. Since you took statistics in high school, you probably have a good baseline exposure which should help with the concepts. 

If you enjoy chem and are good at it then CHEM 1212k should be manageable. If you're more of a physics person and chem isn't your strong suit, I would push off BMED 2400 to the next semester since it's not a pre-req for that many core BMED classes and it would give you more time to focus on chem. 

Like you said, BMED 2250 is a huge time drain. You should be ready to spend time with you group outside of the scheduled class time. The professor isn't really a huge factor since you're being graded by a group of TAs as well as the professor. 

Is the 10 hrs/week research for the summer or fall? If it's summer, that schedule is fine. If it's for the fall, that could be a lot to handle on top of the courses you're planning on taking. ",positive,0.9813,positive,0.3426315789473685,04/02/2019

Is this doable?

So I took 2110 last semester and withdrew on the drop date so I still have good knowledge from maybe the first third of the class (mega flunked assembly, did well with circuits), and have taken discrete math and algorithms already so was hoping there would be decent overlap for combinatorics. Also considering adding MUSI 4630 (recording and mixing) or swapping it with stats if I get into the music tech minor. So if anyone could attest to that class' workload that would be great.

comments,"It's interesting that you post this - yesterday I was walking on campus and witnessed two separate groups of (clearly inexperienced) people on scooters on the sidewalk on Techwood, then a few minutes later watched a scooter in the bike lane on Techwood and paralleling him in the street was another scooter riding in the oncoming traffic lane, cars stopping for him as he swerved to the sidewalk and finally, I looked down at my phone, looked up and from behind a scooter brushed by me. I have no idea where he came from but he must have been on the sidewalk the whole time and blended into the cars? 

The point is there are lots of people and traffic on campus. Yes, pedestrians need to be aware and get their heads out of their phones, but skateboarders, bicyclists, scooter jockeys, facilities carts, golf carts, construction equipment and automobiles are everywhere and mostly moving faster (and inherently with more momentum) than a pedestrian. Also, campus is full of people new to the area (like the scooter gangs I saw) and traffic just passing through. ",positive,0.5423,positive,0.11291486291486288,04/03/2019

However, right now we’re learning stuff that I’ve never learned before and I’m so lost, and I know I’m not the only one. I’m pretty sure even the TAs think she’s pretty bad at teaching. The only time I ever learn new stuff is if I read the textbook or go to recitation. Another teacher is also teaching this class, and for the second test that teacher’s class average was around 10 points higher than ours. We did have different tests, so I’m not sure if that test was easier or not... I don’t know much about McDaniel, so I don’t know if it would be a better idea to take the class with them instead.

McDaniels has the teaching experience. I thought she did great for 1301 but those on ratemyprofessor are mixed on her. I think either option would be good. 

As a complete speculation I would think McDaniels would be a better teacher for someone not interested in becoming a professional in the field/someone not knowledgeable of Java.

Very much disagree with you and your ideas, but without them, I'm sure the more cancerous elements of my own ideology would grow too strong; just as the same can be said of yours. The Left and Right need each other - as through our centuries-long struggle, the middle ground is created. I'll never be a centrist, but I can certainly concede that neither side should ever be in complete control of the country.

comments,"**Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China**

Reports of organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners and other political prisoners in China have raised increasing concern by some groups within the international community. According to the reports, political prisoners, mainly Falun Gong practitioners, are being executed ""on demand"" in order to provide organs to recipients. The organ harvesting is said to be taking place both as a result of the Chinese Communist Party's persecution of Falun Gong and because of the financial incentives available to the institutions and individuals involved in the trade.

Reports on systematic organ harvesting from Falun Gong prisoners first emerged in 2006, though the practice is thought by some to have started six years earlier.

comments,"Hey there, welcome (maybe) to Tech. I'll list a few classes that I think you might want to check out, different whether you're a prospective Math or CS major below:

**Math** (listed in order of class number)

* MATH 2106 (Foundations of Mathematical Proofs) - Almost all the high-level math classes you're going to take (and theory classes if you become a CS major) are going to be very very proof-based. To the point where you barely do computations anymore, except to complement a proof. This class teaches how to layout a proof. (12:20 pm - 1:10 pm, Skiles 254, [Professor's Page](https://people.math.gatech.edu/~zengch/))
* MATH 3102 (Applied Combinatorics) - Combinatorics, teaching you how to count in ways that will be practical in almost any field. Required class for both Math and CS majors. (11:15 am - 12:05 pm, Klaus 2447, Professor's Email: cassiekierzkowski@gatech.edu)
* MATH 4032 (Combinatorial Analysis) - Advanced combinatorics for math majors, a lot more proof-based, a lot less calculations. (1:55 pm - 2:45 pm, Skiles 249, [Professor's Page](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~jyu67/))
* MATH 4107 (Abstract Algebra) - Core Requirement for all Math majors and for a lot of math majors, teaches the core of how you think about math (12:20 pm - 1:10 pm, Skiles 367, [Professor's Page](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~iliev/))
* MATH 4150 (Intro to Number Theory) - Name is kind of self-explanatory, but the class also assumes heavy knowledge of proofs and other mathematical fields. (11:15 pm - 12:05 pm, Skiles 202, [Professor's Page](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~mbaker/))

**CS** (listed in order of class number):

* CS 1331 (Intro to Object-Oriented Programming in Java) - The core, intro to Java/programming class. Helpful if you understand Java before you come in, but of course it'll teach you Java if not. (12:20 pm - 1:10 pm, IC 103, [Professor's Page](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/suzy-watson-phillips))
* CS 1332 (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms in Java) - Typically your first ""real"" programming class. Teaches you about a lot of common data structures and how to implement them yourself from scratch. (1:55 pm - 2:45 pm, Howey L3, [Professor's Page](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/mary-hudachek-buswell))
* CS 2050 (Intro to Discrete Math for CS) - Introduction to Discrete Logic for CS majors. A lot of boolean true/false logic. (11:15 am - 12:05 pm, IC 103, [Professor's Page](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sweat/))
* CS 2340 (Objects and Design) - Implementation of Object-Oriented programming, typically using Android Studio to develop an app using a Model-View-Controller model (11:15 am - 12:05 pm, Klaus 1456, [Professor's Page](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~simpkins/))
* CS 3510 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) - Learning a lot of advanced algorithm methods and thinking processes (12:20 pm - 1:10 pm, Klaus 1456, [Professor's Page](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Constantinos.Dovrolis/))

Personally, I'd probably try to hit MATH 3102 (Applied Combinatorics), MATH 4107 (Abstract Algebra), CS 1332 (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms) to get a nice mix of math and CS classes. MATH 3102 is still mostly computation, so it'll probably be more familiar. MATH 4107 shows you a glimpse into a bit more advanced mathematics, and CS 1332 will show you what a coding class usually entails, at least for your first few semesters.

If you want to talk to me personally, I'll be in MATH 4150 (Intro to Number Theory) from 11:15 - 12:05, and I'd be open for questions. I entered as a Math major, transferred to CS, graduating soon^T^M",positive,0.9442,positive,0.1342142857142857,04/03/2019

Email only had  simple/standard header that said GT &amp; Office of Disability Services.

This  is worrisome b/c these docs include extensive information of my personal medical history...I can freeze my credit and take steps to protect my identity  without too much hassle as I've had to do many times in my life, but the  idea of my detailed,  private medical information being potentially compromised b/c of GT makes my stomach churn a bit.

I've  notified GT and given them images of the emails as a precaution, but  I'm not sure if this is linked to the actual breach or if it's more  likely something random I received due to system errors while GT  attempts to fix this?? If anybody has any thoughts on this, I'd really  appreciate your advice!!! Thanks so much!!

&amp;#x200B;

Minus my personal info, this is what the body of the emails look like:

\[Dear: Name Name\]

\[Your 1 has been approved:\]

Don't know how she is with Java, but I really liked her teaching style with Python as she made everything very clear to someone with little programming experience prior to the class. Her lectures were a low pressure environment yet I learned a lot, and she truly cares for us and wanted each and every one of us to learn Python, be able to apply the skills, and enjoy the class. The only thing is that her test/homework grading at least for Python was a bit tough (which may be why her ratings aren't the highest on RMP), but I definitely have seen and even experienced way worse. My roommate is in 1331 with Watson now and I haven't heard too many good things about her, though from what I've heard it isn't *that* bad and definitely doable.

Those issues went incredibly fast and generated a ton of reaction, including a few dirty looks from Chinese students (one student picked up a magazine from us while tabling, then made a display out of walking to the end of Skiles Walkway and tossing it in the trash). One student organization also reportedly (according to a secondhand report) discussed the magazine how ""offensive"" the magazine was at a general meeting.

But there were no pitchforks or flash mobs. We also heavily monitored stands for [newspaper theft](https://splc.org/newspaper-theft-resources/) due to the high pickup rate we were seeing, but found no evidence of theft from Chinese students. Instead we found most of the increased pickup came from the greek community, after a member brought one of the magazines to an IFC board meeting.

Whereas your first project that you'll be assigned within the first few weeks and will be given 2 weeks to complete is to build an entire working mini 32-bit computer, using their custom ISA and specifications for that semester.

comments,"It's an issue of inclusion.  Those with special needs are already a very marginalized group in our society, and relegating Excel students to a separate commencement implies that they are second-class.

The nature of the Excel program is very much unlike that of other certificate programs (eg coding bootcamp or six sigma courses) as they live on-campus for four years, attend classes at other colleges within GT, and participate in regular GT events.  It is intended in every way to be a typical college experience - even in tuition, as the program costs roughly the same as that of an in-state student.

Personally, I am so unhappy with this decision that, unless it is reversed, I doubt I will walk when I graduate this fall.  Administration doesn't want Excel students to walk as it ""devalues the degree"", but by discriminating against special needs students, I feel they've already devalued my degree.",positive,0.8428,neutral,0.016165223665223674,04/04/2019

comments,"I'm still trying to work it all out for myself, so let me know if I've got it wrong...It sounds like there's a conflict between relative achievement and absolute achievement.

As you described it, Excel was intended to mimic the traditional undergraduate experience in every way, best preparing its students for life after college (including technical skills and knowledge) and pushing them just as hard as traditional students are pushed. In that case, clearly the relative achievements (who we are at graduation relative to who we were the first day freshman year) of Excel students and traditional students are roughly on par with each other. If undergraduate commencement is about recognizing that growth, then clearly Excel students would be worthy of walking at commencement.

It sounds like Georgia Tech views undergraduate commencement as a recognition of absolute achievement as defined by bachelor's degree requirements. In that case, it's obvious that Excel students should not walk at commencement because they did not fulfill undergraduate degree requirements (nor are they expected to).
Maybe commencement has been already defined in the way GT has said (I would bet so, but I don't know). In that case, maybe we as students need to push GT to define commencement in a new way, if the majority of students agree with that position.",positive,0.9679,positive,0.08515151515151513,04/04/2019

I am looking back at it now, I think Cornell had a more solid class set for ECE then GT. Here we have alot of good classes that come and go, and some that don't teach us what we need to know. That being said. The location, the research, the job opportunities, and resources at GT blew me away. Between places like the invention studio and hive, VIP research, OARS research, CreateX, and more. GT is great if you are willing to come in, ask questions, and talk to your professors, and make connections to get what you want. the more time you put into GT the more you are gonna get out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

While cornell is bueatiful, it is far from alot of stuff and isolated and because of that I had the same feel with the classes, its a little bit more controlled and structured and planned out if that makes sense. They didnt have as large of selection of classes and electives in your degree requirements, seems like less space to explore and specialize.

comments,"1. Tech is a hard school. A lot of freshman take it easy their first semester and suffer the consequences. But you shouldn’t spend all your time studying either. Maintaining a good work-life balance is one of the most important things you will learn at tech.

2. Maybe this is on the website, but whatever. Instead of a bell to signal class changes we’ve got a big steam whistle. Not sure why, but I really like that.

3. There’s a club for pretty much anything you might be interested, so I’d say go with the one that sounds the most fun. Personally I’d recommend Gamer’s Guild, the tabletop/board game club. There’s also the professional clubs which can be useful for gaining skills and networking.

4. I also went to a really small high school in the north (not Maine, but nearby) and it’s a big transition. Most classes you’ll be taking freshman year have hundreds of people in them, so the professor won’t be giving much attention to any individual person. Office hours can help with this, but it’s still not at all like high school. Another change is the students. Even if you were the smartest, most dedicated kid in his high school, he won’t be at Tech. Everyone is smart and everyone is working hard. That’s one of the best things about tech, but it can be jarring for some people.

1. IE is a lot of math, like A LOT. Make sure you enjoy math before committing to IE. Do not underestimate Georgia Tech. The student culture, the time-consuming classes, the soul-ripping exams make GT a down-right depressing place at times. Remember to come in with a good attitude and a humble mindset. Learn to ask for help. Learn to make the first step (in making friendships, or acquainting with your professors). GT is not like your high school. You can't slack off and expect great results. 
2. I know I listed the student culture as a negative above, but it is also one of the great pluses of GT. While competitive, I have not experienced the type of cut-throat competitiveness often heard at other high-ranking engineering schools. The students here sympathize with each other (since we're all suffering together). Help is everywhere. Everyone (most of them, at least) is ready to help, you just gotta reach out. 
3. I don't have any suggestion for clubs per se, but as a tip, get involved in the small things. Living in freshmen dorms is a great way to make friends. No one is going to force you into a friendship. You gotta make the effort yourself, which I realize can be very uncomfortable for us introverts. Show up to events, start greeting people in the hallway, make small talks. Overtime, you'll become friends with them. 
4. Yes, I did. I lived in a small town prior to coming to GT. Since GT has like its own little community, it wasn't that big of a transformation. I actually love that not everyone know everyone here.

2) find a group to support you academically. Business fraternities and professional organizations (like IISE) can provide good study partners and references when it comes time to look for internships/co-ops/employment

comments,"Everyone saying anywhere in midtown is 100% safe - that's just not true, at least in my experience/how I perceive safety. it's safer than home park but I wouldn't say it's safer than living in on campus housing. I've lived on campus, in sq5, and in uhouse, and I really felt unsafe many times walking to uhouse later at night or early in the morning. Sq5 feels infinitely safer than uhouse, but perception isn't always reality. I just know that that extra few blocks walking either behind NCR where there's no people or in front of the cheetah where there's more people but they're a bit sketchy at night made me feel more unsafe than any other moments in my sheltered few years at tech. Sq5 and uhouse may have the same safety in terms of crime reports because they're so close together, but I felt so so much safer at sq5. Things as seemingly insignificant as where the entrance is located/which street it faces/how well it's lit, how many layers of scanning in it takes to get from the street to your room, stores around the building, etc affect how safe you feel just as much as geographical location. I will repeat that I'm sheltered and stepping around homeless people sleeping on the staircase up to the gates of uhouse is scary. Uhouse and sq5 are both safe but if you're looking for relatively safety, sq5 feels infinitely safer. ",positive,0.9603,positive,0.10454545454545455,04/05/2019

I can't really speak for academics but I think they are both excellent and both are known to be extremely rigorous and difficult. Remember that while the purpose of graduate school is to get the absolute best training and research, the undergraduate experience involves a lot of personal growth so the student experience really matters. Rice really understands this and does a lot to make the undergrad experience the best possible. It's a small school that has a really strong residential college culture that makes it feel even smaller. You'll make really good friends. Professors will give you as much attention as you want and you can begin participating in research labs as early as your first semester. You'll have equally excellent job opportunities at either one and if you plan on going to graduate school, both schools will carry a lot of weight. The biggest thing I would consider is student life because I hear life at Georgia tech can be somewhat lonely and isolated whereas at Rice you are constantly surrounded by people who want to know you and be your friend.

From what I have gathered: Honors Program is sorta classy to talk about with outsiders who think it's an actual program within a college and not an LLC, and it also lets you into classes that are hard to get into. Grand Challenges is a lot about the community building aspect and you end the program with a cool project and a bunch of close friends. Global Leadership is Grand Challenges but global and the project lasts one semester and you take some GL approved classes the other semester. SMART and SHARP are their own niche groups. Don't know much about them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if that doesn't concern you, joining an LLC guarantees that you won't be living in Smith unless something crazy happens like your assigned room gets flooded or burns down.

I came back to Tech to do my masters, I will say this, the undergrad curriculum seems weaker and way less flexible then when I started.  One thing I continue to like about the ECE/CompE side of things is you can pick something like 20 hours of  3000 and 4000 level courses in either CS or ECE. If you decide you want to fill those hours with CS course I recommend you sign up for the CS minor so you can get permits quicker to sign up for courses.

comments,"Hey u/darrylkid! I think you share a lot predicaments with many other students when deciding between CompE &amp; CS and as a 4th year myself, please take my thoughts with a grain of salt.

So I've known a lot a people who've regretted not switching to CS for many of the reasons in that [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/8ygvio/false_advertising_georgia_tech_computer/). Reasons mainly including:

* Lack of certain courses
* Difficulty in getting into CS courses

However, I would say most people who switched to CS realised that they were simply more interested in CS stuff later on (SWE, ML, AI, Data Structures, etc.) For processor stuff, CS definitely offers better and more courses than CompE, but CompE's can always take OS/processor courses as electives (Especially since the new ECE 3057 now satisfies some CS preqs).

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, it sounds like you're also interested in low-level HW stuff (VLSI, Digital IC, etc.), so I would recommend CompE and trying to take CS classes for OS/processors. It really just depends how much you'd rather learn about low-level physical HW stuff vs other CS topics (SWE, ML, AI, etc.). 

&amp;#x200B;

Just remember to keep an open mind going into college. As you progress through your 4/5 years at Tech, you'll learn and experience a lot, which may very well change your plans. Your career aspirations may totally pivot. Stay open. Be flexible. Ultimately, a CompE vs CS degree won't totally define your future unless you let it.

comments,"Hey! I graduated last year from GT as a CompE, and I was also in the same position as you when I first started at GT. 

In general, if you want to work in the VLSI/Comp Arch field, you'll almost certainly need a graduate degree. In order to work on really interesting problems, you'll most likely need a PhD, although you may be able to get by with an MS + experience.

I would recommend being majoring in CS sys arch + devices. The CompE curriculum is rather weak at the moment, although from what I hear, it's improving. The CS classes are much better imo, at least when I was there. Data structures + algorithms are very important to know, and the CompE class that taught it (ECE 3020) didn't do a very good job and came relatively late in my academic career, whereas from what I heard, CS 1332 was very comprehensive. In addition, there was no class on Operating Systems in ECE (the CS one wasn't very good either but at least it existed). Another strange thing is CS 3220, a processor design class, is a CS class not cross listed with ECE.

In addition, it's exactly like what you said: if you find that you don't really enjoy this field and want to go into software engineering, you'll be at a major disadvantage compared to those who studied CS. I'd also say to skip CompE with a CS minor, the time to get a CS minor can be better spent. 

So in summary, my recommendation is to go CS Sys Arch + Devices. Check out the different subfields in CS, do internships, and find out what you like doing. Your interests may turn out to be different than what they are now, which is completely fine, but as a CS major you'll have the flexibility to pursue a career in any area you want.

This becomes very evident when you apply to jobs/ schools/internships/etc. because the demands of the honors program are simply not on par with that of other schools. 

On the other hand, taking a look at people from grand challenges, these students are allowed most luxuries of the honors program such as enrolling in the courses the honors program has to offer while also completing a project that gets visibility from professors across campus. Grand challenges also does a very nice job in connecting freshman students to the important faculty that conduct their research of interest, are within their department, or have walked similar paths of lives as them. 

Our alumni have gone on to do incredible things as well which I’m sure is just as valid for the honors program. ",positive,0.9927,positive,0.3229411764705883,04/06/2019

comments,"That's an understandable concern, but the reality is that there aren't very many classes that you'll be missing out on as a CS major. I actually did not end up getting the chance to take any VLSI classes (either not offered or heard very bad things about the classes). Even then, one or two classes doesn't really make or break a career. Most likely you'll end up taking maybe one or two VLSI class in your last or second last semester, at which point you'll already have a full time job lined up and the class wouldn't really help you in getting a job. 

This also means that what major you pick is not as important as you think. What matters more is the experience and skills you obtain, either from research or from internships. You'll really be ok either way, as a CS or CompE. 

I'm actually in grad school now. My classmates and labmates did their undergrad in some form of EE/CS/CompE, which goes to show that the exact major doesn't matter that much. I wouldn't say I have been very hindered in any way by picking CompE, but I feel that I've had to play catch up on learning some CS concepts.

A raspberry pi on the other hand is a full fledged computer. You can use it as a server, or even a desktop.

Stanford as well as Berkeley professors (which aren’t no one I would think) that I interviewed with had many great things to say about the GT Grand Challenges program and in fact told me that the honors program was a waste of time and they decided to go with those that participated in impactful grand challenges projects over the “prestige and praise” of the honors program. 

Ultimately what it will come down to is what kind of people you would like to live with your freshman year.

Her tests were considerably harder than the practice tests and homeworks and I literally almost dropped out of EE after I thought I bombed her second test. I ended up getting an 82 but it was because she took off 15 points when I did everything right except accidentally using 5 when substituting in for capacitance instead of 1/5.

Now this may partially be because 2040 was my first ECE course, and if you have taken 2026 it would definitely be easier. But I still feel Ansari is a lower end professor and would have had a better experience if I took Zhang which I've heard good things about.

Hey!  I used to live on Charles Allen Drive between 9th St and 10th St for 3 years and relied on a bike to get to/from GT daily, so I can totally relate to this.

Suuuuper easy with a bike, especially now that 10th St has the cycle track.  Zero worries about traffic of anything. I alternated routes depending on what I was feeling - to GT, I would go Charles Allen northbound-10 St-Myrtle-5th-Tech Square or Charles Allen southbound-6th-Argonne-5th-Tech Square.  On the way home, I typically went straight 5th-Charles Allen or Tech Square-W Peachtree-6th-Peachtree-8th-Charles Allen.  Those routes I mentioned (with the exception of Peachtree St) have either bike lanes or are not particularly heavily traveled roads.

I wonder if switching into Kippelen is a good idea or if I should try out the flipped class structure for the professor.

I also heard that Lanterman is amazing, but can be scatter minded and even crazy at times. For anyone that has had him before how was the experience? Would switching into Wardi be a good idea? Also, Lanterman does specialize in DSP which is a field of interest for me, while Wardi's specialization Controls and Systems isn't something I want to go into.

comments,"&gt; Did being far(ther) away from campus have any downsides or benefits to it?

Good question.  I think I *personally* benefited from it.  I was on campus freshman year and very active in a couple clubs on campus so between housing, clubs, classes, and friends-of-friends, I always had a really good social life.  I also lived with either 1 or 2 fellow Tech students who were some of my closest friends and participated in the same clubs.  Anyway - point being, I participated in campus life despite being off campus but I also was really involved at the time with other communities in Atlanta, so I had a good chunk of non-Tech friends who/non-Tech events that were super accessible via the Beltline.  Very fond memories of hitting up friends and/or roommates for random midnight party-pace rides after hours of studying and homework.  I think being east of 85/75 helped me spend a lot more time outside the Tech bubble than I otherwise would have.  Also, living on Charles Allen was way closer to cheap groceries (Kroger) and, for the later years, bars.  Not sure where you are exactly from the description but having all the Piedmont Park festivals and music festivals right outside our front stoop was super cool and lively.

&gt; Also, what did you do on rainy days? I'm thinking biking will offset the cost of Uber.

I rode 100% of the time.  If it was raining in the afternoon/evening, I sometimes waited it out on campus hanging with friends at our clubs or at the CULC hanging out/getting work done.  I was also a poor college undergrad though, so YMMV...I'm definitely less gungho about biking in the rain at this point in my life.

I will say that for my undergrad experience, I generally scheduled classes in a way where I could wake up in the morning and packed my backpack with class materials, potential homework to work on, and gym clothes/toiletries (the last year and a half) to stay on campus from my first class through 5 or 6pm, sometimes til midnight or later.  It's only a 10ish minute bike ride but only rarely did I round trip it twice in one day.

Not sure if you're currently an avid cyclist or just plan to commute for now, but if fun group bike rides for beers interest you, private message me and I'm happy to invite you to them and be your first friend when you get to ATL.

comments,"For Grand Challenges, there's a 3-credit-hour course in the Fall and the Spring. So one class on Tuesday and one on Thursday. The classes are usually relevant to problem solving or just working on projects, there isn't really ""homework"" or ""classwork"" per se. The classes themselves aren't terribly time consuming.

 The majority of the coursework is figuring out what your project is going to be, which can vary a lot depending on what kind of problem space you choose. My project has to do with Digital Information, but other topics include Infrastructure, Health, Education, etc. You have a good bit of freedom with this, though you have to pitch your ideas right. Your mileage may vary, but that goes for almost any class.

Here's some current projects: [http://grandchallenges.gatech.edu/projects](http://grandchallenges.gatech.edu/projects)

To be honest, Glenn and Towers basically win across the board when it comes to physical dorm quality, because they were extensively renovated very recently. However, I personally wouldn't change my decision, because the best time spent at Tech isn't going to be sitting around in your dorm room.

comments,"Hey! First year here at Tech just a year and a half removed from the trauma known as college apps. 

The best advice I can give is to not to try to impress admissions officers. Ever since coming to college, I learned that your essays really aren't about boasting about your academic achievements; those should be outlined in your resume, letter of recommendations, transcript, activities list, etc. What colleges and universities are really looking for is if you would fit in the environment of the school. In the case of Tech, admissions officers are looking in your essay if you are well suited for, or at least have the potential to be adapt to, the stressful and hardworking environment of Tech. So try not to talk too much about your accomplishments; they should be secondary in your essays. Instead, have a forward looking mindset and discuss more about how your past experiences helped you grow into the person you are now, and how that will affect you going forward. In addition, be yourself in the essays; it really does matter. It makes your essays much more personal and your admissions officer would get to know you as a person better, as that is what they are truly looking for, people that would fit in with the Tech culture.

Another very important factor is keeping your essays positive. This was my big mistake in college apps. I went through two major depressive phases around the college apps time, one from March to September 2017 and the other from October all the way up to graduation. I had a couple of weeks in between these two phases where I felt that my depression was over, and I wrote essays for two college apps during that time period, Tech and UIUC. In the end, I got rejected from every institution I applied to with the exception of Tech and UIUC. While this may be a mere coincidence, I feel like my negative mindset while writing my essays greatly contributed to me not getting in. You may not notice it, but the essays you write while being unhappy can carry a subtle negative and hopeless tone to it and in my case, place more weight on my past failures than what I learned from it. So I'd say unless you have to, write your essays when you aren't in a bad mood or are feeling hopeless about the future. You don't necessarily have to be feeling great to write a forward looking positive essay, but try not to pick a too stressful time to write your essays. I'd say summer would be a good time, since you probably have more time to focus on writing your applications and don't have schoolwork to worry about.

Best of luck on your applications and hope you get in! If you want any further advice or questions about the application process and/or Tech feel free to dm!",positive,0.9426,positive,0.14785476718403545,04/06/2019

comments,"I was just thinking about adding an edit to my previous post about this.  I'm really not even sure what he paid, it never came up in conversation.  My point was really just that the accounting difference presents a speedbump to registration that might not be otherwise obvious.

Talking to Scheller couldn't hurt, but you're not one of their students and they usually need approval from the prof/department anyway especially to waive prereqs.  I'd guess that reaching directly to the prof. is probably going to be much more efficient.

In general, evening classes/profs are probably going to be much more flexible too but it depends on the class.

comments,"I had to make this same choice 4 years ago, and I never regretted choosing Tech over Cornell. As far as I've seen, when it comes to engineering the Ivies have no real benefit over schools with distinguished engineering programs. I don't know if the studies have been done recently, but back in 2014-2015, Forbes created a list of the best graduates as ranked by employers. The school that topped that list was none other than Georgia Tech. I have also seen many of my fellow classmates work at companies like Apple, Intel, SpaceX, NASA, Tesla, and more. 

I would also recommend you consider the price of the school before making your decision. This is what ended up being my deciding factor, as OOS tuition was around $20k cheaper per year than Cornell. $80k is more than the average starting salary of an engineer graduating from either school, and you should consider whether there is enough of a difference between the two to warrant a massive increase in price.

Also, there's a mandatory retreat after the first week of classes in the fall, which was fun, but probably not worth the extra money to be in this. They do host a wide variety of events, which are sometimes frequented by students, but I didn't really find them too useful or appealing.

comments,"Not OP but I'll give my two cents as well.

1) Hopefully you have some idea of the field you would like to be in. Tech has fantastic engineering, science, math, and business programs. If you are interested in studying liberal arts and exploring a wide range of fields, this might not be the best place for you, though you still would have some options to work with.

2) I have made many valuable connections at GT that have opened doors with top companies. Many of our professors have been leaders in industry, and relationships with them have personally opened up high paying, high prestige job opportunities. I'm not sure how an 'ivy' connection helps more than that.

3) Though I can't compare to a Cornell class, our classes do range in size. Many freshman level classes operate in lecture halls of over 200 students. But once you get to the higher levels of your degree, especially grad school, class sizes shrink dramatically.

4) If you are interested in a social scene, choose to dorm on east campus freshman year, and go greek thereafter. Additionally, some majors like Biomedical engineering are majority female.

5) I believe this one has to do a lot with location. Many, many tech students are Georgia natives, and will return to Georgia to be with their families following graduation. Georgia has lower average salaries for engineering compared to other areas like the west coast or nyc. But for the rest of us, I have had no problem securing offers well over six figures from nyc and seattle. Ultimately, Tech will open doors for you, but you must put in the work to get what you want from there.",positive,0.988,positive,0.2029012345679012,04/07/2019

5. Reviewing notes/slides/practice tests for tests

That 5 step plan above has saved me more times than I can count!

As for retaking the class, keep in mind summer semesters are super condensed and so can be more difficult (I.e. many people take way less hours). However, by waiting for 1331 in the Fall, you wouldn’t take 1332 until the Spring.

But do not worry, a lot of upper level CS classes do teach us information at a reasonable rate and do not expect us to have an inordinate amount of free time to learn the content on our own. Put in the time, but trust that classes get more reasonable.

TLDR: cs students come in with differing levels of knowledge, and this class is too easy for some and near impossible for others. On a more level playing field, CS classes are not this hard.",positive,0.9573,positive,0.12509259259259264,04/08/2019

comments,"Hey, I'm a 4th year CM major and the vice president of the VG Dev club here at Tech, so if you have any other questions, you can ask me.

Besides what others have told you, it's important to note that Tech isn't a trade school or fine arts; very few classes are going to directly teach you industry tools. Fortunately, a notable exception to this is CS4455 Video Game Design, where you are taught how to use Unity (as the class is now).

The LMC side of the CM degree is fairly capricious—what you learn in your LMC classes is almost entirely dependent on who's teaching it, and you can frequently be in classes where it's the professors first time teaching it (i.e. they'll be working out kinks in real time). Taking LMC4725 Game Design with one professor could have you making games that mechanically engage with race, gender, and political topics, while another could have you focus on creating mainly aesthetic interactions.

Conversely CS is largely unwavering (possibly to the point of being boring). You'll probably come out learning what you expected to learn, but you might not find the topics very interesting (your milage will obviously vary depending on how neat you think graph theory or software architecture is).

I'm biased, but [VGDev](http://vgdev.gtorg.gatech.edu/) is probably the single greatest place to learn how to actually *make* games. Your classes will usually be either too abstract (CS) or too experimental (LMC) to actually get a solid game done, so between classes is when you can put your knowledge to better use. In VGDev we focus on getting games done; 4-7 games per semester. Here, you'd be able to network, learn from your peers, and just get stuff done without the stress of being graded for it. No matter what school you choose to attend, I'd recommend getting involved in a game dev club on top of any academics. It'll probably be more rewarding than most of your academics.",positive,0.9859,positive,0.12037001287001288,04/08/2019

comments,"&gt;  the fact that I'd be able to interact with humanities majors as well as stem majors

That just made me lol. 

We have multiple colleges for the liberal arts, if you want to interact with people who do humanities it's not hard. You're also required to take a certain number of humanities and social science courses as part of your gen ed requirements. You could get a minor in one of them if you so choose. 

I did my degree in BME but did a minor out of the LMC school called [Health, Medicine, and Society.](https://www.gatech.edu/academics/degrees/bachelors/health-medicine-and-society-minor). So uh I don't think I missed out on the 'liberal arts' education but I also think that term is mostly irrelevant. 

Social life and greek life is what you make of it - outside of Greek Week it doesn't have to be in your face really, though most of fraternities physically exist on east campus so you'll see all the houses and walk through greek row routinely and they will have parties on weekends. I was greek, but had plenty of friends who were and were not. Greek life at Tech I feel is different than at other schools and fits our more academic / nerdy lives. Not sure if you're male or female, but I'd encourage everyone to at least rush or recruit - you don't have to join. But it's a good way to meet people. 

I know people who have gone onto both grad school and industry, or even both lol. You can write your own ticket, pretty much. 

I have no idea what ignite is but my sister was admitted to the summer semester and she did very well. I think she benefitted from it. 

Tech is hard, but everyone around you is going through the same crap. Make liberal and early use of all the many tutoring options available to you. Treat your school like a 9-5 job with overtime. Your academics have to come first, but not at the total exclusion of sleep or social life. 

At any point in time I think 1 in 5 kids is cooping also. We're the largest voluntary coop school in the country. That directly led to me getting the other jobs I've held since. 

As someone who's from Georgia and went to Tech and now lives in Indiana... the weather is a lifestyle and you should give it a considerable thought. Shouldn't be your make or break...

Had they been the same price I mightve chosen UofM but I’m also a huge wimp when it comes to the cold. 


I love that Gatech’s campus is in Atlanta and there’s always stuff to do in he city but UofM’s campus is unbeatable. Ann Arbor is an amazing city with tons of great bars, shops and restaurants and I love the way the campus is integrated with the city. Also I would’ve liked to go to a school that wasn’t so STEM dominant. Despite what the other comment said as a STEM major it’s very rare I ever meet someone who isn’t also STEM and I feel like the college experience is a little different here just because the student population isn’t as diverse Major wise as it is as UofM. I haven’t personally been in the dining halls or dorms at UofM but I’d imagine they’re both better than the dorms and dining halls at tech since the school has a fuckton of Money, but that would only really impact u the first year as moving off campus and buying your own food is the way to go at tech. Also while Tech’s name and reputation is incredibly well-respected, it’s really hard to beat UofM’s reputation. 

Last thing though if you haven’t experienced Michigan in the winter you’ll be in for a surprise. Winters are long and unbearably cold.

comments,"gtg here, started in 2004. Several months ago I came across this old but relevant Technique article that sheds light on the history of GT accounts (PDF warning):

[GT numbers: why I’m gtg and you’re gte](https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/7880/2003-08-22_focus.pdf?sequence=3)

I think one of the more interesting peices of information has to do with why GT took so long to start using actual names in account usernames:

*... one of the most frequent complaints raised against OIT is that GT account numbers are too ugly and impersonal.*

*Why, the argument goes, aren’t students given more personal
user IDs, as is the case at some other schools?*

*One of the primary reasons ... is that Georgia Tech introduced the system so early that the technology at the time did not allow it...*

*Georgia Tech ... employed UNIX to satisfy its networking needs. “Up until just a few months ago, user names on a Unix box could only be up to 8 characters...We had to fit in that limitation.”*

Personally, I like(d) my semi-anonymous gtg account, not necessarily for that reason, but it did, imo, impart a sense of camaraderie but also uniqueness that name+number doesn't. By my time, you already had to learn your 901# since SSNs were completely phased out. So taking on your gt account helped complete the immersion like feeling of joining the GT community. They also did impart an implicit indicator of seniority, which isn't such a bad thing when you might want to quickly judge someone's level of experience with the in and outs of campus life relative to your own, especially at a school with such a notable 5th and 6th year population.",positive,0.9772,positive,0.12123655913978496,04/08/2019

I'd say look at the syllabuses for each class if you can find them (I think I was able to find them well before I took classes last summer) and hopefully they'll give you a good idea of how much work you'll have.

comments,"I work a lot with embedded systems and personally I think that the low-level software and hardware interface is where CompE in particular is well-suited. I actually do more reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis of existing things than development of new ones, but if I wasn't doing this I'd likely just be somewhere else doing embedded system development on some particular device/system in (since they're everywhere) literally about any existing industry (automotive/medical/aeronautic/industrial/military/consumer/entertainment).

Of course you can go in other directions like chip design or something if you really like VLSI. Or maybe FPGA design/manufacture. Going into telecom is pretty common. Overall though, classmates wound up at a wide variety of companies and jobs and, like most majors, you have a decent amount of latitude deciding where you end up by recognizing and focusing on the areas of that major that you enjoy and interest you. For me that was the areas of microcontrollers, discrete embedded systems, low-level software (assembly), communications, and putting my hands on PCBs in the lab.

comments,"Last time I heard the average time was 5.9 years.  \[This means that 50% of the students take LONGER than this.......I was right at 6 years.\]

3-4 years of that is all that is strictly necessary to get the PhD (military students do it in 3-4 years depending upon what the deadlines are from their service branch).  If you intend to go out into industry you may also be able to do it in 4 years, IF your faculty advisor is on board.

&amp;#x200B;

The extra 2 year are doing more research, racking up more publications, and networking at conferences, getting ready to get a faculty job. In the CS field, it is not as common to do post-docs between your PhD and getting a faculty position as in other fields. So the PhD program is longer, and you are being prepared to go right into a faculty position.

&amp;#x200B;

Getting a MS (elsewhere) may be a good idea, as it exposes you to different researchers/ideas, and makes your application better (assuming you can't get accepted straight from your BS program).    Plus, you may get more training in how to do research, write a MS Thesis, etc....it's like a mini-warmup to the PhD.  (Of course, if it's just a coursework masters, and you don't do a Thesis, it may not help much).

&amp;#x200B;

However, it probably won't speed up your progress in the PhD unless you find a way to continue on with the same research program/topic from the MS to PhD program. You may get some coursework waived due to the MS program, allowing you to do more research, but in general the coursework isn't what takes all your time in a PhD program, so the MS probably won't shorten your completion time by 2 years (possibly by one year if you get lucky).",positive,0.6287,positive,0.17819047619047615,04/08/2019

Although I think you should be proud of what you have accomplished(kicking addiction is badass, you obviously have a lot of determination for sticking out for a degree at a difficult university, there are SO MANY THINGS), I found that trying to appreciate my accomplishments meant nothing when I was depressed and I always could find a way to spin it in a negative way or tell myself I didn't deserve something in my life. It is cheesy, but I had to figure out how to love myself (well, it is a continual process), most importantly the shitty side of myself, before I started feeling better.

West campus dorms have larger rooms, usually a little older, a new food hall and close to CRC usually better community in dorms but a bit of a walk to campus.

East Campus, you have smaller rooms, but bigger common space. the food hall is old but all you can eat, and you only got to struggle up one not so nice hill to class. It is a little bit noisy and the community on the floor is not as strong since most of the dorm floors are larger and with the alot of kids go greek, so  are out of the dorm alot.

recommend: Matheson/Perry, Glenn/Towers and Hanson, and also heard great things about community in Cloudman + Mathson/Perry

I didn't like UMich because the roads + airport sucked to get back to FL, and it felt that the engineering College was far from the rest of the campus (I needed to take a 8-10 bus ride from the cool part of Ann Harbor to get there) 

Coming to GT, the college is smushed together in an amazing city, so you got the great culture of Atlanta off campus, and the tight knit buildings. 

Few other notes. 

\-30% or so go greek on campus but the pledge classes are getting smaller so it seems to becoming less popular 

\-I don't feel like there is anything missing in liberal arts. seems like we are embracing STEAM more here (see art hackathon and music engineering classes)

comments,"I'm not /u/ROMAN_CIPHER, but here's my take. You'll code plenty in CompE, but your software focus will be more on smaller, practical code base projects, usually specialized, usually limited in scope and smaller parts of larger systems. In other words, for a CompE, *software* itself is rarely the deliverable, rarely the end product. Assuming you have experience with them, think more Arduino sketches than GUI/Web Apps. If you're more interested in how or where computing allows you to sense, interact with, or otherwise affect the *physical* world, then CompE is a good fit.

If you find that you're more or primarily interested in higher level computing topics like  software *design* philosophy, (enterprise) software *development*, programming theory, algorithms, database structure, AI, machine learning, etc. then you'd be better served by CS.

As for cyber, the field is large enough where either are suited although with different areas of emphasis. With the ubiquity of cyber physical systems today, CompEs have plenty to do, but they would be more concerned with backdoors in a firmware update, than the C2 network of a botnet for instance. [Cyber security is now explicitly a focus area available in GT's CompE undergrad curriculum.](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/computer-engineering-degree#Cybersecurity)

All that said, as an incoming freshman, don't fret too much about it, you have time to switch afer taking some real classes and with electives, you can bend either major toward the other or a particular area of interest anyway. Your experience and knowledge will count much more than the letters CS or CmpE(official, less elegant, GT designation) on your resume. As long as you get one or the other, there are probably very few job listings that seek CompEs that won't also consider a qualified CS grad on that basis alone and vice-versa.

Cons - paid $400 to join, ""wrote"" an application (by recycling all my old college essays lol)
Pros - community, guaranteed nice housing for my time here at Tech, knowing some adults at Tech. The community is great (the retreat and subsequent events and the cafe/classroom are great ways to meet cool people and make friends) - it's one of those unexpected benefits I got from HP, and it really impacted me. I can't imagine what I'd be doing if I'd lived in Glenn or Towers. As for nice housing - sophomores can get shafted in registering for on-campus housing, and HP guarantees you a spot in the Crecine apartments, which is one of the better places. tbh I joined just for the housing. And for knowing adults - when you take HP classes, especially the HP GT1000, you meet professors and HP staff who can then write you recommendations when you apply for, say, becoming a PL or anything else that requires a professor reccomendation. It makes that a lot easier.

&gt;Georgia Tech information security officials are working to determine the extent of the access and to identify the individuals who may be affected.  
&gt;  
&gt;A central Georgia Tech database was accessed by an unknown outside entity. Georgia Tech’s cybersecurity team is conducting a thorough forensic investigation to determine precisely what information was extracted from the system, which may include names, addresses, social security numbers and birth dates.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.S. Department of Education and University System of Georgia have been notified, and those whose data was exposed will be contacted as soon as possible regarding available credit monitoring services.

Payment information was not stored in the data set that was exposed.  Furthermore, Georgia Tech will be releasing more specific information when it becomes available and affected individuals will be contacted directly with information about signing up for credit monitoring service.

Can't comment about the CoC breach, but I doubt it included payment information.  Have you ever provided the CoC with your debit card?

Also, I would consider getting a credit card because credit cards have better consumer protection laws than debit cards with regards to personal liability.  You can read more about the fraud protection benefits of a credit card over a debit card at  [https://lendedu.com/blog/credit-card-vs-debit-card-fraud-protection-online/](https://lendedu.com/blog/credit-card-vs-debit-card-fraud-protection-online/).

3) I will add that I, and all the CompEs I went to undergrad with, were under the 'old' CompE curriculum before it was re-jiggered a few years ago (and the state of CS would have been a little different back then too) and that I [found this thread where it seems that some recent CompEs feel like they would have been better off in CS](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/8ygvio/false_advertising_georgia_tech_computer/) so check that out for other perspectives and food for thought.

For me, changing my perception of my stressors, or effectively reframing how I viewed things has helped a lot. Sounds simple right? It isn’t, but it comes with practice. I implore anyone who hasn’t tried practicing mindfulness to just give it a quick search; look into what meditation can do for you. There is a lot of research that points to our health moving forward relying on how we combat and deal with stress, and even implying that if we can reframe the way we perceive stress in a more positive way  it can even save our lives down the road.

comments,"I can only speak from my own personal experience, but I didn’t have a internship prior to graduating and it didn’t hurt me getting a job. Very few of the places that are hiring junior developers expect them to have any real, serious coding skills but rather a general understanding of technology and how to learn/pick up coding languages. (If you’re going for Facebook/Google/Amazon etc. that may be another story)

 More and more I see companies putting emphasis on the culture side of an interview; can you go in and show them that you’re not an asshole/that you’re generally pleasant to be around. Making a good personal impression will carry you quite a ways. As you’ve probably heard at some point, most of the real skills that you use in your day-to-day job are learned on the job.",positive,0.6808,positive,0.21595238095238095,04/10/2019

This is like a degree mill for anyone who wants to pivot into a CS role with little to no academic experience and it's less than 8000 dollars. I know the on campus masters program provides a much rigorous course load and with a wide variety and depth for experienced CS students. To get accepted into the OMS, you can go to a no name community college or school with an associates or bachelors , take some 2-3 related CS classes, and then get accepted to the OMS.  You might think that you worked your ass off in undergrad as an engineer or CS major at tech, but the reality is.. an online masters student that went to georgia sstate or north gwinnett or trump university just got accepted to the OMS and will compete for the same position as you at x company if they learn the material faster.

With OMS, you watch udacity lectures and easily pass the classes with a B or higher.  Unless you're working for the big tech companies, your best bet is to get that industry experience, and quickly get into management roles because a lot of companies don't have much respect for developers. They're like pawns on the chessboard that essentially does the dirty work.  I learned this when a lot of Project Managers and BA's at my company looked down on me as I was just a developer.

The next internship (actually in SWE) was at a small local company. Since then I've had no trouble getting callbacks from applications.

One thing I liked about CmpE over CS is that we have the opportunity to explore different areas of the field.

Idunno, I'm a CS minor and it's taken me a good 5 tries over the last decade or so to really get the hang of it. I couldn't even handle high school courses or online courses like freecodecamp. It took a good professor, a good TA, and a damn good amount of persistence for me to get over the hill. Not tryina come off all motivational speaker-like, but I think anyone can get the hang of CS after any number of tries. Even if you take it 15 times, as long as you get it the 16th, you've got a way forward.

That summer, I realized I needed to reevaluate my major because there was no way I was getting through all of my other math classes - I switched to LMC and haven't looked back since. Yes, people give me shit for switching, but I did what was best for myself and I enjoy LMC much more than I enjoyed CS. There's definitely a lot more kids than you think that ""hate"" math on campus. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I will say, there are so many great resources on campus to help you pass your classes - PLUS sessions, office hours, tutoring, etc. etc. The only reason I passed Calc II was because my professor knew me from office hours and basically pity passed me. So, don't think it's not possible. However, if you're really worried about it, the math track for everyone that's not engineering/CS (finite math and survey of calculus) is much easier than Calc I, Calc II, discrete math, linear algebra, etc. So, that helps you if you're a business/LMC/public policy/whatever else major. Don't be discouraged! This school kicks everyone's ass, and you'll find a way to get through your math classes (also, keep in mind that a lot of kids end up taking their math classes at other universities during the summer where it's much easier and transferring the credit).

1. When you go to a school like Tech, no matter how much you were ""top of the class"" in your high school, you will find that you are much closer to average than you were before, and that feels wierd.  Remember, Tech only admits a very few highly qualified people, and you are one of them.  This happens to virtually everyone at some point in your life. Even if you are the top in your Tech freshman class, you'll feel this in grad school, or at your first job, or somewhere.  Heck, even Leonardo di Vinci had Michelangelo painting across the room from him at one point.
2.  ""Perfection is the enemy of the good"".   You are so scared that you are going to mess up, that you would rather procrastinate and not study, then acutually buckle down and study.   Just about everyone experiences it, and there is no magic button (hey, why do you think so many people post on reddit when they are trying to avoid doing something they don't want to do).

comments,"agree.  You can totally put up a regular traffic light that rests in green for vehicles.  Once the button is pressed, the vehicle light can operate like a signal, going to yellow, then red, then flashing red before going back to green. When the light is red+flashing red that's when the pedestrians get their signal. It can operate the same as a hawk signal but with none of the clunky confusion.

The issue with hawk signals is that we are trained to treat signals that are off/blank as broken and an all-way stop.  Hawk signals normally rest in off/no lights on mode.  Also, the wig-wag alternating flashing red lights can mean stop and never go since its the same sequence as a railroad crossing.",negative,-0.7579,neutral,0.013194444444444446,04/11/2019

1. No CIOS results get thrown out.
2. Pressure from administration to get more reports blah blah...bullshit.
3. If you don't fill out the CIOS, you're screwing your future classmates and yourself.

CIOS is directly related to promotion and tenure along with a $1,000 cash incentive for faculty who have high scores in Overall Effectiveness.

comments,"Their fee does not allow for overnight parking and is restricted to only two locations.  We allow you to pick any one of 30 locations on campus and you can park in any of those locations on nights and weekends.  If you want to park overnight at GSU it is $400 per semester.  The school could be subsidizing the parking with the transportation fee or out of the general fund.  We know that downtown parking rates are lower than midtown maybe that has a factor.  We believe they charge visitors a flat $10 and we charge $2.00 per hour. So, as a visitor at GSU if you stay 20 minutes it cost you $10 and at GT it costs $2.00.  Also, Georgia Tech has 14 parking decks we have to pay debt service on and at GSU we believe there are only a few decks which are very old and may already be paid off.

2.  If that's the case, then I was explicitly misled by at least two profs, one of whose research deals directly with selection and measuring organizational effectiveness, and the other of whom was an associate dean who dealt with faculty personnel matters.  I guess it's possible I misunderstood, but I'd think it unlikely.  Perhaps it varies by college/department?

3.  Agreed; I didn't think that was even in contention.  We were making jokes here, maybe the context is causing confusion.

I love this school. It's hard, a lot harder than Perimeter, but it feels more like I'm being pushed to do what I can, rather than just cruising through like I was at the other school. I maintained a 4.0 there and got my ass kicked my first semester here, which is pretty common from what I've read / been told. I'm doing better this semester, but it's still a struggle at times.

But I would rather fight and have to try hard here, even if that means failing sometimes, than cruise through somewhere else knowing I could have gone to a better school.

comments,"I transferred in last year after finishing all of the prerequisite math/science/etc courses at Perimeter.  I had already completed one bachelor degree @ Georgia State in 2011 as well (I'm old).  I'm finishing my 3rd semester here now.  Some thoughts:

1. This place will push you.  It is a completely different caliber, but its ***all*** about time management.  If you were accepted, admissions thinks you can do it, and they're right.  Don't be afraid of GT for its rigor, its worth it.
2. Social life is what you make of it.  Its on you to introduce yourself to people &amp; get involved.  GT gives you endless opportunities to join clubs, research teams, you name it.  As far as making friends as an incoming sophomore, all it takes is saying hello!  Just like anywhere else. In my first 2 semesters here, I made more friends than I've made in the last few years combined.  We all suffer together.... Lol.
3. Don't underestimate the amount of work.  The material is not any more difficult than any other program anywhere else, but the workload is huge.  I was a much-better-than-average student at other schools, so I came here with a bit of a chip on my shoulder - but GT quickly taught me that I am average at best.  But when you're at a school of very high achievers, average is fine.

I love it here.  Nuff sed

That said, you can absolutely have fulfilling social experiences here, it just requires a bit more work (easier said than done for many).

Compared to high school? **Waaay** harder if you're not incredibly outgoing. Part of that is because of how much larger Tech is, though.

In phase 2, you should probably be able to get a spot if things don’t work out in phase 1.

**Strong** disagree on GTPD.

1\. Lol if you think GTPD's alcohol enforcement strategy is too strict you should go check out another school and see how it is. Unless you're blatantly swinging around open containers in the street or in your dorm's lounge in front of your PLs/RAs, their focus is entirely on keeping you safe, not citing under 21s.

Even then, look at the [crime logs](http://police.gatech.edu/crimelogs). They decline prosecution on every MIP instance because they realize that law enforcement resources are better allocated elsewhere.

2\. I seem to remember them running a very aggressive public awareness campaign for weeks if not months of giving warnings instead of citations. They were very clear and gave ample notice that they were going to begin issuing citations for those traffic violations.

I'm very glad that they hand out citations for bikes on sidewalks and running stop signs. When you ride a bike, you're a vehicle and have to follow the laws regulating vehicles. GTPD isn't mall security, they're a full-fledged law enforcement agency. Have you never gotten a ticket before? They usually come with court dates, especially for younger drivers. Just show up, pay the fine, and move on. Part of being an adult is being held accountable for your actions under the law.",positive,0.514,positive,0.1915151515151515,04/13/2019

The officers have nearly hit me a number of times thanks to not using their blinker, seemingly just paying no attention to others when moving, and running red lights. I was nearly splattered on the road one time cause they seem to enjoy going 30 over the limit on the wrong side of a one lane road around a bend at night without sirens (but with lights on)? That one still scares the hell out of me. They act like they’re above the law, and they don’t bother enforcing laws regarding cyclists and bike lanes.

At the beginning of the semester sit down with each class’s syllabus and mark down each assignment due date, test, and final.

Also get involved! A huge misconception as a ME is that you’ll never have any free time for extracurriculars, so often MEs don’t even try to get involved. This time crunch is honestly not true; with just a little bit of planning and prioritizing there is always leftover time to do other things you enjoy. A huge key to success here at Tech is finding something outside of classes, whether it’s a sport, student org, or anything else, to help you de-stress and feel encouraged during the rough parts of the semester.

comments,"I’m a grad student (at Tech) now and I went to a different school for undergrad but here is my experience. 

I did research during my summers (actually year round). The research I did was relevant to the field I wanted to work in (thermal science/energy). I was also considering structural consulting (I did my senior project in this field).

Both my research experience and senior project got me interviews and offers at relevant industry  companies. I ended up deciding to go to grad school instead. 

Overall, I would say internships (especially at companies you would like to work for later) are better but any experience with tangible accomplishments should suffice. This is easier to do if you are highly interested in what your working on.

Tech offers a masters in analytics (both on-campus &amp; online), which is a great program in order to gain a graduate degree to get into data science. But, to answer your question, yes - ISYE would work for that career path, especially with your current viewpoint of not really loving programming &amp; liking statistics/economics.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as your concerns, please don't pay attention to this sub *too* much. Yes, the complaints are valid, but people really enjoy venting on here. Will you get stressed here? Yes. Is it a harder school, workload wise, than Michigan? Probably. Will you be stressed 24/7, always drowning in your classes, and always worried about if you're even going to pass? If you were admitted, you have more than enough ability to not have to be like that. It's all about time management. No offense to Michigan, as it's a great school, but GT is by far a better choice for both data science as a career &amp; with ISYE.

&amp;#x200B;

For dining, transportation, &amp; dorms? It's the same story. They aren't great, &amp; they should be better for a school of this size &amp; ranking, but they aren't going to completely wreck your life. The food really isn't that bad - there are three dining halls, &amp; yes, they get old after a while, but you also get money to spend at the on campus restaurants, like CFA or Panda Express. I quickly learned to not rely on buses &amp; walk everywhere - we're in the middle of one of the cities with the worst traffic in the country, you can't rely on buses to be on time 24/7, &amp; you can walk across campus in fifteen minutes if you hurry. I'm not sure what you've heard about the dorms - they're smaller, sure, but they're not *bad*. Just old. They're great for forming bonds &amp; friendships that will last, something you wouldn't really get in an apartment your first year. However, most people do move off campus after their freshman year, or live in one of the on campus apartments &amp; cook for themselves - not many people get a meal plan, they just buy dining dollars to eat at the on campus restaurants with.

&amp;#x200B;

comments,"GT has given me a lot. 

1. I absolutely hated school -- and never really tried before GT. I failed my first class at GT (Calc 2) and learned why I should try in life.  Tech surrounded me with people that cared.

2. The institution showed me incredible opportunities
 1. teaching others as a TA
 1. building community as an RA
 1. marine biology, which i've never seen before in my life
 1. working on a nano-satellite with some of the greatest minds in aerospace, 
 1. study abroad 

3. It has opened up countless doors
 1. I met my wife on the study abroad trip
 1. I have relationships that have lasted 10+ years, when friends before college only lasted 2-3 years
 1. I got my internship through GT
 1. I got my first job on the GT brand alone

1. It showed me a better way. There's always a place to strive for more, and that doesn't have to be online.

Sure, the raw procedures of what I do can be learned from a book. But I didn't really learn much trade directly, as that was learned under fire while focuses on the concepts and theory. Even then, the content of what I learned is hardly the focus, as I agree, it's something out of a book. I got to meet the people that write those books, and now I work with them on a daily basis.

I found taking a shot-gun approach to exams worked best for me.  I read each question carefully, all the way through, and underlined key criteria. Then I’d list the order I was going to work the problems in. Then I’d start working down that list. If I got stuck for too long on one problem, I’d start taking a crack at one of the others.

I was in your position not too long ago. I loved coding and the various possibilities of CS, but I've always felt inferior to my smart classmates. I hate data structures to this day and dread studying them for interviews. I'm just not good at it, but thankfully not all interviews require a full on data structure test. However depending on your threads, the upper level CS classes are NOWHERE near as bad as the intro weedout CS classes are. I've taken upper level People/Media/Info Network electives and they're much more fun and project oriented than hard tests. I've done 3 internships and pursuing a 4th one this summer, and I'm actually doing MSCS at GT as well. Once you get through the intro classes, the upper-level ones are so much better because you can work at your own pace.

comments,"Here is what I did to study for the exam, maybe it can help you:

1. Reviewed my homework code. To be honest, I feel like 50% of the exam was just re-writing code that we already wrote from homework, so really getting to know the code and replicating it -- with the base/edge cases -- is vital for success. I looked over the homework, but, more importantly, I rewrote important parts from all relevant homeworks so I really knew the edge cases and algorithms by heart.
2. Beyond knowing how to write the algorithms, I then spend time making sure I know exactly how they work, especially in regards to big-O (worst case/average case/resizing etc).
3. I then review the weekly course notes / Saikrishna slides.
4. I think about what types of problems they'll have us draw out (AVL trees, 2-4 trees, rotations, hashmaps, sorting, searching) and do many practice problems. Think about what HB may give us and know how to do those problems (e.g. heap/algorithm diagramming, rotations etc) to really master them.
5. I take practice tests / tests from previous years from canvas. I make up problems and google problems to help me understand.
6. I study with friends, explaining concepts to other people can really solidify your understanding and challenging each-other with interesting problems can really help you think about the content.
7. One should attend every lecture and recitation -- and actually pay attention and take notes -- and potentially tutoring / office hours may be helpful for you.

On top of studying, keeping up with lecture and content before studying can also really contribute to success. If these strategies don't help, switch it up because you may be doing something wrong. Really knowing the content, in my opinion, is the only way to overcome not having enough time. Starting a good amount of time before the test is also good.

Please don't let 1332 convince you that CS isn't for you. It's a challenging class and there's no doubt about that. I really don't think you'll see a lot of the exam material ever again in your life (including interviews). Interviews for internships mostly test how well you're able to look at a problem, understand it, and think through it (not usually something like 'remove a node from a 2-4 tree').

Also, HB looks at the median for some weird reason. tbh if she told us the *mean* for the exam i think we would see much different scores.

You mention you have good research experience, but anyone that does research in undergrad probably thinks that about themselves.

comments,"1. I'd recommend that you read through the /r/Fitness wiki, it has a lot of information for gym newcomers. Also check out r/gainit. You would probably benefit from a beginner program such as GZCLP, Greyskull, or 5/3/1. They may look like less volume, but you will get stronger faster and use your time more efficiently. You can add on some of your exercises you're doing as accessories. If you're going to take creatine, you should take it every day, 5 ~~mg~~ *grams* (whoops).

2. 4 days is a good amount of time to dedicate to your fitness. Typically full body routines will be 3 days a week or every other day. 4 days are usually upper/ lower splits, so you have 1 day where you focus on upper body and 1 where you focus on lower body, i.e. legs. 

3. 6 weeks isn't that long in the grand scheme of things. You need some longevity to get real muscle mass, but if you're at 120-125 your body fat percentage is probably low enough for your muscle to show once you get it.

comments,"Nothing is inherently wrong with this (everybody has workout opinions on things that should be, what worked for them, blah blah blah) but the main problem is that there’s no progression. Your exercises don’t list an increase in weight or reps (this may be implied, but I’m just making sure). Without increasing, you won’t see many gains because you’ll reach the ability to complete your workout after building a small amount of muscle and won’t build beyond that. Whenever an exercise becomes completable, add an extra 5lbs or rep to increase difficulty. You should always be reaching towards failure. 
On a different note, I highly recommend recording your workouts and what you were able to complete for the day, so that you know what weights/reps to work towards next time.",positive,0.5372,positive,0.07384615384615384,04/17/2019

comments,"OK, you know what you did wrong, and that's a good start.   You made a 50, and potentially could have had a 65 just by not selecting the right sort.   That's not ""i picked the wrong major"" territory.  One thing that my 30+ years of coding has taught me is that I NEVER have to turn in real code that hasn't been through a compiler or interpreter.  You don't necessarily suck at coding because you can't write an algorithm down when you are used to using an IDE to help you write code.  If you are able to do the assignments, that is a much better indicator of how good you will be at coding.   

That being said, you also need to get better at the test taking aspects.  Try doing more ""practice test"" type coding, where you act like you are working on a real test, to help you realize where you have been relying on google, the IDE, and the compiler to help you (all valid real-world strategies, but no good for test-taking), and where you really have it down cold.   ""Went through"" is not the same as actually practicing.

BTW:  I talked to another 1332 student who has been doing better on the course than it sounds like you have, and he also indicated that the test was just too much to get done in the time allotted.   That is tough, and that induces panic, but some of the other people's advice about not getting bogged down is good.",positive,0.9474,positive,0.10750547345374932,04/17/2019

For APPH 1040, I went to literally no classes and only showed up for the 3 exams and still got an A. But it depends on the Professor (avoid Snow, Teh/Rosbruck are the ones I had) and how that class is being taught that semester. I suggest going to the first week of classes to test out how much you’re getting out of the class, that you couldn’t learn yourself using the resources given online, and then attending the class how you see fit, and if you do good on the 1st exam then continue what you’re doing but if you didn’t, then going to class more might help.

comments,"My general consensus is that you're going too heavy with too few of reps on most of your exercises. This will probably lead to poor form, and less growth as a result. 

Also, abs are (mostly) built in the kitchen. If you want better abs, the best way to get them is to lower your body fat through a good diet. This will be incredibly tough if you're trying to gain over 1lb of body weight per week. That being said, imo, the best way to train abs is by doing nearly every ab exercise with a vacuum or partial vacuum.

Finally, please don't skip legs. They literally make up nearly half of your body, and if you're disproportional, nobody will care how big your biceps are.

comments,"I was guilty of some of these same misguided worries when I was in undergrad here. We tend to think that grades are some kind of divine markers of our intelligence that make or break us. But they're really just indicators of how you are progressing. Getting a bad grade is a good chance to step back and look at the larger picture and then course correct, but not a reason to give up. It's not a symptom of unintelligence or lack of ability but rather a symptom of a process that can be improved. 

Just by being accepted to Tech you have been recognized as someone intelligent enough to find success here. You can absolutely do CS if that is what you want to do.   
  
So now take this moment to really reflect on your own motivations. WHY do you want to do CS? What career goals and future life do you envision for yourself in studying computer science? Are you doing it just because you want the money and prestige that comes with it? And if that is the case, are you the type of person that can sustain motivation on those terms? When you find that motivator write it on a piece of paper and stick it on your wall. 

Now once you do this soul digging, and you get to a place where you can see the future you want and that future requires you to study computer science then let's get to the next question. WHY did you get a bad grade on the exam? Did you go to class? Office Hours? Do the homework?  

Think of your study habits as an iteratively designed process. You're always going to be making adjustments to how you work as you learn more about yourself and take on more challenges. Take this bad grade as a chance to learn something about your habits. Review your exam with a professor, TA, or fellow student. Find the areas where you didn't fully understand something and then think about how you approached learning that material at the time. Maybe you studied that while watching TV? Or in a noisy place? Or with a friend that didn't understand it well? Maybe you missed a class that covered that or didn't fully understand the homework? Maybe that material required you to use another skill that you might be missing, that you need to brush up on. You can do the opposite when you receive good grades as well. 

And you will have to do this kind of self-reflection all through school and your career really if you want to continue to grow. Try not to focus too much on means and other students, but focus on what YOU are learning and how your habits are improving.",positive,0.9675,positive,0.11637931034482761,04/17/2019

I'm assuming you're an IE major. 2551 is pre-req/co-req for 2027, which is the pre-req for pretty much every IE class you'd have to take (except 3025 I believe). The prereq for 3133 (optimization. it's the first ""real"" IE class imo) is 2603 and 2027. So you would want to get 2027 out of the way as soon as possible, meaning you should take 2551 as soon as possible. A lot of my IEs take 2027, 2603 and 2316 together in one semester, so they can take 2028, 3133 and 3232 the next semester. You can get a permit to take them both at the same time, but that's a lot of math.

Leaving symbols of people that actively oppressed minorities in elevated positions reinforces the idea that their oppressive ideals were and still are valid. For the same reason that people in Eastern Europe toppled statues of oppressive leaders, so too should we topple symbols of those who oppressed Americans. 

Obviously a degree of sense is necessary here, depending on the name on the building. If, for some reason, a building is named after a white supremacist, that should be changed. But for those named after politicians of segregated time periods (someone else mentioned Wilson), it's a little tougher as they had a larger role in events of the day, outside of racial contexts. 

I have no idea why you mentioned the 1st Amendment, because that only protects what you say from the government. It has nothing to do with the government renaming its own buildings due to public pressure. You can name your own building after whatever you want, but neither your nor anyone else's first amendment rights are violated if a state-run university decides to change building names in response to public pressure.",negative,-0.9336,positive,0.06276041666666667,04/17/2019

comments,"I'll try and address your points in order:

I don't think what is deemed historically significant should be subjective, and I believe historically significant buildings, artifacts, and art should be preserved. In reference to the statues, I interpret them as a moment captured in time, rather than a representation of the entire life of a person depicted. I don't have the perspective of the sculptor, so I'm in no position to decide whether it is celebrating the bravery of a hero or warning others of a tyrant. Either way, it has historical significance, and therefore value, to me. This is no different than the great Wall of China or the pyramids, imo.

In regards to specific people's names on buildings, I think you're choosing to focus too much into a singular event instead of their lives as a whole. If a doctor saves 1,000 lives but has 5 people die on his operating table, does that make him a bad person? If you look hard enough (and seemingly everyone does nowadays), I'm sure you can find low points in everyone's lives.

I mentioned the first amendment, as freedom of speech is defined as ""the right to express any opinions without censorship or restraint,"" and I feel that fully applies when someone chooses what name to give a building. OP never said anything about buildings in question being government-owned, so I generalized my comment to apply to all buildings, as not all colleges are public. That being said, my sentiments don't change, simply because a building is now owned by the government.

I fully understand that we will not agree on this, and I don't expect to change your mind, but I am worried that if we keep trying to forget history, it will be repeated.",negative,-0.6403,positive,0.11078042328042328,04/17/2019

You are capable of anything you put yourself to.

Heckerooski, one test barely determines 20% of a flippity-floppin class grade. Class grade! You get over 40 (ish?) of those class grades in your ~~4~~ ~~5~~ ~~6~~ 8 years at tech!

My advice to you, Brosiedon, is that you look at this shortcoming and ask yourself why you failed the test. Abroham Lincoln, did you miss a problem because your were blindesided (#right tackle) by a concept? Barack Brobama, did you do poorly because your didn't sleep well the night before.

comments,"A matrix A is regular if there exists some power of A that has only positive entries. For example, if A\^5 had all positive entries, then we could say A is regular. For a 2x2, you usually just brute force the first few powers A, A\^2, A\^3, and you'll be able to determine quickly whether A is regular or not. There are some much more elegant ways to do this though, PM me if you're interested! 

The stable distribution is just the 1-eigenvector of the matrix (there should be only one if the matrix is regular). The stable matrix is the limit of A\^n as n goes to infinity. An extremely surprising theorem (Perron–Frobenius Theorem) is : If v (say it's in R\^2) is your stable distribution vector, the stable matrix is the matrix \[v v\].  I highly suggest you Wolfram Alpha your matrix to the power of 10 and see this in action.

There are a lot of intuitive ideas behind Markov chains, stable distributions, regularity, and so on. Markov chains are super powerful and cool, so PM me if you want to learn more :)

comments,"1. A regular matrix is a matrix such that for some power of that matrix, all the entries are greater than 0. So the first one is definitely regular. For the other two, look at the powers of each and see if any of them result in a matrix with strictly positive values. Some might have patterns to their powers.
2. To find the stable distribution, set up the system Ax = x, where A is the matrix and x represents the column matrix of your variables. The solution is your stable distribution.

Realistically I think the problems can be a bit more specific depending on your major/life experiences. But in general I think if curricula was updated across the board to reflect a more interconnected society where a lot of high level scientific work is done on teams and teaching standards were...more standard, then a lot of people's grievances would be solved. The school could create an environment much more conducive to learning and accommodating of different learning styles in general and also geared towards producing an engineer that is constantly connected to the internet. I get the whole 'trial by fire' and making things difficult for the sake of maintaining a reputation and weeding people out, but I just don't think GT is creating an environment where it's *easy to learn*

Besides that I wish GT would simply create an environment free of worries outside of school.

It's good that you have an interest data science. Keep it broad, explore your options. You don't know what you want until you get a taste of what's out there. I apologize about going off topic, but I, too, was once like this. I thought I wanted to go into investment and have a Wall street life. I tried to hard in my first few semesters to go towards that interest and only that, even though I absolutely hated my classes. It wasn't until I realized I didn't need to do this to myself because I was 17 when I decided my future based on a fleeting, brief interest. 

With that being said, welcome to IE! Our Analytics concentration is a pilot, but the in general, your concentrations don't really matter. If you stay in IE long enough to take 2028 (statistics) and decide you do like it, then 4031 (linear regression). IEs only have to take 3 official CS classes, but we do use programming a IE classes. The focus is on the math so though don't worry too much about that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even if money is not a big concern, I'd highly recommend GT. We have the number one undergrad and grad IE program in the world. Our professors are highly accomplished, it's easy to get involved in research. Also, I really hate the cold so I'm very biased towards warmer climate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't talk for other people. If you know how to balance school and work, plan out your schedules to have a good amount of medium-hard classes, you should be fine. I've never had to pull an all-nighter or gotten stressed to an overwhelming amount. Just don't fall behind on your work and know when to reach out for help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dining, transportation and dorms could be better. I'd like to think of them as part of the GT experience. Food is okay, the repetition gets tiring. I'd advise you to learn to cook and get the weekday plan. Buses aren't reliable. Walking is better than taking buses anyway. I got lucky and got to live in Glenn. Get a nice mattress topper and your freshman year shouldn't be too bad.

comments,"I totally agree with your statement above but there’s quite a few things that need to be unpacked here...the idea was that some institutions position themselves as x in the marketplace  but doing y instead; like a non profit that makes a shit ton of money and advertises to you with “please save the puppies”. Similarly when you position yourself as a top educational institution you should actually do that and don’t cover for the the lack of education with other “amenities” which are non relevant to education. So if investments in education are lacking,  and not much education is actually taking place but instead we all just play the grades game(would like to point out the mit opencoursweare here as an education resource as an example) then what is it a social network? To me it looks like the Catholic Church before the reformation and we all buy indulgences in the form of degrees which of course “work” if enough of us believe that to be true, hence the alumni association. Also you wouldn’t say that of course Christianity is the true religion look at all the connections I made on Sundays when I go to church.    I call up any of my Christian friends and ask for favors after all we are all Christians. The sense of belonging can be built around manny things education, religion, sports, political party etc but that is different from actually educating.
Why my criticism? I find my criticism justifiable if while enrolled at this prestigious educational institution I must attend classes taught by people that have no training in teaching, they (*not all but also not a negligible number) do a horrible job at explaining even basic ideas, use no books nor have any useful printed materials and while they consistently received negative feedback for their teaching practices have done nothing to improve. Personally I see a problem with that and, if we all are beings in search of truths we should call it out even if goes agains our own interests.

comments,"Start slow, the first week is always challenging, but after that you will feel very enthusiastic about working out and will fell good about urself. I have trained one of my underweight friend before, so here r some tips--&gt;

Can you really do 20 pushups in one go? If you can't, don't exert urself, just do 5 and do 3 sets, the reps are not as important as the sets. You can slowly increase the reps to 10 then 15 when you feel confident.

Don't take 20lbs for bicep curls, start from 10lb 20lb sounds heavy (if u r working out for the first time, or after a long time)

Also, pay attention to your movement and posture while working out, you may sprain your muscles or target the wrong tissue. 
Workout with a friend, you both may correct each other and learn new things. 
Be punctual and regular. Being regular is more important than spending more time in the gym.

comments,"If you’re doing CS, this school will have the most “clout” out of the three, though that shouldn’t affect your decision at all. You should go where you think will be the best fit for you - everything else will fall into place. I believe the only double major you can have with CS is math, but you can easily minor in business/econ (there’s a prestigious &amp; competitive minor called the Denning Technology &amp; Management program that you can apply for - it gives you a minor in Computing &amp; Business I believe, &amp; you basically get jobs/internships handed to you). 

Social scene is fine, whether you rush or not. It’s a bit different than typical southern schools - we don’t have (many) stereotypical frat/srat kids, &amp; it’s not like people are partying every night, but rushing definitely helps you obtain that “college experience” more than not rushing would. 

Yes, many kids get involved in research as an undergrad. It’s incredibly common, but you obviously have to put in the effort to find those opportunities. GT’s alumni base is quite good, but I can’t say I’ve had any experience contacting an alumna about a job opportunity or something of that nature. I know people who have, &amp; they’ve been successful. We’re recruited heavily by everyone in Silicon Valley, including startups - many kids do go on to work at investment banks/hedge funds, but we aren’t one of their top target schools (meaning they don’t come to every one of our career fairs like tech companies do). However, again, the opportunities are there, &amp; a CS degree from GT carries a lot of weight, so it’s not like you’d be at a disadvantage. 

As far as your other concerns (dining, stress, etc.), I addressed them in a post from a day or two ago. In short - they aren’t as horrendous as this subreddit likes to make them seem, because people come to reddit to vent, not to actually be levelheaded. Are they good? No. Should they be better? Yes.

Not fucking have a feast every four hours. At least that's what I tell myself every time I get something nasty in my salad bowl lol. And, you can always eat from other places once you're off your meal plan. Additionally, if you're even remotely thinking about grad school, there are godly researchers here at tech. IMAO, probably the only reason we're ranked this high, and there's a research option as your junior design where you actually publish. Getting research is pretty easy too based on what I've seen. Also, it is possible to double major in math, but I don't recommend double majoring since it's a time drain, away from your CS side projects. Furthermore, there's a good chance that we'll keep rising in the ranks but that depends a lot on what new changes Isbell (the new dean) implements.

The number of students who even know what citadel or Jane street or any of the prop firms are is fairly low. The demographics may be changing slightly, but still both Vandy and WashU will have better alumni connections in finance than GT by far. The big banks do recruit from GT, but not heavily for front office work outside of Atlanta. Mostly software development and technology positions, which it sounds like you may be interested in anyway. Still, if you’re interested in interning or eventually working on Wall Street, you’ll have a harder time doing that here. PhD-wise I think like others have said, you really can’t go wrong with the research that’s happening here.

I got accepted into a engineering PHD program at GA tech ranked top 5 in the country for phd, and I had a 3.19 undergrad GPA from a tier 2 school and 50th percentile GRE scores in math and verbal. First of all, know that there are definitely some highly accomplished researchers or grad students in top programs that received sub 3.4 GPA undergrad. Here are some tips that can bolster your subpar GPA application a lot:  
  
1.I truly love my field and I did leave a solid trail of research experience, which allowed me to get some stellar recommendation letters. For grad school, your recommendations and research experience are worth a lot more than undergrad grades. Be involved in as many research opportunities as you can asap.  
2. I took a few grad level courses and worked very hard to get A’s in them. It makes all the lower grades in that topic meaningless.  
3. Write a good personal statement.  
4. If you can score a high GRE, that is above 80th percentile Quant, it will help you.

comments,"Good Morning, 

As some have already said the tornado warning that was issued was not in effect for Georgia Tech, despite the GTENS alert that you all received.  It impacted parts of North Fulton, Gwinnett and Forsyth counties.  Our system is set up to automatically send alerts based on the tornado warning polygon actually impacting campus.  For some reason, the system was triggered based on the warning affecting Fulton county. 

We'll be reviewing this today to determine where the error occurred and work to fix it.

Our expectation is that GTENS is delivered only when you need to take immediate action for an imminent threat.  For a tornado warning, that means only when it affects the campus.

We're sorry for the inconvenience and early morning disruption.

I'll post an update later.

Around mid July, you will get an email telling you your selection date and time, and on this day you’ll get to choose the actual dorm and room you want as well as your roommate. 

On the topic of which dorms are the best, it depends on which side of campus you want to live on. East campus is typically known as the more lively/social side of campus. West campus is often more quiet and relaxed. In terms of which dorms are the best, I’m a little uneducated on the West Campus dorms so maybe someone else can comment about that. However, typically on East the most preferred dorms are Glenn or Towers. But in my experience you really can’t go wrong with any on east. Hope this helps &amp; congrats on acceptance!

tl;dr:

- At a crosswalk, cars must stop for you, but you can't just run out without checking for approaching cars.
- You can cross anywhere as long as there aren't cars coming, and once you're in the road, even if a car does come (like say they pull out from a side road), they have to yield to you.

comments,"Hey, a lot of this stuff applies to me too so I figured I'd answer this.

&gt; One of my questions is if GT students are recruited by hedge funds such  as Citadel and Jane Street, investment banks, or by Silicon Valley  startups (not just FANG). Is the alumni network at Tech solid,  supportive, and useful? 

Citadel, Jane Street, Two Sigma, etc. don't come to campus, though as far as I know they don't go to WashU or Vandy either--I believe they recruit from only Harvard, MIT, and Princeton directly (though WashU, Vandy, and GT would all be considered target schools). HRT comes for career fairs and I think Akuna Capital might as well but the tier 1 quant firms don't need to try as hard to recruit. That said, FANG are huge at recruiting at Tech and it should be very doable to transition from FANG to a top quant firm (that's what I'm trying to do with my internship).

&gt; Is the alumni network at Tech solid, supportive, and useful? 

I would say that they are but I'm not very involved in the Student Alumni Association here. On the other hand, I have made lots of good connections through alumni in my fraternity and I imagine that'll be the case at any frat.

&gt; But just to make sure, is it easy for GT undergrads to get involved with undergrad research (publication level)? 

Assuming you have the basic skill set needed, I think so. Many of my friends have done research and I'm planning on doing it in the Fall. For me I emailed the professor I wanted to do research with and asked if I could meet him in person since he doesn't normally have undergraduate research assistants. He invited me for a quick interview and that was it. There's tons of professors here specifically looking for undergrads too, so even if you don't get to research with one of them you can interview with a bunch.

&gt; How is the social scene at GT? Id probably join a frat. 

It's great if you're involved in greek life, though it obviously won't compare to state schools like UGA, Bama, etc. I'm not sure what social life is like at WUSTL or Vandy but I assume it's probably pretty similar here. The social scene is definitely greek-dominated so joining a frat is the right choice here. While a lot of students here aren't big on partying, ~25% of the school is greek and there's usually a few parties every weekend.

&gt; Is it possible to double major or minor with Scheller Business or Econ? How about math? 

I believe that you can do all of those with a CS degree (though you can't double major with math + anything other than CS). However, double majors are exceedingly rare at GT because it's a fuck ton of work. Scheller offers the T&amp;M minor which is very prestigious and will help you build plenty of connections, but it's more management focused rather than finance focused. I'm personally planning on completing the finance certificate that Scheller offers instead. No idea about Econ.

&gt; The dining here seems pretty bad too...while the dining at my other  choices are consistently top-ranked...should this be a consideration? 

No. If you're planning to join a fraternity you will almost never eat stuff from GT dining. Almost all greek orgs do lunch and dinner monday thru thursday and lunch of friday, so you really only need other food for the weekends (I'd recommend going to midtown for your weekend meals, there's a bunch of really good food right near Tech's campus). Out of the two semesters I've been here I've used ~25 meal swipes total (and many of those only for the sake of wasting meal swipes).

&gt;  Is GT really a bad experience? Is the quality of life bad?  

No, people here whine a lot more than people do in real life. Also, most people on this subreddit are people who aren't involved in greek life and in general aren't as socially active, so you see a lot more complaining about things like housing, food, social life, etc. that won't affect you. In terms of my time here, I've had a ton of fun and am very confident that I'm happier here than at most other schools I could have gone to.

&gt; but is there more ""clout"" in attending GT CS or another choice of mine 

Again, I'm not really sure I can talk about the other two schools but GT's CS program is definitely one of the most well-respected in the country. It's certainly a top school for almost every CS recruiter.

Plus, you're fresh out of high school. Most freshmen change their minds, since the major you picked on your application is most-likely based off of a mild, vague interest in high school.

If you or your family is well-off and can afford for you to go here, then I would consider it as an option. But, *if you're going to have to take out massive amounts of student loans,* then I would choose to go with FSU. Student loans may seem like not a big deal now, but they stick with you for a long, long time, especially if you take out $120,000 or get put with a predatory student loan company.

comments,"Here is some super high level analysis.

There are 29,370 students at Tech last year.

Approximately 1% of the population in the western world is asexual. I think we can assume they dont masturbate and arent interested in sex. So, our total eligible sex candidates are approx  29,000.

Based on one study from U. Wash, 76.4% of students had sex last year. Thus, we can assume, 21750 students at Tech had sex last year. Thus, 7250 students definitely masturbated in the last year. This is our first data point.

Of the 21750 students who had sex last year, we need to get some data on frequency of sex.

Studies show, people in their twenties have sex approximately 80 times per year. That is once every 4 days. I was unable to find a distribution dataset which would be awesome but i also spent like 2 mins on this.

Now we need to figure out how often people get horny. Google search got weird really quick. I asked 4 of my friends how often they get horny. From these 5 data points, it looks like we get horny more than once a day. So once every 4 days is not enough sex for everyone. This is definitely biased as our sample size is small and all male and all sexually frustrated.

Thus, 29,000 students at GT regularly masturbate

This is also one of the worst analysis i have done in my life. We need more datasets for sexual activity folks.",positive,0.8031,neutral,-0.0008045977011494286,04/20/2019

The guaranteed research position is a bit of a benefit, but is probably not really all that relevant (if you try hard enough at GT to get a research position and have genuine interest, you'll probably get one.)

comments,"I'm an engineer, but I can comment on a few things here:

* CS/finance is not my field, but I know Tech Square has a few startups.  You might also want to look into the Create-X program or Technology @ Management (T&amp;M).
* Undergraduate research in general is accessible if you're interested.  I know several people who have gotten involved (for engineering) (though I personally did not.)  Professors for early CS classes are pretty nice and/or might have connections to others.  Or, if there's a specific project you're interested in, you could reach out to someone involved with that.
* If cost isn't prohibitive, I'd consider academics, campus culture, and student life first and foremost.  All 3 are solid top-tier schools.
* Social scene is pretty good.  If you're a friendly person, you'll find friendly people.  Greek Life certainly helps with that.  Either way, just put yourself out there and be nice to people.  We also have football.
* Dining is okay, but it's definitely better at WashU and Vanderbilt.  WashU has some of the best dining (and their housing is much better too), and Vanderbilt served salmon (which GT didn't get until my sophomore year.  It's good but it's no Vandy salmon) when I visited.  That said, many frats have meal plans, and there is a Publix that's relatively close.
* Things like not dealing with it and self-isolating exacerbate things.  Reddit also exaggerates a bit.
* All 3 have ""clout.""  I'm not sure how much of a difference that makes.

WashU was my second choice, and I did not get into Vanderbilt.  I chose GT because I knew I wanted to be somewhere focused on engineering rather than somewhere more well-rounded.  Plus, Tech is a few hours from home.  I grew up near an SEC school (Go Vols) and was used to being somewhere well-known with good athletics programs (Go Jackets).

I really liked WashU.  WashU student life seems to be really great.  It's easy to bike around campus (NO HILLS), and it seemed like students could easily explore St. Louis.  For me, though, Tech's bigger engineering program, cost, and proximity to home won out.

Vanderbilt is also really nice.  I get the impression their student life is similar to ours except with more business and pre-med students.  Congrats on getting in.

I think all 3 are great options (and pretty campuses).  Hopefully you've visited them and have your own impressions to go off of.  Good luck with your decision.",positive,0.9993,positive,0.2987609329446064,04/20/2019

If you're trying to land a well-paying job at a FAANG-level company after college, GT is objectively better in pretty much every way. Close connections to professors might be nice, but I don't imagine that Swarthmore is a CS target school for many major tech companies. 

You might get a better quality education with smaller class sizes and closer connection to professors, but that means nothing if you can't get companies to notice you at a non-target. Sure professors can open doors, but in general being best buds with a professor is going to have less of an impact for your career than having FAANG companies looking at your resume at career fairs. 

With regards to your third point, it's not like humanities doesn't exist at GT, and it's not like a person's major defines their personality. STEM majors might have a higher concentration of certain personality traits, but in general the personalities of people I've met have all been incredibly varied; you're definitely going to find creative humanities/liberal arts ""types"" of people here even if they're STEM majors.",positive,0.9829,positive,0.26239648033126295,04/21/2019

And that's no shot at Swarthmore, it's a fantastic school. Just not for CS. Usually we get questions like this where it's GT v Cornell, Michigan, Princeton, Carnegie Melon, other engineering powerhouses. 

But, to address your concerns: Having connections to liberal arts professors and students simply isn't all that important. You'll want to be surrounded by like-minded individuals while pursuing your degree. That being said; GT has a small liberal arts program, and if you want to wet your feet in those classes you absolutely have that opportunity.

Choosing to nitpick at the minutiae of the clubs /u/SterlingRalph happened to list is silly; you're ignoring the numerous counterexamples of athletic clubs that don't require any background in the sport: men's and women's rugby, ultimate, squash, running, etc.

Putting all that aside, the amount of special interest clubs for people not interested in sports is staggering. Painting our campus of thousands of undergrads with the ""4 straight years of all engineering"" brush is doing Georgia Tech a massive disservice.

Look at clubs like TechList, which is a really interesting concept and still listed, yet has been inactive for several years. 

Another third I looked at were so casual that they didn't achieve the purpose I was looking for. Then finally the last third were promising, but such a commitment that personally I wasn't willing to make with all of my classes. Could I have had better time management? Yes, of course. But my argument is that I'm not the minority at all. Largely, social people at Tech fill their time with greek orgs, but only the minority also have time to invest in outside, non-technical clubs. This will likely be different at a place like Swarthmore. Like I began with, I think this is changing as the demographics of Tech change.

FYI, if you're a ME like me, and you're debating which one to take first, I'd recommend Multi.

There were a couple semesters I was worried I wouldn’t make it, but through therapy and psychiatry visits, I’ve been able to find a good balance.

The key for me is to keep in touch with family and get a solid foundation of friends that you feel you can really trust and lean on. I was nervous about making friends in college bc part of my anxiety is social, but I joined a couple clubs freshman year and just tried to be open to new experiences even if my anxious gut was saying to stay home.

I also have never taken more than 14 credit hours in one semester. This is something that will vary greatly from person to person, but I need down time to watch tv, play video games, and decompress. I’ll have panic attacks trying to constantly bounce from a group meeting to work to a party, etc.

It is definitely possible to manage at Tech, but you also have to know yourself. Finding coping skills/medication if you don’t already have either/or could be a big help.

comments,"Sure, which is why I asked OP why they wanted to go to college. Their first two points seem to indicate they value learning course material in the best way possible, but you learn more/better with real-life application at an internship or job vs. lectures, homework, and tests.

This isn't because GT courses are bad or anything, it's a universal thing: any company values internship experience so much because companies know you learn way more when you're actually working. And I don't know about OP, but I think most people will find applying their skills more stimulating than listening to lectures and interacting with professors. 

In general, the top-tier companies and top-tier positions that GT students are targeted for are more challenging/interesting. Undergrad is 4-years of your life, but your career lasts until you retire. In an ideal world of course having a well-rounded education is important, but I'd argue that college is just too expensive (OP didn't say cost wasn't an issue, just that there isn't a significant difference in cost) to not put a higher emphasis on career prospects.",positive,0.7637,positive,0.2625,04/21/2019

comments,"Thanks a lot for the reply. You're certainly not wrong in saying that there something else making me leaning towards Swarthmore. Other than the points listed above (which are all very firm reasons for me), I also currently go to a boarding school that has a very similar liberal arts environment at Swarthmore. The strong parallel between the two might be why Swarthmore is hard to let go of.

I absolutely agree that were CS and my career goals to be my deciding factors when choosing my college, GTech would be the no-brainer.

But, quickly regarding a few points of yours:

&gt; Having connections to liberal arts professors and students simply isn't all that important.

The value I see in connections to professors are more-involved research opportunities as well as letters of recommendations for future purposes, either for grad school or for finding a job/internship. Regarding a slightly more diverse student body, I find great value in hearing about perspectives and interests I myself have never had the chance to think about before. I was (and am) surrounded by people who are like me and NOT like me in high school, and it had been incredibly valuable in opening up my perspectives to stuff I would usually turn a blind eye on. This really has nothing to do with the CS-career aspect of things, you're absolutely right, but this is most certainly something I would want as part of my college experience.

&gt; That being said; GT has a small liberal arts program, and if you want to wet your feet in those classes you absolutely have that opportunity. Furthermore, I'd strongly suggest looking at the course requirements for CS

Regarding this, I've actually been planning out my GTech courses starting from two months ago (a little after when I got accepted). I don't want to go as far as to say that the liberal arts reqs are a joke, but like what u/apersonwhosonreddit said, there does seem to be a sentiment that not too many people care about those courses (I've spoken to a few GTech students about this). Which is totally valid, don't get me wrong, it's just that I don't know if that's the kind of sentiment I want to be surrounded by. Assuming I pass the AP exams I'm taking this year by scores of 4, I would have met every single social science and humanities requirement for my major.

With that being said, though, I do plan on minoring in humanities-related minors (trying to choose between public policy/law, sustainable cities, and/or Japanese). I'm sure I'll be able to find people who are more involved in humanities there.

This is most definitely what I'm observing so far, and while part of me thinks I'll do perfectly fine in an environment like that, the other part of me thinks I might what to have a little more than that my four years in college.

&gt; Ultimately, you’ll likely have a better time at Swarthmore, and become a more well rounded person. But probably at GT the best years of your life will be after college, once you secure a solid job doing interesting work.

comments,"Thanks a lot for your input. Allow me to respond to a few of your points.

&gt; Why are a smaller student body and being connected to professors major factors for you? What's your goal/purpose, why are you going to college?

Allow me to copy my response to a previous comment.

The value I see in connections to professors are more-involved research opportunities as well as letters of recommendations for future purposes, either for grad school or for finding a job/internship. Regarding a slightly more diverse student body, I find great value in hearing about perspectives and interests I myself have never had the chance to think about before. I was (and am) surrounded by people who are like me and NOT like me in high school, and it had been incredibly valuable in opening up my perspectives to stuff I would usually turn a blind eye on. This really has nothing to do with the CS-career aspect of things, you're absolutely right, but this is most certainly something I would want as part of my college experience.

I find it easier to feel like I'm part of a community in a much smaller environment (population wise). While my main goal in college is to gain as much of an advantage in my major (CS) as possible when finding a job, I don't want that to be the only purpose. The other purpose would be to receive a high-quality education, and that shouldn't be limited just to my classes in my majors. Non-major classes, interactions with professors, and interactions with other students (like-minded and not like-minded) should all be part of it too.

&gt; You might get a better quality education with smaller class sizes and closer connection to professors, but that means nothing if you can't get companies to notice you at a non-target.

I think you're absolutely right, and that's exactly where my struggle is. I know the advantages of both schools, I just don't know which quality I'm more willing to sacrifice: a more well-rounded education or better job prospects.

&gt; With regards to your third point, it's not like humanities doesn't exist at GT, and it's not like a person's major defines their personality. STEM majors might have a higher concentration of certain personality traits, but in general the personalities of people I've met have all been incredibly varied

Once again, you're absolutely right, and it's definitely unfair for me to make certain generalizations, but I would be lying if I said I believe the student body at GTech I would meet is just as diverse as Swarthmore.

Thanks for the input once again. Your question about why I wanted to go to college is great, and I tried answering that in my previous reply (let me know if I should clarify anything). 

Adding on to that, the advantages I see in a liberal arts colleges isn't simply better ""lectures, homework, and tests."" A large part of why I value liberal arts college is the general population I would meet there. Most of the value I get out of it would be through interactions, mostly informal, with people who are not like me and people whom I can learn a lot from. These interactions most definitely don't only happen in classrooms, and, in fact, I'm a little more mindful of what I get outside of the classroom than inside, especially considering that GTech's classes are top-tier as well.",positive,0.9771,positive,0.28667328042328044,04/21/2019

There are many courses that are unique to either the physics major or the electrical engineering major. This tends to be the case when you compare our engineering programs to other majors at Tech. Engineering programs simply don't share many classes in common with other programs because the engineering courses tend to be so specialized.

If you're interested in doing a double major, two majors in the College of Sciences is pretty doable, especially if you come in with a good number of credits. Physics + Neuroscience, for example, has a lot of overlap and minimizes the amount of credits you'd have to take to get that second major.

comments,"I'm going to share a little perspective from the way I see this, which is from someone who has 6 years experience working in an operations department at a facility larger than Tech.

Maintenance needs to be able to park anywhere(safely) to do their job, if this guy has equipment in his truck which he needs to work on something, it's vastly more efficient for him to be able to park right next to where he works. If he has to spend time looking for an open spot, that's time delayed from finishing the work, if he has to park in a spot which would otherwise be occupied by a student, that might mean a student is forced to park much farther away. Not to mention the general problem with having to carry heavy equipment and tools to and from a truck that might be 200 feet away. 

Another thing to consider is numbers. Tech has several thousand commuting students and maybe a 10th of that in maintenance / operations. Can you imagine how much more chaotic things would be if everyone could park against curbs for ""just a few minutes""? Not to mention how many times those few minutes turn into half an hour unexpectedly.

The other thing to think of is that these guys should (in theory) know how to park in a way that isn't blocking anyone and isn't dangerous. I've seen dozens of student vehicles that can't even manage that in a parking spot, I would never want them to be able to just toss on their flashers and park wherever.

Just a little bit of a different view on things, I've been in his position and it really would slow down / needlessly complicate my work if I had to find an open parking spot everytime I had to do something.",negative,-0.3147,neutral,0.013366402116402117,04/22/2019

comments,"TLDR It was worth it, but you're looking at more debt and a better alternative than I was.


I was out of state too. I got out with $20k of loans, which worked out to $200/month for 10 years at 3-5% interest.  It's a manageable payment on an engineer's salary, and I actually expect to pay it off early this year.  My car loan is for a similar amount, and I figure my education is more useful than the car.   If I had $40k in loans I'd probably still be confortable with it. 


$100k in debt would be around $1000/month.  That's like a second rent payment, and while I could technically afford it, it would keep me from saving for other important things like retirement or a house.


I will say that, based on your previous posts, my parents contributed a similar amount to what yours are looking at, if not less.  When I was in school I think the estimated OOS cost here was more like $40k/yr all-in, and I also had internships that offset some of the expense. In any event, going OOS is still going to be a big cost increase.


The biggest difference between your situation and mine is the in-state alternative.  For you, going from PSU to GT is a jump of ~20 spots up the US News CS rankings.  From my State U to GT was a jump of like 100 in the engineering rankings.   If I had a better school in-state, I would have been much less likely to pick Tech.

comments,"Some things I'm doing to counteract all the sitting I still have to do to keep my job:

- Planks
- Side Planks
- Reverse Tabletop
- Glute Bridges (Your butt is dying from sitting!)
- Single-Leg RDL
- Single-Leg Bulgarian Split Squat
- Clam Shells

Posture tip: When you sit down grab under your butt and feel for those two bones in your butt. Those are your sitting bones. Sit on those. When your press them down you should feel your core engage. If you can't hold your core strong for long you won't be able to press those bones down for long either. 

For me, my core is complete garbage and this made my hips shift and do unnecessary work when I was sitting. Working on core strength should be a first step for anyone starting out. Without a good core and proper hip alignment you're going to have a bad time. Even if you just start running. Running won't do shit for your core unless you force it to. Running was the only thing I use to do and I had to stop because my foot turned purple on one side because my hips were imbalanced and I was putting most of my weight on one leg. Didn't even notice. Its scary how off center you can get without even noticing.

Even if you just pick one of those exercises I listed your on a good start. I made myself do one after something I did often that wasn't good for me. Like, playing a video game. Finished a match: did a plank. Ate some junk: did some clam shells.

For me it was never about weight. I just have zero muscle. Don't kid yourself thinking you're in good shape because you don't have fat. Fat is healthy to an extend. Lack of muscle will kill you and your posture.

I'm also vegan now and eating right. Diet is important too. I had to do a complete 180 in my life because of the destructive path I was on. Its not fun. Take some steps now so you don't have to change everything late.

Edit:

Also, YOGA. If you have time to take a class I can't recommend this enough. Especially for men. You don't know the clarity and strength you are missing until you do some yoga classes. Holy shit.",negative,-0.8919,neutral,0.04565826330532213,04/22/2019

I definitely agree that life hasn’t slowed down since graduation (like I assumed), it’s easy to find excuses and keep putting it off. We glamorize and romanticize unhealthy lifestyles at Tech, it’s so profoundly stupid for a community of people who are supposedly so smart. Good habits can’t be procrastinated, they require weeks, months, and even years of gradual effort and reinforcement. Get started with healthy lifestyles in school, it’s definitely easier than when you’re older and feel burdened by other things.",positive,0.9906,positive,0.08558201058201059,04/22/2019

comments,"CM. I personally chose this major because of my interest in web/app design and development. The threads from the comment above reference what CM was like 3-5 years ago so a lot of the info from that is a bit outdated. I came in as CS and switched to CM not because it ""CM is the dumbed-down version of CS"" like many CS majors like to claim but because CM is essentially CS with a greater focus on design. CS and CM take all the same foundational classes and the biggest difference lies in the threads you choose and what you want to do with your degree. While CS is more well-known to recruiters, don't buy the idea that you won't get any job/internship offers simply because the name of your degree is not as recognized. (Warning: humble brag) I just landed my first internship *ever* this summer at NASA Ames as a software development intern. The people I interviewed with were actually fascinated by CM even though they had never heard of it. When it comes to jobs and internships, it's really more about the skills you have and what you make of your degree. In my personal opinion, CM is a great major for app development, especially given we have an Interaction Design thread, which is not available in CS. A CM alumni came to campus earlier this semester to talk about his current experience as a full-time Android developer and one of my CM friends worked on app development/design for a brain trauma assessment app. My point is that you can do all kinds of things with CM that are at the same level (or possibly even higher) than CS. Am I biased? Sure. But I sure as hell know that CM is not a ""diet CS"" and both degrees allow you to do incredible things.",positive,0.9287,positive,0.16517857142857142,04/22/2019

comments,"Thank you for the thoughtful response and also for your presence on this community. You've always given worthwhile comments to every post I've seen you comment on.

On the 3 hour rule, I have several thoughts.

1a. This did occur to me before posting the original post. To me, and I hope my teachers, the goal of taking a class is to learn the material. For some people, this may take 3 hours per class hour of studying and practicing. For others, it may take an hour. My issue with the 3 hour rule is that it focuses on time spent learning and not content learned. Therefore, to design a class using that rule is to design a class with a primary goal of keeping us busy, rather than designing for learning. I fundamentally disagree that this is the best way to design a course.

1b. Many of my classes have common (overlapping) content. Even if it takes 3 hours per class hour to learn something the first time, it sure doesn't the second and third times.

1c. School culture - I'm here first to learn, but I'm also at GT and not a trade school to make friends, make good memories, participate in clubs and intramurals, go to athletic events and concerts, and contribute to this campus community. These all take time of course. With a 15 credit semester including 1 lab and using the 3/1 logic, you're looking at 65-70 hours of work per week (including lecture time). With this time demand, it should be clear that there is little to no time to do anything but school, which is something GT professes to encourage.

1d. If courses actually took 3+1 hours per credit hour, why on earth would GT allow students to take 18 hours, let alone 21 hours. Those loads correspond to 72 and 84 work hours per week respectively, or 10-12 hours per day if working on weekends (14.4-16.8 hours per day if not). As GT is taking some responsibility for its students' mental health, there's no way it should let students work for 80 hours per week.

On the cumulative curve, it may appear linear, but that is not so much the case under closer examination. The week before spring break has a large spike. For me, most of this homework was assigned the week before with no notice. I had already committed to basically not having a weekend the weekend before (car repairs, service event, haircut, other scheduled errands), so I only completed about half of that homework by the due dates. The other large spike occurs during the last week of school, which was 105 hours of homework due that week. The average slopes pre- and post-spring break are worth noting as well (22 hours/week versus 38 if memory serves). That is a substantial increase in workload. The jumps in the plot would be more manageable if they followed a flatter portion (indicating a project with multiple weeks given to work on it), but as you can see, that is not the case.

On the topic of whether linear is good on not, it depends on the assignments you are getting. If the time scale of most assignments are a week or less, then linear seems like a good option for its consistent workload. If doing more project-based homework, I would expected to see flat portions and jumps, which indicate time given to work as well as large assignments. Hell weeks are the result of shorter assignments all assigned and due at once, often with tests and a large project due that week to compound the stress (homework due at the start of a test is quite common in my experience).",positive,0.9953,positive,0.15222619047619046,04/23/2019

One of the biggest focuses of getting engineering into elementary schools is helping children understand what engineers do and what they learn (because it's really quite multidisciplinary). With that in mind, I would suggest that you include as an objective finding a project from as many different engineering majors as possible (e.g., mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, etc.). That will help kids (and parents) get some sense of the diversity of engineering.

You could also have them find...

* a project that uses electricity and one that doesn't.

* (have them) explain their project to a student and then have the student explain the project to another student

* A project that is supposed to mimic an animal

* a project that uses an arduino or a microcontroller

* project that they can touch and try out - and do it!

This led to a lot of issues, which from what I can tell now, have been resolved. My unit is actually right below the upper pool and no issues yet other than someone breaking glass in it and them having to drain and refill the other week. Same setup I had at Azure, and it was actually overfilled once and did flood a few floors below including mine.

comments,"Having a romantic (which in HR speak means sexual) relationship with a sales rep of a vendor you're spending millions of dollars with is absolutely, 100% a fireable offense even for a VP or the President of the Institute

If this was about the leak, he would've resigned quietly about 3 months from now. This is 100% about this ethics breach and he had to have been first confronted about this like, yesterday, because there is a big yearly IT meeting TODAY that he was going to be one of the central speakers at. If he was going to step down over the leak this quickly, it wouldn't have been the day before a very public event he was supposed to be at

And in terms of the leak, I've been away from Tech for some time now (I used to be IT staff in a school) so I don't know where the recent leak happened. But,it's important to note that most of the IT staff on campus don't report to the VP for IT. Every school has their own IT staff who don't report to OIT. OIT just sets policies and operates central shared services like the network and email, but if the recent leak was like the College of Computing leak last year, OIT/VP of IT is not directly responsible for the operations of those staff. They report up through School chairs and College deans. That said, it's likely a breach of a million records came from the central HR/student databases which is under OIT, but governance of IT and placing blame for a breach is really complicated at a university",negative,-0.8546,positive,0.09656084656084656,04/24/2019

One thing to note is that these companies recruit differently than traditional hedge funds or IBs, so a program could have great placement at say Goldman and suck at placement for Citadel (or vice versa).

For tech roles these firms are extremely selective, much more so than traditional IBs.

comments,"The ""Cuban"" sandwiches are completely overrated.

I'll preface this by saying I understand that the farmer's market food has to be made beforehand, and therefore isn't as fresh as what you can get at a restaurant. I also understand that the people who run the Cuban stand are really nice people. However:

I discovered the wonders of Cuban sandwiches last year when I went to Papi’s for the first time. I loved it so much I go there every month or so just for their Cuban sandwich.

I tried to find a fix for my cravings at a place closer to campus, and was really excited when I found out there were Cuban sandwiches at the farmer’s market. Upon buying it and taking my first bite, I was immediately disappointed. First off, the entire sandwich was really thin and small, thinner as a whole than just the bread that Papi's uses in their sandwich. The bread was toasted way too much - all crunch and no chew. Most egregiously there was barely any pork at all, it was essentially just a pressed ham and cheese sandwich with way too much bread and (in my opinion), an overpowering amount of mustard.

Yes I'm comparing the food at an off-campus sit-down restaurant to an on-campus farmer's market tent, but just look at [this](https://i.imgur.com/zzOOE64.jpg) and compare it to that thing they call a Cuban sandwich (I was so disgusted I didn't even bother taking a picture of it). Papi's is a couple dollars more expensive (around $7.29 or so, plus tip if you don't order it to go) and off-campus, but it's huge and way more filling. If I'm not super hungry, I can eat one half and save the other for lunch the next day.",positive,0.1525,positive,0.07643678160919541,04/24/2019

No pest issues whatsoever in 1.5 years, either in my old apartment (lower floors) or in my new one (24th floor).

It's the safest building in the area; you need to use a key fob 3 times to make it from the building entrance to your room, which can in fact be a little annoying if you're tired, but makes it near impossible for someone without a key fob to follow you all the way to your place. An incident like the one that happened in SQ5 could never happen here. And the 24/7 concierge always acknowledges you when you enter the building (and they're good with faces/names) so any shady intruder would most likely be deterred by the concierge alone.

Those leakage issues ring no bells whatsoever; I live on an upper floor and know a few others who do.

There aren't any career paths that come to mind that would require complete knowledge of both majors for you to succeed in. It won't make you look better for software engineering or mechanical engineering roles. It won't make you more competitive in any way, especially if it's going to take you 5+ years to do it. 

If this is just about you enjoying both subjects and wanting to learn more, do it on your own time without your finances and career trajectory on the line. 

If you want to pursue something interdisciplinary, you'll most likely do most of your learning on the job anyway and a minor in either major would be just fine.

comments,"I am a Canadian from southern ontario and I work at GT, so maybe I can help you out...

Both UofT and GT are strong schools, so I wouldn't put too much emphasis on brand value: there will be employers looking to hire graduates from both schools. Georgia Tech probably has the edge over UofT for engineering, but not substantially so.

At GT you will have a lot of opportunities for research experiences if you want them. There are a lot of possibilities, and it's just a matter of talking to the right people to find your way to the opportunities that fit you. There are certainly a number of restricted projects that you won't be able to work on (DoD funding, etc), but there are plenty of other options for you as well. The other strength of GT engg and ECE itself is that they are *big*, so as your priorities or interests change and develop, you have many opportunities to shift around. On the other hand, you can get lost in the bigness of it all.

In terms of internships and coops, there will certainly be additional restrictions for you as a non-citizen. Visa issues complicate things, but they're not insurmountable. And if you think you might want to work in the US when you graduate, you might as well start figuring the system out now.

Other things to consider are things like the weather, culture, and politics. With the recent actions and plans of Doug Ford, universities in Ontario may be in for a tough few years...but it's hard to predict. Georgia and Georgia Tech are also a bit unpredictable, but as a strong school embedded in a strong state system, you don't have to worry too much about major funding cuts. Although as an international student your tuition will be higher and you won't have access to much (or anything?) in the way of financial aid.

Ultimately, my advice is that you pick whichever one seems to most suit your personality and interests...as a successful stint at either place will set you up for lots of great opportunities when you graduate.",positive,0.9972,positive,0.15579237071172553,04/24/2019

Don't leave dishes in the sink for days on end; if you do leave some for any period of time, make sure they don't have food on them. Don't leave laundry in the machines if you live off campus or at least don't get mad when your stuff gets moved. Don't take their food without asking and don't leave expired or rotten food in the fridge/pantry. Don't have people over without giving them a heads up unless they say they're cool with it, especially out of town guests/SOs/etc. Refill the britta filter if you empty it. Be aware of the time and what others might be doing if you're being loud. Don't get pets without asking (you'd be surprised). 

Pro tips if you want to be a good person:

Ask when their exams/big deadlines are and put a note in your calendar so you can make sure they're able to study in the dorm/apartment if that's their thing. Ask if they need you to pick anything up for them when you go to the store. Vacuum/wipe down surfaces every once in a while.",positive,0.8416,positive,0.08372053872053871,04/25/2019
comments,"First, CONGRATULATIONS, admission to Tech and the ZELL scholarship are very, very impressive!    


Next, there is a lot of discussion about huge amounts of student loans that people are unable to pay back.  Students were borrowing 60k per year to attend a private university and earning a degree that lead to a 30k per year job, putting them in huge debt.   

However, SOME debt coming out of college is considered acceptable, manageable, and even smart if it allows you to concentrate on studies and eases the burden of too many part-time hours.  One guideline is to try to keep your debt to 1 year's salary or less.   You would have to estimate a starting salary for your planned major  -- or ask here on reddit.   Assume a midrange salary rather than top or bottom.  Another recommendation is to stick with federal loans.

Most of my reading has been on paper (yes actual magazines or newsprint) but here is a link to similar information.

""In conclusion, no substantial association was observed between consumption of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee and tea and risk of breast cancer for the overall cohort. Higher consumption of caffeine-containing beverages may modestly reduce risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, and this relation needs to be examined further.

Analyses using the most recent caffeine intake before diagnosis of breast cancer showed no association (multivariate RRs for increasing quintiles of caffeine consumption were 0.99, 0.99, 1.00, and 0.96 (95% CI = 0.87–1.05).

In this large cohort of women, we observed no substantial association between caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee and tea consumption and risk of breast cancer during 22 years of follow-up. We found no evidence of an effect of either recent or long-term average consumption. We observed a weak overall inverse association with caffeine intake, and this association was stronger in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women.""

comments,"Hey! super long post incoming, tldr at bottom.

First consideration: is money in issue? I think my first choice would have to be any school that provides a full-ride and is comparable to the other schools in terms of ranking.

If money is not an issue, then let me talk to you about Georgia Tech and Aerospace engineering in general. For reference I am a 4th year AE at GT (I spent 3 semesters at UGA as an Applied Math and Mechanical Engineering double major), going into my final year this fall. I do research in Space Systems Design lab too. I can't speak to MIT or Stanford, but hopefully I provide some insight about GT.

GT is awesome at aerospace in general. A lot of what our program emphasizes is fixed wing. In the undergraduate curriculum almost everything is fixed wing based, there are options where you can take a handful of space classes (rotorcraft curriculum is essentially non-existent as an undergrad). GT boasts the Aerospace Systems design lab (ASDL) which does a bunch of model based systems engineering and configurable aircraft research. I am not too sure about the specific scope of a lot of projects, but I'm sure one of my buddies that is in ASDL would be happy to chat with you if you DM me. 

About the opportunities here. Georgia Tech's unofficial motto is 'You can do that here', however in my honest experience its more challenging than it seems to break through the barrier presented by busy professors and competitive students. I went from a school with basically no engineering department that was uber enthusiastic about research and letting students pursue anything they wanted to, to GT which is more of a hardcore research school itself with a well-defined engineering program. I noticed at UGA there was much less speculation and criticism for what you wanted to achieve, while at Georgia Tech I found that I was often written off and discouraged by staff to pursue my dreams (of creating my own satellite mission). The professors at GT are legends in their respective fields and won't always have the resources or bandwith to help you, even if they're on you're side. I think this could be more of a problem with higher tier schools in general though, so don't write off GT completely. With all of that being said, I have had a phenomenal time doing research as an undergrad. I have worked on 5 satellite missions, from the design phases to assembly, integration, and test, I have had the opportunity to work on independent space systems research with some funding, and I have found no issue finding other people who are just as psyched about space as me. Georgia Tech has no shortage of research labs or student initiatives to join that would help you become a pro at whatever it is that you want to do, especially in the aerospace and computer science departments. I think you would have no problem at all getting involved in research or cool projects from the get-go as long as you are energetic and willing to commit time. The biggest pitfall of Georgia Tech and competitive schools in general is that kids will join research or some project for a single resume line and then completely disappear. The competitive atmosphere can lead to a strange environment where the difference between the truly enthusiastic and those who just search for another resume line. With that being said, time will always manage to weed out those who don't truly care.  I know this was a ton to read, so I hope some if it can be helpful. I can't really speak to the specific research being done in ASDL, Stanford or MIT. But if you reach out to me I can try to put you in contact with some people at MIT and ASDL.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: GT is a great place, and would be free. They do some awesome aerospace systems research, and there is absolutely no shortage of awesome research or opportunities to take apart in, but be wary that some of the kids who are there for the resume line tend to make the onboarding process more tedious since you have to prove your alliance a bit more.

As I understand it, from looking at the concepts for PG, the last phase of the renovation contains no plans to include individual desks/cubicles in either wing of the library. I’m not saying they need to be hard-built into the floor, but it would be nice to have a defined cubicle floor that won’t be uprooted at the whims of events every other weekend.

comments,"&gt; You're trying discredit anyone talking about something that literally exists?

Care to support that statement? ...because people have literally been fretting about grade inflation since 1894 (literally...1894...note the correct use of literally). 

Also, what is the 'something' you are referring to? People love to say grade inflation but it gets a lot more complicated when we actually dig into the surface and deeper level meaning and how the two are played against each other. Let's take the implied meaning of 'grade inflation' - increases in grades without earning it. The implied meaning is important because most of the empirical arguments rely on seemingly intentional linguistic slippage that lowers the bar of evidence to 'grades went up...tres horrible!'.

So, with the underlying meaning that is really what folks are getting at when they clutch pearls and moan 'graaaaaaaaaaaade inflation' while dramatically fainting, the empirical evidence needs to be specific and clear to the argument being implied, don't let people lie to you with bad arguments based on over interpreting data. The data needs to show something like - we give the same test every year to college freshman. The actual scores on the test are the same every year, but the final assigned grades get higher each year. The scores themselves getting higher isn't by itself evidence of what is meant when people say grade inflation.

If we want to get into assessment and learning theory and education I'm happy to have more a lengthier discussion I'm all game. (and a more serious one...I'm being snarky because it's exam week and Reddit isn't worth being serious on to me, it's not personal) But be aware this is literally what I do. The modern framework for making claims about the interpretations of educational assessment is grounded in work by Kane and work by Messick. If you want to seriously engage in understanding grade inflation - and don't see those scholars cited, you should be very suspicious of the work you are reading. More generally, look for the evidence they provide and the meaning they make of it. As I noted, simply an increase in grades isn't evidence of grade inflation. To make a really stupid analogy, I'll bet GT students today get higher grades in CAD classes than students in the 60's. They might get lower grades if they were tested only on mechanical drawing. The course might even have the same name and number. That doesn't mean the grades are comparable.

Edit: I should follow my own advice and includes at least one citation... https://poorvucenter.yale.edu/sites/default/files/basic-page-supplementary-materials-files/2002-kohn-dangerous_myth_of_grade_inflation.pdf (note the original source for this is the Chronicle on Higher ed which is a trade publication for academia, it is not formally peer reviewed but authors are held to high standards of factual accuracy and logical argumentation.",positive,0.3345,positive,0.06869791666666668,04/25/2019

As I pointed out somewhere else, at MIT, you do not even get a grade on your transcript for your entire first year. It is pass/fail. If you fail it is not on your transcript. I can't imagine anyone would have the balls to say that MIT is not a prestigious school because of that. Not everyone uses freshman forgiveness, in the same way that not everyone will use this. It is the same opportunity being offered to everyone, which is, in my opinion, the epitome of fairness.",negative,-0.4576,neutral,-0.03500000000000001,04/26/2019

There could be several reasons beyond homework/assignments that a TA can't answer a Piazza post fast enough to satisfy you (some of which were even mentioned in the image you posted!).

Course syllabi, lecture notes, and/or what the professor says in class typically mention what you should expect on the final. As much as we'd like to know what questions are on the exam, we're not entitled to that information.

In the case of 2200, I've seen many 2200 TAs go out of their way to continue answering student questions after recitation, stay late on project days, and generally show passion for the course. In reference to this specific post, the professor already gave us ~10 previous exams we could look at for content and told us in class that it Linux scheduling could be on the exam.

As you get better and better from a fitness standpoint, you'll spend more time on the water improving the technical aspects of your stroke, and by the time spring season rolls around it'll be almost entirely practices on the water!

If you look at it from a fitness standpoint, rowing is one of the most efficient forms of cardio workouts there is and our high volume/low intensity training plan is pretty much guaranteed to get you in the best shape of your life. We're the top club rowing program in the south and are around the top five programs in the nation; we consistently take medals home from every race we enter, but the foundation of the program is built from the bottom up—80% of the team had never rowed before coming to Tech.

As the social chair, I can also speak to our camaraderie off the water as you'll meet a ton of your friends on the team. We throw parties on a regular basis, have a semiformal, and go to events as a team (e.g. Atlanta Braves games, Monster Jam, even the midnight premiere of Avengers: Endgame yesterday) and really try to make a group environment people want to stay in all 4 years at Tech.

Enjoy the intellectual challenge, and if everything somehow goes wrong and the worst happens (failing), you did your best! The worst isn't so bad here at Tech--maybe spending an extra semester--so what? You'll come out knowing even more than you would have! It's all about perspective.

comments,"OP here: 1, I just want to work and I do not want to immigrate. The reason is pretty simple: I am from eastern Asia, and my hometown is not bad at all compared to the cities in the U.S., especially compared to Atlanta. The reason for me to work here is because I want some experience on my resume so that when I go back, I can have the bargaining power to get a decent salary. 

2, I have no intention to get married. The racism in the U.S. is pushing us out of the dating market. 

3, I sort of agree that a merit-based immigration system is needed by the U.S., otherwise, Canada will consistently pull the talents from US to them, this will be especially true if dear President Trump is going to stay in the White House for another 4 years.

4, Also, I want to say something about the current situation. The reason why today the immigration system is so fucked up is that the democratic abused the immigration system at the beginning and then the nationalism and GOP fought back by making every kind of immigration/working permit more difficult to obtain. Basically, this is saying the system is so fucked up and needs reform. However, most of the voters are undereducated and they are so easily manipulated by the politicians and they think as long as they kick out the foreigners, the U.S. will be more fluent and they can get higher pay.

Both the honors program and EXPLORE program have very similar benefits. However, at the end, it really depends on what you are looking for in an LLC. Honors definitely has benefits in being exposed to plenty of different majors and having a lot of reserved sections for freshmen. I am not sure what kind of events they do though. 

EXPLORE has weekly events to network with professors whether you want to do research, premed, or if you want to go straight into a career or grad school. They have their own peer counselors and special sections for some freshman classes. 

Both definitely have a great sense of community. 

For second year, if you are picky about dorms, honors gets crecine apartments and EXPLORE gets placed in Nelson Shell.

comments,"Hey! I’m in the Global Leadership LLC, so I could be biased, but LLCs are overall a pretty good way to meet with people that you share certain interests with. The fact that you live and see the people you live with in a class you all together means there’s more interaction, not to mention the retreats and other activities that you do as a group. That said, you get what you put into it: the more you go out to the communal (nice) lounges or go on outings, the more friends you make. 

Other than that, faculty are more readily available to you I guess.  GL has a lot of chances for meetings with people in exchange/study programs because we’re more global focused, and I would imagine the same for Honors. 

If you’re stuck choosing between the two LLCs, then I would say it matters on your interests. If you want to be more global focused, then GL might be better, while if you want smaller class sizes, Honors might be better.

At-will involves the right of workers not under contract to leave whenever they like (and the reverse being true, with a company able to fire whoever they like whenever they like as long as it's not for a discriminatory reason).

comments,"It is not true that Sodexo can just stop serving whenever. From what I have been told, we do not have any record of 25 employees quitting. Additionally, it is my understanding that all employees currently working under Sodexo must be given the chance to continue on working through Aramark, though I will ask to get this confirmed. The current workers have been informed of this option and there are Aramark welcome flyers hanging for them to see as well.

Sodexo was required to report their closing to the State Unemployment through a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification. Through this, the workers currently with Sodexo will be able to continue their employment with Sodexo through their other accounts or stay at Georgia Tech with Aramark.

If you hear otherwise, please feel free to let us know and I can reach out to the VP of Campus Services to get any questions or concerns answered!",positive,0.6868,positive,0.21111111111111114,04/26/2019

comments,"One thing about Living Learning Communities (LLCs) like Honors and Grand Challenges is that they have dedicated dorms (aka you won't be able to choose what building or what side of campus you want to live in, but Honors is on west and GC is on east). I am not very familiar with Grand Challenges, but Honors focuses more on interdisciplinary courses and therefore you will have the opportunity to take classes that are otherwise unrelated to your major. I don't think that these programs have dedicated opportunities like the ones that you have mentioned. West is quieter and has a more ""residential"" feel to it, but east is more active as that's where the Greek houses are. Dorms for Honors (Armstrong and Hefner) and Grand Challenges (Cloudman) are pretty comparable. But if you choose not to join the LLCs, I believe that the general consensus is that Glenn and Towers are the nicest residence halls because they have been recently refurbished. Personally, I don't think that you should join any particular program because of its ""prestige"" because it would probably make your life more miserable if you don't actually enjoy the environment it provides. I know that it sounds cliché, but your experience is really what you make of it and the people that you meet, and all LLCs provide you with that opportunity.

I'd recommend retaking every midterm using blank copies (they provided those when I took the class), and, if you're up to it, also take/retake every practice exam they provided (or at least the ones whose content you struggled the most with). Then, go over your work with the solutions carefully and note what you're still having the most trouble with to study more.

It is difficult to make the transition that’s why after you’ve been using social media for a while quickly switching to the focus  state is difficult.
1. I would delete all social media apps Facebook , Insta etc until after finals
2. Take a quick brake a sudden transition into the focused mode is difficult...go for a walk  or meditate do a low stimuli activity to calm down your brain a bit
3. Try an easy and short focus activity like focus your attention on the tip of a pencil for 2 minutes and/or watch the seconds counter of a analog watch for 2 minutes, just follow it with your eyes as it goes around the clock.  When your attention drifts bring it back and pay attention to the seconds hand. This will help you reintroduce the focus mode.

comments,"In 2011 I was admitted to Hopkins BME and Tech BME. I chose Tech. I was in state, so that was a considerable factor. However, I still wouldn't have picked Hopkins. I toured and I have a friend who went there. 

They blind your grades your first semester - they don't get put into your GPA. However, they load you up with every chemistry and crazy entry level class they can, something like 18/21 hours because of the fact those grades aren't in your GPA. It makes for a miserable entrance into college. Also everyone and their brother is premed, even spanish majors, Literally everyone. It's incredibly competitive. Tech I feel like has a solid camaraderie in that we're all suffering together and people want to help each other. 

Yes you can manage your workload and sleep. Treat school like a 9-5 job with some overtime. You'll be fine. limit to 12 hours first semester, 15 hours second, max. 

I don't think any one course gives you an edge, but the weight of the name of the institute and the curricula as a whole. Tech also has the largest voluntary coop program in the nation and up to half of students also study abroad (you get in state tuition if you go abroad also - which is a perk for many out of state students). meanwhile Hopkins told me I shouldn't pursue internships or study abroad because it would delay my graduation. They have you on a very finely tuned four year plan - but you miss out on relevant real world experience that gets you a job when you graduate. 

Many students do undergraduate research and you don't have to stay in the college of your major. I did work in cheme and mse as a BME. 

Lol, it's not great but food shouldn't be a deciding factor between the two. 

Tech is hard. There are a lot of things wrong with it. But, I wouldn't trade my experience there. Remember that this is you and your journey, you follow your own path. You make it what you want. I had a social life, maintained a 3.28 GPA, did internships, studied abroad. I am certain I wouldn't have been able to do that at Hopkins.",negative,-0.36,positive,0.10303996598639457,04/28/2019

comments,"Atlanta is a pretty liberal hub buried in the South and the fact that it's a college environment means that you're more likely to cross paths with liberal students; however, I'd say that it's a pretty balanced mix. Then again, Tech isn't the type of school where you'll constantly be dealing with politics so I wouldn't worry too much. Be yourself and you'll find your niche. 

There are counseling as well as psychiatry resources on-campus. I haven't had any experience with psychiatry so I can't speak for that. When it comes to counseling, our services have a reputation for being understaffed and insufficient. Personally, I've only had good experiences but, I will admit that I was probably lucky because I went to the counseling center at the beginning of the semester when they're typically less busy or overbooked. If you currently attend counseling and intend to continue here at Tech, I would recommend going to the counseling center early in the semester to increase your chances of being assigned to a counselor. Otherwise, I would consider looking at offices outside of Tech.

comments,"&gt;Is it more liberal, conservative, or a balanced mix?

Like the other comment says, Atlanta is pretty liberal. Colleges trend liberal (as do most educated populations), Tech is no exception. However, most people are too busy to be super political in everyday life. That said, you will definitely be able to find likeminded people if you wish to be politically involved, and not just for those on the left.

&gt;Are the dorms comfortable? Which one is the best in regards to community atmosphere?

Some are nice, some are okay, some are not so nice. If comfort is your concern, try to get Glenn or Towers if you (or a roommate) paid the deposit early enough. Community atmosphere largely comes down to who you happen to get in your hall. However, some of the not-very-nice dorms do tend to foster tighter senses of community (e.g. Smith).

&gt;What are the quality of the professors? Any classes or professors I should avoid taking at all costs?

In my experience, most are pretty good, but there are some bad ones. For your lower-level courses, check RMP and/or ask around. For all courses, check the grade distributions for each professor for each course at https://lite.gatech.edu. Can't really say which specific profs to avoid since I'm CS, not AE. Don't take Snow for APPH 1040.

&gt;Is it easy to switch majors?

Yes, depending on some circumstances such as department GPA and what courses you've taken (CS recommends/requires that you first take certain CS courses, for example). It's easier to switch earlier than later, but don't stick with a major you hate just because you feel that you're too far along.

&gt;Is there a solid sense of community?

If you seek it out, yes. If you don't put forth a deliberate social effort, though, people will largely just ignore you, more than at other places. If you get involved socially and/or in clubs/orgs, you can absolutely have a fulfilling social experience at Tech.

comments,"I was in the AFROTC program at tech for 2 years (life happened and now I'm not anymore) and my experience was pretty good. Yeah there are a few older or younger cadets you wont necessarily agree with or get along best with but the great thing is, we were all working towards one goal- to commission in the USAF as an officer and try to become the best version of ourselves. In my 2 years in the program, the sense of community was the strongest I ever felt. I made some life long friends at DET 165. You go through everything together, good times and terrible times, and the bonds you form with one another are pretty strong. 

It's easy-ish to earn a scholarship (in my opinion) if you have at minimum a 2.5 GPA, a pretty good PFA score (1 min pushups, 1 min sit ups, 1.5 mile run and a weight &amp; height measurement) of 90 or above, and are a generally good Cadet in the eyes of Cadre (the actual commissioned and/or enlisted adults who oversee the program and make sure no one dies), and then how much money headquarters has for that fiscal year for scholarships. 

The leadership is what you make of it. There will be things you strongly disagree or disapprove of and things you are all in for and love. That's just the military and life in general. 

I was a crosstown Cadet from KSU and I can say that it is possible to balance school and fun things with AFROTC, but its difficult. I cant say anything for ASE but I do know that theres definitely a give and take with things like hanging out with friends, priorities of homework vs AFROTC things and you just have to find the right balance that works for you. It took me a month to figure it out and get it right. 

AFROTC classes and activities are on Tech campus :) indoor stuff was in the O'Keefe building and then we marched and drilled at Peter's parking deck. PT was done at the CRC and SAC fields. 

If you need a Cadre member to talk to, you can go onto the GA Tech AFROTC website and find their emails and even schedule an appointment for more information about the program to see if you want to be 110% all in.

comments,"We're going through a similar decision with my son. Here's what we did to narrow the choices.

1) Determine if the school that you're attending is one that you'd like to stay with for 4 years. Most students offered a ""transfer pathway"" to Tech (guaranteed admission as a sophomore if you take certain classes) don't take it, which means that most students get started at a school and stay there - either via inertia or they just like it. Plus, there is no guarantee of admission to Tech as a sophomore even on the pathways. Rules can change, grades may not be what they need to be, schedules may not work out, etc. Keep your options open, but go somewhere that you'll be happy staying for 4 years if needed.

2) Check the transfer requirements for your major. Ever if you aren't on a pathway, it's good to know what Tech will be looking for in a transfer student based on the intended major. The list is [here](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major). Make sure that the school where you are attending can transfer over credit hours in those required courses. Tech has a comprehensive list of what can transfer from schools around the world - [here](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_subj_levl_classes). We found that one of the courses my son would need for the pathway did not have an equivalent course listed at one of his accepted schools. Since he wanted to keep the transfer option open, that school was eliminated from consideration.

3) See if it is possible to take all of those transfer classes as a freshman at the school you're investigating. Sometimes the classes are only offered to sophomores. Sometimes you can get AP credit for them (just make sure that the credit is on your transcript, not just an advanced placement situation). And sometimes schools have a lot of freshman-required classes that may crowd out the ones you need to transfer. Again, you may be able to transfer in without those courses, but they are what Tech has said they are looking for.

4) Make sure you can afford the option. It's a shame to bring up money, but in-state tuition is a great bargain. Not everyone has the option to pay out of state tuition. I'm sure UGA has some fine qualities.

Good luck. Your choice of college does not define you for the rest of your life. You can do great things with degrees from any of your options.",positive,0.9953,positive,0.3589544513457557,04/29/2019

I am a transfer student who recieved an accommodation letter through Georgia State's Regents Center for Learning Disabilities. The evaluation is 8 hours over the course of 2 days performed by a state licensed psychologist. The over all investment was $800 and several months of paper work and doctor visits. So I think is safe to say I have a legitimate disability.. 

***The purpose of extended time is to level the playing field not give 'special privileges'.***

Do I think some students take advantage of this? Yes. However there is a community of students with legitimate disabilities that rely on the ODS and testing center for academic success. If the ODS requires students to recieve specific testing by accredited evaluation centers, then it would be pretty difficult to cheat the system.

The current LTC, I would say, is probably the worst leader I've ever met. He lacks integrity, and also, for some reason, decided to punt on a Title IX case. Rather contemptible. Ask around about that to find out what you really need to know. But, he's not going to be there next semester because he somehow made it to retirement, so, it's no problem for you. Conversely, Captain Clark is a stand-up man and probably one of the best leaders that I have met.

As far as balance, you will find that you are a cadet first, and a college student second. You don't really feel like a college student. I found that it took at least 20 hours a week from me, not counting weekend or extracurricular duties. It was difficult to balance my degree with it, but I don't regret it. I will say, though, that it basically becomes your only life at college. Not such a bad thing considering how close you become with your wingmates. It is a good time.

The Det has a flight sim that you should take advantage of. You submit your NSE packet soon. It is available on the gatech afrotc website, along with information about standards you need to meet. Make sure that you are able to run a 1.5 mi in under 13:30, and meet the weight and health requirements. Now is the time to start training if you do not meet them, because you cannot continue if you fail the PT test twice. Additionally, a word of advice about the medical forms you fill out - don't lie about conditions you're \*certain\* you've been \*diagnosed\* with, don't tell them \*anything\* they don't \*specifically\* ask for, and most importantly, you've never done drugs. And you never will.

Oh, and don't speed between now and then. That'll get you kicked out.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember that you are not ""in"" the air force as a cadet, you are a civilian. Your entire future is completely in flux until you get your dodmerb report back in November and they decide that you are either Qualified to continue, or (permanently) Disqualified to continue and get unceremoniously kicked out during what you thought was a meeting to award you a scholarship.

comments,"I appreciate your thoughtful response, and I understand that there is a need to level the playing field. Unfortunately, I believe (with the caveat that I don’t know about how Georgia tech’s system works specifically) that the current system doesn’t always do a very good job of this. 

There are people like you who use it correctly, but then there are also people who abuse it. The recent college admissions scandal is one example of this (parents literally paid thousands of dollars to get their kids a diagnosis which is unambiguously unethical), but I could easily imagine many of the cases are less clear. You can’t blame parents for wanting the best for their kids, and if they have enough money it would be pretty easy to go from specialist to specialist getting second opinions until finding the answer they want. And they wouldn’t even think they were doing anything wrong necessarily.

On the other end there are plenty of people who probably have similar disabilities to you but are less fortunate and will never get any treatment or accommodations. You said the evaluation took 2 days and cost $800, and that is simply not possible for many families. My mom teaches at a low income elementary school. One year she had a student who was clearly deaf, but it took an entire year and lots of effort on her part to get him an official diagnosis so he could be provided with a hearing aid.

It’s a fine line, and I don’t claim to know the solution, but as far as I can tell the current system is easy for rich people to abuse and makes it really difficult for the people who really need it to get the services they need. I’d be interested to know if anyone has any insights on how to more effectively level the playing field.",positive,0.9788,positive,0.17342592592592593,04/29/2019
comments,"The rate of increase in accommodations doesn't inherently mean an according rate of increase in disabilities in the population, though. More people who need accommodations are using them these days, whether because stigma has been lowered, they're better-informed about what they qualify for (I knew someone who went through 3 years of this school never being able to finish tests because of ADHD before learning that they qualified for accommodations), or that there's been greater effort to recognize a wider range of disabilities. Plus, tons of people with chronic yet itermittent illnesses need to have accommodations even if they don't use them on a day-to-day basis because you have to have the documentation there for a worst-case scenario.

Yeah, it's probably possible to abuse the system, but there is no evidence that it's happening on any scale of concern. There are already enough hurdles in place to getting accommodations that I don't see why anyone would go through it unnecessarily.",negative,-0.4767,positive,0.1125,04/29/2019
comments,"With the whole ""holistic admission"", it is pretty much impossible to predict with 100% certainty who will or will not get in.  Perhaps he wrote some really good essays.  Perhaps he has a good ACT (they only look at the best ACT or SAT, so a bad SAT would be erased by a good ACT).  Perhaps his extracurriculars or recommendation letters spoke to the advisor.  Perhaps he's a really good tight end.

Waitlist and summer admissions mean just that.   They thought he MIGHT be worth admitting, but were waiting to see how many people accepted their admission offers, and might also be wanting to see how they did in more of their  senior year.

He will have to attend in the summer (he can't just decide to wait and start in the fall), but he will be a full GT student and will not be kicked out in the fall.",positive,0.9402,positive,0.24366246498599442,04/29/2019

In my personal opinion extra time would not even help on 95% of exams. You either know the material or you don’t. Sitting there for an extended amount of time is not going to magically make the material appear in your brain.  Yes maybe it would help on standardized tests where time is a critical part like the ACT. But the vast majority of tests I’ve taken at Tech would not be made easier by being given more time. Actually it might make it worse because I might start second guessing myself or I’d have to endure the pain of some of Techs test for a longer time period.

comments,"This was after 2017 I85 bridge collapse and I probably brought this upon myself, but after studying until the morning of the final, I decided to take a short sleep before heading off to take final, and I ended up waking up about 40 minutes late. Trying to hold myself from going into a panic attack, Trying to salvage it, I started heading off school right away. I live about 30 minutes drive away from school and commute, and when there's traffic it takes about 40\~50 minutes and over an hour when it's bad.

Now the bridge repair was still going on, so it almost always took an hour to get to school. Stuck in traffic, I anxiously monitor time, trying to decide where to park to get to the classroom faster and calculating how much time I would have left when I get there. I've noticed one of those rental box truck behind me was looking a bit unstable, breaking hard and late almost running into me, but I was too focused on getting to the classroom to care. But after about 5 minutes, the guy runs right into my rear bumper. 

In disbelief, I walked out of the car, and look at the damage. I was hoping for no damage or just a scratch on paint, so I can just continue heading off, but the bumper was crushed and seemed like it would be a costly repair. I talked to the truck driver. He was obviously dozing off and braked too late because of it, and it turns out he was working for a linen company (something like Cintas, only a smaller local company), and the truck was basically the company vehicle and he was on delivery or something. He insisted that I didn't call the police and talk to the boss lady and that she will make it right with me. I was in a hurry to get to school so I accepted and talked with the company's boss instead of calling and waiting for a police officer to arrive (which turned out to be a bad decision). After exchanging phone numbers I left to go to school.

Even without having the police involved it took me nearly 20\~30 minutes for that exchange and when I finally got to class I only had about 40 minutes left to take the final. I knew at that point that I was never gonna be able to finish the whole exam in time, so I skimmed through the exam to mark whatever seemed easier than others and focused on those first. After turning it in, it was quite clear that I bombed the exam. With all the stress I've just gone through in the last 2 hours or so burned me out completely, and I had to sit down in the commons for a while before heading back home.

That was one of my worst final experiences but turned out to be one of the best finals because after hearing my accident, the professor let me retake the final and I ended up getting an A on the final. So, I guess you never know what would happen.

I even somehow knew something was off, as I had that existential ""oh crap I missed a final"" dread on Monday as I was studying for the final while it was happening. I even messaged my TA to ask when it was, and he said it was Tuesday, but that's because I told him before it was Monday and our professor never really communicated with the TAs so he actually had no clue and just took my word for it. So I assumed everything was just dandy until that night said TA told me that he had received the finals... for grading.

One of our officers did write citations.  We will void all of them.

That generous range is not something I personally ever took advantage of, but I mention It b\\c the grading is arbitrary in grad school a prof can make it as restrictive or large as they want. I just got stuck with a new prof that wants a very restrictive scale.

&gt;One of our officers did write citations.

Look, PTS. I appreciate that you're at least trying to do the right thing here by voiding the citations (good step, and probably would have been a PR disaster had you not).

But really? Your own *director* has essentially zero faith in the students, going as far as to know for certain that this is 100% untrue, when it's literally proven to be true shortly after? 

For all your hopes that the students put their trust and faith in you, you seem to not reciprocate and give any whatsoever to the students. Your immense lack of respect and understanding, exemplified by the **PARKING DIRECTOR** is appalling. 

I can't see any reason why students should even remotely trust a thing you or your directors say at this point, considering that this is only one egg in the basket of disrespect that you try to heap on students without considering their opinions.",positive,0.9693,positive,0.12142857142857141,04/30/2019

comments,"I'm taking Math 1552 right now, so I can only speak for this semester. Overall it's not too bad, but definitely don't fall behind, or you'll need to really cram for the final. Homework due once a week, but easily BS-able because you have infinite tries on MyMathLab and the questions are just changed each time (not advised; source: I did this). The tests and final are all the same throughout the sections (except different for if it's at 8am vs 9am, etc). Lectures three times a week and recitation twice a week so you never get a break. Quizzes during recitation every week you don't have an exam, but are pretty simple in my opinion, and exams are Friday. There are 3 exams, and the lowest counts 10% vs the others that count 10%. Participation/attendance counts 30%.

As for physics, I'm also taking SOUP physics this summer so I really hope it's not too bad.",positive,0.9581,neutral,-0.03644179894179892,04/30/2019
