comments,"Hi everyone! I'm Sidharta Vadaparty, nice to meet you!  
 

I am a senior in CS for Georgia Tech, graduating this Spring and going for Masters in the Fall. I would like to sublease my room from May 12th to August 12th this summer.

The room is available to any one of any gender, LGBTQIA+ friendly. It is a 1B/1B of a 2B/2B unit, and my current roommate will be in the second of the two bedrooms. He is a fellow CS Georgia Tech student. He currently is in a remote internship. He loves music, film, and cooking!

The apartment is fully furnished, and comes with WiFi, utilities, laundry machine unit, and AC.

In addition, the apartment has a kitchen with a stove, oven, sink, and fridge/freezer unit. 

The monthly rent is $1100.

The apartment is 0.75 miles from the Midtown Publix, 0.8 miles from a Target on 18th Street NW, and is 1.6 miles away from Centennial Park (\~13 minutes by bike). All of the Georgia Tech Campus is within reasonable walking distance (only a few blocks away from the apartment).

If you are interested, please DM me to discuss further!

1. Getting the Interview
2. Passing the Interview

If you aren't getting the interview, either fraud/improve your resume. One of my boys his freshman year said he interned at the nonprofit LLC he created just for college apps, and just off of that, he got an internship interview at several FAANG equivalent companies. He also changed his grad date to junior standing cause of AP credits. 

If you aren't passing the interview, it's skill issue. I don't know what types of internships you're applying for, but for SWE interview, it's just leetcode and some bullshit behavioural.

Before an interview take some breaths, tell yourself if you screw up it's not the end of the world. Handle the coding, and tell your interviewer what you really liked about the interview. Ask them good questions.

At top companies, most applicants can pass the technical part. It’s the personal aspects where you can really separate yourself. Especially from GT, we have a reputation for being smart but awkward.

comments,"I'll add to this from a different context. A few points:

1. Approach any interview as a two-way street - you're not only detailing your skills and what you bring to the company, but think about interviewing the company as well - making sure you're asking the questions to help you uncover if this will be a place you can call 'home' for a few years. Taking this approach can help alleviate the nerves you may feel when you're desperate to land that gig. 
2. If at all possible, throughout your career, never leave a job until you have your next one lined up. There's a certain amount of confidence that comes through in your demeanor when you're interviewing, when you realize that you don't HAVE to have that next job. Sure you may want it and are desperately looking to leave the hell-hole that is your current role/company, but knowing you have a way to pay the bills if you don't nail that interview does wonders to your nerves and composure.

Best of luck to you, OP.  And by the way, nothing wrong with having a bit of swagger knowing you have ""Georgia Institute of Technology"" stamped on that degree.",positive,0.9828,neutral,0.007619047619047622,05/01/2023

Take more accountability for your learning if a professor isn't catering to your learning style - you also pay to have access to the professor's office hours (and they'll probably do appointments if you ask), TA's, a tutoring center, maybe PLUS sessions, AND colleagues (other students) going through the same classes - who are probably smarter than you.

comments,"I didn't say ""all"" because I haven't taken every single professor ever, but I'm going to say that ALL of them have demonstrated proficiency in English to get to this point. These people publish papers and went through interviews to get these jobs. They live in America. Is their English always perfect? Probably not! They're human beings and every human being alive has problems communicating no matter what language they speak. There are plenty of ""fluent"" native English-speakers who were born and raised in America and are still terrible at communicating - you go to a school that is notorious for students like this 🙄 

Academic bootlicker 💀💀💀 You don't just sound dumb, you might actually be dumb. Your attitude would probably make sense at a private school; alas, this is a public school. You're paying for a public school with all of the politics and inefficiencies that public institutions have. If you want top-tier then you should go to a private school where you really do pay for everything and your complaints might actually make sense. I'm also in A Lot of debt for school, have to work while attending class, pay a lot of money relative to my income - and I still think you sound entitled. You're right that there is a problem, but your professors' accents are hardly what's actually wrong with this school (or any school).

But hey, maybe you're right! Maybe they should just fire all of the instructors with non-standard accents and make all the students who need those classes to graduate wait however long it takes until they find the perfect All-American professor. Maybe they should actually shut the whole school down while they find the ""perfect"" professor for every course! Then you'd really save your money. 

Also, GT has made it clear from the moment you enroll that they expect you to need help outside of lecture. You think it makes you a bootlicker if you listen to the institute's advice about how they intend for you to succeed in your education? It's not a ""cop out"" to suggest office hours and asking for help. Asking for help is a normal and important life skill. You are so weird.",positive,0.9651,positive,0.056681281681281684,05/02/2023

comments,"GT biology major in their graduating semester of undergrad who will be starting her phd in biochemistry/chemistry at GT this summer! I think I can answer all of your questions.

1. I want to address how much you are comparing yourself to others. This only drags you down and makes it so much harder to truly enjoy your subject. I get it. I'm graduating with barely a 3.0 and have definitely experienced my share of imposter syndrome and burnout. As silly as it sounds, everyone is on their own path and everyone is struggling in their own ways. People might find the classes you struggle with to be easy, and that is ok <3 You are not dumb. Take advantage of the resources and learn to love the learning process. It took a while for me to truly get this in my head. It really REALLY helped to actually get involved with research and realize that research is not about how well you test but how hard you work and how curious you are. Validation from my research mentors also really made me see that no one was valuing me for my grades but instead how interested I was in the research itself.
2. Mental health is hard. It is ok for your gpa to drop. Mine finally stopped dropping when I stopped caring more about grades than my health. I joined (nonacademic) clubs and got myself a fulfilling social life. That did wonders for my overall attitude towards school.
3. I got into grad school with barely a 3.0 because I did undergrad research and have a great relationship with my undergrad PI (as well as a few other professors in the chem department here). My PI was very open to me staying in his lab for grad school and pushed for my application to be accepted. Again, super cliche, but pursue what you love and things will work out for you. Passion and genuine curiosity very much out weigh grades. Sure, a good gpa increases your options, but sometimes a good gpa is not possible. That will not be the end of the world. You got this <3

comments,"I'm in grad AE. I know a lot of other AE grad students that haven't taken AE as an undergrad. I did mechanical engineering in my undergrad. Some of my fellow AE grad students have only done Biomedical, Computer Science, Physics, and more. They haven't taken any AE courses or related courses at all and in fact, the first semester was probably their first time taking any type of ME/AE course. For these students though, I imagine the content might be a bit difficult to grasp at first. I know I've seen a few professors who are actually looking for students with strong skills I'm computational methods, which they don't really teach to AE undergrads here or elsewhere. You'll probably just have to take the intro courses on fluids if you join the AE program. The requirements to graduate are really student dependent. There's no specific classes you need to take, just the amount of classes. But you want those classes to be useful for you and not a waste of time.

The general requirement is like 4 AE classes, 2 math classes, a seminar class, and a bunch of electives you choose to take in whichever college you want. If you look up the GT AE graduate student handbook, there's a lot of good information there.

comments,"I just interviewed a few prospective interns at the startup I intern for, and I 1000% agree that focusing too hard on having perfect answers or letting your nerves get the best of you will make the interview process challenging for everyone. Relax, relax, relax - getting the interview means we're already interested! Now we need to get to know you :)

We didn't interview for a SWE position or anything like that, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt please! But I hope it helps to hear some of what the other side could be thinking as they interview you, especially if you end up choosing a startup.

It was pretty easy to assess whether someone had the technical skills we wanted, so we were really focused on higher level judgements we could make about the person, such as whether they had a growth mindset or could talk about their past experiences with wisdom or insight (aka critical thinking skills). 

e.g. ""the project was successful, but it was most rewarding to have grown more confident in my coding abilities, which helped me in later projects...""
""it was incredible to know that the project had this specific impact on the operations of the business...""
""the experience taught me about my own leadership style, and as a result, I have been working to improve xyz...""

...etc etc! Not real answers but the idea is hopefully there.


I was really interested in learning about how each candidate solved problems or thought about the world - when you don't know how to start or continue with a project, what do you do? What have you done in the past? Are you collaborative, and do you know how to ask for help? Obviously I asked more open-ended questions to get them to talk about these themes, but I hope you get the idea. There wasn't a specific answer I was looking for; I just wanted to know what they were like.

My interview partner and I agreed that we weren't looking for someone who came off as a people pleaser - the interview was the first communication we had, so we wanted the candidates to present the version of themself that would show up to work as our colleague everyday, not a polished version trying to fake it just to get the job, you know? Unfortunately it is pretty apparent when people are being inauthentic, so my honest advice is to sincerely think about what you value, and use your core values to guide your interview responses. The candidates we ended up choosing were the ones who were the most comfortable and sincere in their responses. They had personal motivations outside of money, or a sense of greater purpose/passion that was conveyed through their responses and behavior. I picked one candidate because I trusted that their curiosity and respectfulness during the interview would translate to their everyday behavior at work. 

Their demeanor outside of what they said was pretty important, too. One candidate looked away from the camera/screen frequently, and didn't seem very excited about or inspired by anything that was said. While I'm sure they might have been nervous or just in the habit of looking across the room while they spoke, it was not a very engaging conversation even though we were talking about experiences that should have been meaningful for them. It made us feel disconnected from them socially. In isolation we would have been willing to overlook it, but in comparison to the candidates who made the effort to look and sound engaged with their body language, it was a pretty important deciding factor. 

Again, my perspective is shaped by being in a start-up, so this is probably completely different for say, a larger FAANG-level company. Start-ups are a great opportunity to grow as a leader and gain personal life experience that will make your future jobs easier to apply for and transition into. If you end up with one, use that opportunity to grow as a person! Figure out what motivates you outside of money or status, and let that confidence carry you through your career. 

I know it's cheesy, but it really is true when they say rejection is just redirection. They probably weren't the right fit for you either - that's okay!  You are valuable and deserve to be in a work environment where you feel respected and fulfilled. 

You'll end up where you need to be. Be proud of the things you've done and who you've become, and be sure to celebrate when you land your first offer! Best of luck 💖",positive,0.9996,positive,0.25525824175824186,05/02/2023

comments,"I will graduate in a few days and, if I didn't fail one of the classes, I will transition into being a physics grad student here. My gpa last semester was 3.5. I don't think it mattered much either way. One thing I would say is get into a lab as soon as you can. Undergraduate research is basically a prerequisite and opens up a lot of internship opportunities. I had an internship position at a national lab thanks to my advisor. It also helps you build connections with faculty and might even help you identify your PI before you even begin a PhD (my case).

And yeah, being a GT undergrad improves your chances significantly. Just don't let the feeling of inadequacy grind you down.",positive,0.9532,neutral,-0.011507936507936503,05/02/2023

I'd say try to get an internship before graduation to diversify your experience and have more items on your CV. However, if you think you may get to publish or co-author a paper with Goldman, then that'd be tremendous. Generally, publications trump absolutely everything else during admissions. That said, if you're planning to stay at Tech, then it doesn't really matter as long as you get a very good recommendation from Goldman and make a good impression on other professors.

Also, if you're considering working for some time before getting a PhD, I'd recommend looking into getting a postbac at a national lab. They pay relatively well (as compared to PhD stipends), you'll be working in a lab, and they often have funding opportunities when you transition to PhD (with stipulations of completing your postdoc there).

comments,"As I've mentioned elsewhere, this is my tenth class in 6 semesters.

I don't expect to be treated like a golden child. I'm also a distance learning student so I have always had reasonable accomodations like having 48 hours to take an exam or same day if it's online. He asked for these to be proctored so I needed to find a proctor open late enough and then go in to take it. It's also understandable if those quizzes are on the syllabus, but they weren't. I'd also be understanding if they were on honorlock or some other service so I could take them as soon as I had 40 minutes, but I had to coordinate a proctor which is a grade A pain in the ass.


The bigger part of the problem with the honor code situation isn't that he caught the people who messed up, he basically made it impossible to gain an understanding of the material by discussing the assignment with other students. That would be fine if you could ask him for help.

And you are right about the low GPA. Any other class I've had where the class was struggling, the professor would take notice of it and ask what they or the TA could do to help. He didn't. Asking him for help was like hitting golf balls into the ocean, you probably weren't getting any support. The TA didn't know the material. Neither the TA nor professor held office hours for online students that were easily accessible. Asking for additional material that you could reference was always denied.

I'm not saying the professor should have held my hand, but I expect him to at least give me the answers to the homework or quizzes so I could reference them and learn from them. I also expect practice problems or supplemental material that you can use as a life raft if the lecture slides aren't working or making sense. 

I think I aced my last test today so I'm praying for the best. Based on what I've heard from the other students, I needed to get a low grade on it to pass.

I want to add one more thing. It's unacceptable to me that my program decides to continue letting this professor teach this course. He's not testing or teaching relevant knowledge but going on diatribes about tools that have been in use since the 1990s",positive,0.7419,positive,0.07775974025974026,05/03/2023

There are some underclassmen programs that aren’t specifically for minorities. Putting a reasonable graduation date seems fine to me, depending on your credits it’s possible to graduate in less than 4.

comments,"I’m a bit late to this thread, but I think i can give some helpful perspectives on this. For context, I’m graduating with my PhD from GT this weekend. I’m not actually in the physics department, but my undergrad major was in physics. I graduated with a 3.3 from undergrad and getting that degree was one of the toughest periods in my life for my mental health.

The GPA for grad school will depend a lot on where you apply and the program. Please also understand you don’t have to go to a physics program. There are many research topics, fields, and programs that use physics and are happy to take physics majors. Also, its generally considered bad to stay in the same school for both undergrad and grad. There are exceptions to this, but you’ll get less diversity of thought and perspective in your education if you dont change institutions.

On this note, what part of physics do you like? Physics is broad. You should identify some areas or sub-disciplines you’re interested in, as that will affect the advice you get for both grad school and industry/government jobs. 

Lastly, on the topic of classmates. As a VERY broad generalization (and speaking as one), physics majors can be conceited assholes. IDK what it is, but people who like to boast about how smart they are or minimize the academic struggles of others, tend to go into physics…. Classmates making you feel lesser or sub-par is an indication about THEM not you. When I changed departments for grad school, I stopped experiencing the same effect you describe. YOU ARE NOT DUMB.

Thanks for the response! For context as to why I want to pursue grad school here, I've been moving around and changing countries my entire life (lived in 9 different countries), and now that I'm in the US I kinda fell in love with Atlanta and Georgia Tech (as much as it's torture to be here). It very much reminds me of my home city of Naples, Italy as there are similar stories (the north burning down Atlanta, like in Naples with Regno delle due Sicillie vs the north), and so I'd love to see the South continue to develop and progress.

I recall my physics advisor during faset saying plenty of brilliant undergrads end up going to Harvard/Princeton/MIT/Caltech etc despite how happy they would have been to keep them at tech. I was thinking after that that if I ever do make it to a point where I can apply to a grad school, it most certainly will be gt.

Also I see what you mean about surrounding myself with people who don't put me down, I do have a really good friend in my physics class and I should definitely find more people like them :)) This made me feel better that it wasn't just me and that it's not a problem with me, thank you very much !",positive,0.9829,positive,0.1680269841269841,05/04/2023

comments,"Hi :))

I was accepted as an electrical engineering undergraduate, but I'm considering changing my major to computer engineering or maybe computer science. To get some insight, I've read some posts on this subreddit, and people said it's hard for ECE students to take CS classes because of major restrictions or smth. Is it still true? cuz the posts were written around 4 years ago. Anyway, I hope to get a job related to chip design for phones and computers. But I'm not entirely sure about it yet, so I was wondering if it would be better for me to major in computer science and do a 'thread' related to chip design stuff since, as I said, it seems like ECE students have a hard time registering for CS courses. I want to get educated on both hardware and software. So, my question is Would it be better for me to major in computer science or computer engineering or just stick to EE?

There is no direct relationship between the percent score and your final letter grade. Some professors list the cutoffs in their syllabus, others keep it more ambiguous.

In the mid 90s the ChemE department was caught so flat footed by technological advances that in my 2nd year my numerical methods class was still teacing us methods using basic FORTRAN on VAX terminals (this would have been 1996, before the olympics).

I don't think anyone back then except for the old school CS types were still using VAX machines for coursework/productivity.

Granted, they were more or less forced to get their shit together... by 1998 or so we had a PC cluster in the Bunger-Henry building with Matlab, Excel, and Hysys installed on all the machines (and zip drives....remember those? LOL).

The switch from quarters to semesters ended up a bit of a mess because lots of classes didn't have time to combine all the required material into a curriculum for students like me who started under quarters but finished under semesters.   They dropped a physical chemistry requirement that existed under quarters for a lot of us because there was no room to shoehorn it into the new semester curriculum for folks who were close to graduating.",negative,-0.3128,positive,0.05942760942760943,05/05/2023

comments,"The only part I remember of my class now was the FORTRAN programming (useful for me as i'd never learned about data types like arrays nor ever used a compiler or a debugger) and the bit about not using too many degrees of freedom to model data.

&#x200B;

They didn't teach us Matlab until we had to use it for project control lab and maybe reactor design (unsure if that was the exact class...i'd have to check my old transcripts).   I wouldn't call it useless.... it gave me enough of a basis of how to use Matlab so that I could easily help a friend complete their community college matlab project... but i've never touched Matlab since.

Giving us access to Hysys was a big benefit, IMO.  The real tragedy was not teaching us advanced/intermediate Excel skills which would 100% have made senior design projects less work to complete.

Pivot tables, v/hlookup functions, indirect, conditional formatting, index, match, countif, etc....    if you haven't learned how to use those then do yourself a favor and become familiar.      If you ever get a job doing lots of computation, then an actual programming language (like Python) or a purpose built program might be more efficient.... but Excel worksheets are great for showing your work and formatting results into documents and reports.",positive,0.9784,positive,0.17598039215686279,05/05/2023

comments,"The sad thing is while this is impressive, it’s definitely not “arguably the most ambitious project ever attempted by GT Students”. 

There are, I bet, thousands of post grad students working on groundbreaking research on topics which would be way more ambitious. 

Meanwhile they’re labeling a milestone in a rocket launch as more ambitious even though launching of rockets a very popular in industry (thanks Mr Musk and Mr Bezos) on top of which GT has a very well endowed AE program where students learn to do this and more impressive stuff as well.

Don’t get me wrong: it’s definitely impressive that they managed to do this as students given that it probably required a lot of funding and knowing the right people to get permits and whatnot. I’m not trying to be cynical in that regard. But it’s like (taking it into the CS/ ECE domain because I’m a bit more familiar) someone fabricating their own 8-but CPU. It’d be amazing that they managed to do it given that normal people don’t have access to the tools required etc to do it in everyday life but we all learned how to do it in our classes. It’s an impressive feat, not ambitious.

Again, good work guys! But maybe be a bit more humble next time? Just having only the second sentence in that caption would’ve made all the difference.

The fact that you're asking ""what happens if I get nailed for this again""  is a pretty bad look, IMO.

&#x200B;

Keep in mind that the institute is fully capable of revoking your status as a student for any violation.  They don't have to just give you a zero on the assignment or in the class.

Obviously this will vary by discipline and lab, so I would recommend shopping around to different groups to see if there’s something you’d like.

comments,"Speaking as a former TA — but not as someone from the office of student integrity, whose website you should be consulting for definitive answers — I doubt you’re **guaranteed** to go through probation if you commit a repeat offense. Of course it depends on the “seriousness” of the academic integrity violation, but they are not going to overlook a prior warning if you get caught again. 

And, speaking as a former international student — I’m also familiar with another international student who was put on academic probation after changing their answer to a test question and requesting a regrade. They got a zero on the test in question, put on disciplinary probation, and warned that any future incidents during the rest of their studies would result in an immediate suspension that would terminate their F-1 status. 

You’re required to be enrolled in a full courseload throughout the fall/spring to be physically present in the US on an F-1 visa, so if you get caught again, you might have to pack your bags and say goodbye to the United States.",negative,-0.3612,positive,0.0659090909090909,05/08/2023

comments,"Firstly the government isn’t on the brink of a shutdown like you often hear of in the news. That happens when a budget or continuing resolution hasn’t been passed. We have a budget for FY2023 that is in place so no government shutdown in that sense is on the horizon.

The debt ceiling is likely to be raised. I’d love to say they’ll 100% do it but there’s no guarantee with how insane politics has been the last 5+ years. So in this sense I really wouldn’t be very worried about a default, it’s very unlikely to happen. In fact there’s debate that it might even be unconstitutional to default, so whether congress acts or not it’ll probably be ok.

Lastly, if we do default on our debt it won’t matter who you work for. There’s a strong chance it will cause the largest depression in US history, orders of magnitude worse than the Great Depression. You’ll be out of a job and the US dollar will be worthless, so might as well be out of a job with the government.",negative,-0.9037,neutral,0.0023809523809523725,05/08/2023

I switched from EE to CompE my second year here, and I’m entering my last year.

It is definitely tough to register for CS classes as a CompE, since there is no priority for CompE majors. However, any CS classes that are absolutely required you should have no trouble registering for (CS1301, 1331, 1332, 2050). 

Once you choose your threads, you’ll have an option of courses, both ECE and CS, that you can take. Although as you mentioned, you’ll likely only be able to register for ECE classes for the reasons you mentioned. Realistically this shouldn’t be too much of a concern until your 3rd or 4th year.

Since you might want to do chip design, you might lean more towards CompE. I think a thread in Computing Hardware and Emerging architectures sounds great for you. Additionally, as a CompE you have the option of taking either 2 CompE threads, 1 CompE thread + 1 CS Thread, or 1 CompE thread + 1 EE thread. The list of threads you can take are listed [here](https://ece.gatech.edu/computer-engineering-degree)
If you do pick a CS thread, you will get priority for the CS classes for that thread. Some CompE threads do have CS classes as options, you don’t get priority for those.

This is an unconventional take, but try some combination of the following: removing seed oils from diet, more UV exposure, and putting tallow or lanolin on your acne.

https://www.acne.org/forums/4-prescription-acne-medications/363864-my-f19-accutane-telogen-effluvium-journey-pics/paged/3

> I was afraid to use Accutane for the cystic acne I'd had for 5+ years, and said no at first but my dermatologist continued to pressure me to use it, claiming that it was ""safer than long-term antibiotics"" (false). I was also told so many lies about the risks: ""no long-term effects"", except ""very very rare"" (1/10,000) liver damage or night vision loss, and (of course) birth defects. I was told no serious effects happen with a low-dose (lies). My doctor denied all the other possible serious effects, saying they were never proven. With false reassurances, I decided to try at low dose 10mg/day. No bad effects, so I took 20mg/day. Dry skin + lips, but nothing serious. After 5 months, I developed minor/moderate side effects: minor hair shedding, mild ankle pain, and lower mood. I stopped the drug early, but the damage was already done. The serious effects all started 5-6 months AFTER stopping! My body became destroyed overnight: extreme joint damage + clicking/pain in every joints/tendons/ligaments, loss of 75% of my hair, dry eyes, floaters, light sensitivity, headaches, insane chronic fatigue, partial paralysis in extremities, extreme brain fog/memory problems, stiff neck + spine, nerve damage, neuropathy, slow-healing wounds, painfully dry skin. Years later, these effects are all permanent and have only worsened. The discs in my spine are all degenerated and my rheumatologist says I have the spine of a 70-year old. These effects don't run in my family at all and I don't have autoimmune issues or any other diseases. Every doctor I've seen has gaslit me saying it's not accutane, but thousands of people have the same experience as me. The insert doesn't mention that permanent effects can start months or years after stopping the drug. I have extreme disabling pain 24/7 that never goes away. It's so severe that it's difficult to walk short distances or do dishes. Even a low dose of accutane can ruin your life, regardless if you monitor it carefully and have bloodwork. Delayed onset effects can happen months or years after stopping the drug.

> I took Accutane back in 1999 at the age of 15, I’m now 37. During the first course, all I had was super dry skin. My dermatologist wasn’t satisfied with the results so he put me on a second course, which is when all of my problems started. I started having frequent diarrhea and stomach pain, and it took years to figure out that I have chronic inflammation of the ileum, which is where the small and large intestines meet. My symptoms increased over the years to the point where I’m now pretty much stuck in my house because I can be feeling fine one minute and then have severe symptoms the next. If I feel the urge to use the restroom, I have about 15-20 seconds to find a toilet or I won’t be able to hold it and my body will just go without me having any control. I 100% blame this on Accutane because I was in perfect health before I took the drug. I also experience severely dry lips that no moisturizer helps, migraines, fibromyalgia and brain fog that gets so bad at times that I literally think I have early onset Alzheimer’s. Accutane took away my quality of life and should not be allowed to be prescribed to anyone. And after doing research many years ago, I found that Accutane was originally developed as a chemotherapy drug and when they saw that it was clearing up people’s skin, they decided to change it and call it an acne medication. It’s chemotherapy, it will kill not only bad cells but good ones too and the damage is irreparable!!",negative,-0.9993,neutral,0.029921875,05/08/2023

The general advice a dermatologist will give you: salicylic acid peels, glycolic acid, isotretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, etc. can be horribly damaging and irritating to skin and/or damage your gut.

When working on skincare, ask if yourself if the right conditions are there? Does the degree of polyunsaturated fats in your diet, which are readily absorbed as humans do not hydrogenate fats with the help of bacteria like a cow, affect what types of microbes grow on your face when oil is produced? Does a lack of sunlight allow bad bacteria to grow? etc.

comments,"> Don’t get me wrong: it’s definitely impressive that they managed to do this as students given that it probably required a lot of funding and knowing the right people to get permits and whatnot. I’m not trying to be cynical in that regard. But it’s like (taking it into the CS/ ECE domain because I’m a bit more familiar) someone fabricating their own 8-but CPU. It’d be amazing that they managed to do it given that normal people don’t have access to the tools required etc to do it in everyday life but we all learned how to do it in our classes. It’s an impressive feat, not ambitious.

No university team (at least as far as I know) has successfully launched a liquid fueled rocket to space. I'd say that makes the project/goal rather ambitious, given that it's uncharted territory for university students. I'm sure that learning how to do these kinds of things in courses is very, very different from doing it in the real world at their scale.

That said, I agree that it isn't the most ambitious project ever, but I don't think that it's fair to say that it isn't ambitious.",positive,0.9535,positive,0.2732919254658385,05/08/2023

Just send the professor an email, encourage your classmates to do the same if they also see NR, and between all the student emails and the registrar beating down their door the professor should fix it pretty quick.",positive,0.296,positive,0.14351851851851852,05/09/2023

I was offered a secure transfer admission to Georgia Tech for Fall 2024 as part of the Talent Initiative Pathway. I plan on pursuing Aerospace Engineering. 

  
During my freshman year, I'll be taking Calc III and Differential Equations. I understand that the only necessary math credits I need to transfer are Calc I and II, but I heard that many aerospace majors at Tech take Intro to Linear Algebra during their freshman year. Is Linear Algebra something I should be familiar with prior to taking Aerospace courses at Tech? Should I plan to take Linear Algebra during my freshman year or during Summer 2024?

It kinda sounds like if you defer you probably have a straightforward path back in. I’d absolutely recommend taking the internship.

Their office reaches out to a group of people on Monday before the grade turn in deadline with a list of all the outstanding grades asking others to help get grades turned in. They also contact the professors directly, but they do multiple things to try to get all the grades turned in. I also want to add that sometimes life happens. So sometimes grades can get delayed when either the professor or a TA has life happen... which can cause delays. Finally, and I say this with personal experience, for some reason I couldn't upload grades for a while. The system wouldn't let me log in. So instead I had to find someone in the Registrars office to help me (at a time when they are insanely busy) and then figure out the appropriate way to get the spreadsheet to them without any FERPA violations.",positive,0.8185,neutral,-0.008333333333333344,05/11/2023

comments,"I graduated in 2020 and took a job in the Boston area. I'm in Medford now, a few miles from downtown. Some random advice I can think of:


* Driving is ludicrous in this town. The roads are old and laid out seemingly randomly, and drivers are more aggressive than anywhere else in the country. Personally I've grown to love the Masshole driving culture, it feels very efficient, but it is ROUGH when you're starting out. Compared to Atlanta it's a similar amount of traffic volume just with a fucked road layout and drivers who aren't fucking around.


* Public transit is much better than Atlanta, but still crumbling and unreliable. The subway trains in particular are a wreck, to the point where the fed is having to step in and dictate slow zones/maintenance. The commuter rail is doing a bit better if you're looking at options further outside the city. The system is usable, but plan for lots of extra time. Also FYI the silver line is not a real train, it's a bus in a tunnel masquerading as a train. And the green line has like 5 branches which is really confusing at first.


* If you at all want to get out and about the city, avoid living in East Boston. It is geographically isolated from the rest of the city by the harbor, and the main tunnel connecting it to Boston is being closed for maintenance this summer and next summer. The tunnel has a toll which means some Ubers/Uber Eats refuse to cross it. There is a train connection to down town, but concerns from above apply.


* There is a ton of great seafood and Italian food here! Check out the North End for the ""authentic"" Italian section of Boston, but be aware there are a lot of tourist traps there too. Weirdly there is no good pizza in this city, Italian or otherwise.


* The aquarium is way less cool than Atlanta's, but they do have a ton of penguins of you like those.


* If you are going to be driving a moving truck at all, PAY ATTENTION TO BRIDGE HEIGHTS. Particularly on Storrow Drive. This city peels the tops off a lot of U-Hauls.


* Nightlife is pretty mediocre for the most part. This city is asleep by 1am (trains stop running, bars close, nothing else is open). That was similar to Atlanta in my experience but depending on where you're originally from might seem early. You'll probably have the best luck near the universities in Cambridge.


* Highly recommend getting out on the water, there's tons of options: Kayak rentals from Paddle Boston, duck boats, sailing charters, or even a ferry ride. I believe there's ferries to cape cod and Martha's vineyard which are both cool places in the summer.


* New England states are teeny tiny, so you could pop over to some other states like Vermont or Maine on Amtrak if you want to do more exploring. This is the one corner of the country where Amtrak is viable, so take advantage of it!


* If your office is located in Seaport, my condolences lol. That is the hardest place to commute in and out of imo. It is a VERY nice area though (and VERY expensive).

comments,"I'm an incoming summer transfer student majoring in CS. I really messed up by not sending my AP scores directly from College Board, as I was under the impression that the AP course credit listed on my transcript would suffice. At orientation, my advisor told me I needed to send in my scores, so I did, but they won't arrive until after the registration period ends. I was planning on taking CS 1331 this summer, but since my AP credit for CS 1301 isn't in yet, I'm unable to register for it. This is a huge problem for me, as the classes I was planning on taking in the Fall have CS 1331 as a prerequisite. My question is: if I took the CS 1331 placement exam, which is apparently offered on August 22nd, would I be able to register for the classes that have CS 1331 as a prerequisite in the Fall?",positive,0.4945,positive,0.12500000000000003,05/12/2023

They recently extended the north side of the green line so there's a lot of outdated maps floating around still, including the ones physically posted throughout the system lol. Google Maps with all the transit options enabled is probably your best bet for the most part. Generally though, this is where the different lines will take you:

Blue - runs from downtown to everything east of Boston, including the airport and East Boston. Worth noting that the airport stop is still annoyingly far from the terminal, you will have to take a (free) shuttle.

Orange - suburbs to the north and south

Red - primary line for Cambridge which means lots of students and professionals. Probably the busiest line of all. Also goes pretty far south east of the city, but annoyingly doesn't go through Seaport.

Green - fills a gap between Orange and Red in the north, then branches to cover the entire west side of the city. There are lots of shopping/touristy places along the western part of this line. 

Silver - A partially underground bus that connects the airport to the Seaport and some areas close to downtown.",positive,0.6652,positive,0.09565217391304347,05/12/2023

That doesn't mean just looking up a lab that you're interested in, but also taking a look at the professors who work there and their active research projects. Find someone who's doing what you're interested in. Find of the lab has an opening. Some groups send out their open positions at the start of the semester to everyone.

Then I would suggest reading some abstracts of that professors recent publications. You don't need to understand the ins and outs of what they're doing but it gives a better understanding about the problems they're trying to solve. 

You could then meet with the people working in the lab. Meet with the professor/grad students to discuss your interest. Helps if the professor has taught one of your classes: then they are familiar with your knowledge and abilities. Try to highlight that you pick things up fast, are organized, detail oriented and meticulous. It's definitely possible to get research as an undergrad, I did it for 2 years in the ASDL",positive,0.9802,positive,0.1560897435897436,05/14/2023

comments,"From what I've seen, ML is a very broad field. Just wanted to share my thoughts/understanding but feel free to comment:

One way could be that you can work on say ML Infra teams at companies that actually maintain the systems that power model development as a SWE. You can develop an understanding of what it takes to build ML systems that scale (computing resources, optimizations, etc are very important). You can use that experience as a springboard to jump into say ML Engineering roles (ive heard from my network of people internally transferring from SWE role to ML eng role through team changes) where you can work on model development

Alternatively, you can try looking for teams where you can work closely with data scientists, product managers, ML Engineers. This type of environment can allow you to setup coffee chats with the type of people who are in the role you want to get to eventually and can offer valuable advice.

If you want to do research without having the course under your belt, read up on the field and work on projects that apply knowledge that you would have gotten in XYZ classes. 

Look into [REUs](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/). These are summer experiences where you work on a research project with a professor/grad student at another university.

It sounds like you’re looking for reasons not to apply, but this wouldn’t be a great one. No transfer application is guaranteed, and of course it has to be a competitive process, but Tech doesn’t really have a reputation for being unable to accept transfer students due to capacity alone. It’s a matter of them having X slots available and yours being among the best X applications among those received. The only way you know for a fact that you won’t be admitted is if you don’t even try.

comments,"hm, I was confused by your `≠`. If your advisor isn't super helpful, I would ask the BS/MS coordinators, since they know the most

In general, if you have the means it makes sense to get MS out of the way before you start a career. I imagine it is difficult for people to handle full-time job + 1/2 classes a semester, and you miss out on campus stuff. I am not familiar with PhD programs.

I assume you want to do BS/MS either because you think it is easier to get in, or because you want to carry over credits from undergrad.

You could maybe do non-school stuff Fall 23 and finish undergrad in Spring 24, taking as many double-counting classes as you can.

If you want to take classes both semesters, you might be able to get more credits that could count in MS. An extra BS semester won't be wasted if it moves up MS graduation by a semester. However, there are some things to consider:

- How many classes are you planning to double-count using the BS/MS program? You may also be able to single-count some ""fall-through"" courses; that is, 4000-lvl classes that you take in undergrad, ones that don't count towards your BS degree. For example, you could take a class in Fall 23 and then take an equivalent credit to replace it in Spring 24; then try to get your advisor to classify the first one as fall-through, and apply the second one as a double-count through BS/MS. Haven't read the rules recently, but it's worth asking about.

- If you are planning to pursue MS Thesis, that replaces 4/10 of your classes (12/30 credit hours). 6 remaining classes is not a lot, which is good and also bad. I'm in Systems specialization (18 credits have to be chosen from Systems list) and doing Project option (9 credits), so 30-18-9=3 ""free elective"" credit hours. Other specializations may have fewer core / specialization elective requirements (usually 15 credits total), but you are doing Thesis so yeah, *you will only have __0-1 classes__ that will count towards MS __outside your specialization__*. You need to start planning *now* on your MS specialization and what BS courses you can take that will actually count towards it.",positive,0.9762,positive,0.10272435897435897,05/15/2023

They do let individual students calibrate their own personal confidence in themselves (ex: if you did poorly or had to get help on it, you know what to study more or ask about in office hours).

Tests, however, are designed to determine what you managed to learn and retain, which is why they are weighted so heavily.

My best advice from someone who failed this class two semesters in a row: become good at memorizing the coding portions. I am good at critical thinking, but bad at remembering things.

Maybe with each data structure / algorithm, you can create a “half page” guide of the entire thing to summarize it after you’ve learned it. All of these come in really handy when prepping for the final so you can quickly memorize :) I’m assuming ur talking about 1332, but 1331 same could apply.

comments,"Hey! I just transferred in under conditional for this semester from Clayton State, so I'll try my best to give you some advice!

From my understanding, it sounds like you're heading into your freshman year. So I'll try to help you from my experience in your shoes.

First off, your major at GSU doesn't matter once you apply - around November, you'll gain access to Tech's application portal where you'll be able to re-apply as a transfer student. It's here where you'll upload a copy of an unofficial transcript, and most importantly - select your major for admission at Tech. At Clayton, I was a CS major - but here, I'm a Computer Engineering major. I think they asked something about my major on the application, but I don't think it was for any other reason but to verify what you've told them. From my understanding - Tech only cares about your GPA, the classes you've taken, and the amount of classes you've taken (minimum of 30 hours *Post-Highschool*).

I do want to note that it's super important to at least enroll in a major that's kind of close to what you want to do for registration purposes at GSU. For example, I'd have to imagine a communications major would have issues getting into higher level math classes. You've got plenty of time before you'll need to restart the admissions process, [but mostly just make sure you've taken these classes and have at least a 3.3 STEM and overall GPA](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major).

Also, reach out to [GSU's REPP/Dual-degree coordinat](https://perimeter.gsu.edu/rep/)[or](https://perimeter.gsu.edu/rep/) for help! They've got special back channels to ask GT's admissions department questions directly! But I'd also recommend that you go ahead and email the undergraduate admissions office just to verify.

I'm here for help if you need it - so please don't hesitate to reach out to me, either by responding here or PM-ing me!

Best of luck!",positive,0.9954,positive,0.2396152210884354,05/16/2023

comments,"Off-campus yes, on-campus no. Getting in trouble for it on-campus could put you in a tough spot if you don't have someone else who could keep the cat (such as your parents). You should avoid any course of action that might end with you returning the cat to the shelter - this is very stressful for the cat and Atlanta shelters are always stretched thin. Think about your long-term plans - who keeps the cat for breaks? After graduation? In 10, maybe 15 years?

Litter boxes need regular upkeep (daily or every other day) and sometimes they smell no matter what you do. Sometimes the cat will track litter everywhere (like my silly kitty does), and regular vacuuming and cleaning will be needed. Can you feasibly handle these things in a dorm?

Cats need playtime, exercise and attention - can you guarantee those needs will be met everyday? It's true that they don't need as much floor space as a dog would, but they still have enrichment needs, and vertical space goes a long way for them. Can you guarantee them a safe place to hide or take time alone? 

Also, a LOT of people have cat allergies to varying degrees. All of you would have to be considerate about your guests and people you come into close contact with.

I highly, highly recommend fostering before you try to adopt - the shelter will cover all of the foster cat's expenses, including healthcare, and you and your roommates will have the opportunity to assess whether having a permanent forever cat is still a good idea. I've fostered around 20 cats (not at one time) in the last year at my off-campus apartment, which technically has a pet rental fee, but they have never actually charged me for it. I use Lifeline Animal Services; I typically visit the locations in Chamblee, but they have one nearby (Fulton County Animal Services), and I think they recently opened a new location where the Atlanta Humane Society used to be.",positive,0.9655,neutral,0.010632323232323224,05/16/2023
comments,"Yes, all REPP courses completed along with around 6 extra classes giving a total of 60 credits. 

The application process can be very luck dependent. What most likely killed my application was not having the unpaid community work. So, I am guessing that the reviewers do not really care about your jobs and would prefer to see more unpaid community work instead. This also means that GPA and credits probably have less of a pull (above the typical transfer average of a 3.7 GPA and 55 credits) than by selling yourself by your community service. 

You could still get in, but I would not put full faith into it due to the holistic review process being uncertain. I was mistakenly led to believe that being in REPP, in-state, working 30 hours per week, and on top of my above average GPA and credit hours would get me in. 

If you plan on applying try to get as much community service completed to really stand out. You could very well get in if so.",positive,0.3562,positive,0.09053030303030302,05/16/2023

But if you find yourself reading off of your doc like it's a script, then consider bullet points or even pictures to jog your memory so that you speak about it more naturally and authentically.  Practicing your presentation skills would be helpful here if you find it difficult to form your thoughts without a script. 

I know that not everyone finds meaning or purpose in working, but if you can, identifying what makes you passionate can really elevate your confidence and make it less stressful to interview. Someone I know chose their major because they watched a loved one get a prosthetic leg and learn to live with it, and now they are passionate about low-cost medical devices. Maybe you have a story that is true to you and shows the interviewer that you're not just looking for a paycheck, and that you have potential to be a good colleague and asset for the company. 

Maybe another useful exercise is to think about what you would like to see in a candidate - think about group mates and classmates you've had in the past that you thought underperformed, or performed really well. What qualities made them ideal to work with? What made them difficult? You can consider how you embody the qualities that you admire in other people and tailor your responses around that. 

Be kind to yourself, and try to take lessons away from every interview experience you've had. You've got this!!!!!!",positive,0.996,positive,0.19596508563899867,05/16/2023

comments,">I don’t have anything helpful to add, but like why are we paying a dining-related student center fee when they’re basically closed (a few exceptions for limited hours near lunchtime, at one or two places).

The Student Center fees do not relate to dining specifically. The two fees we pay are related to operations of the building itself and the debt service to pay it off, neither of which stop during the summer and the fees are lower than spring.",negative,-0.4798,negative,-0.0673469387755102,05/16/2023

We all have our own journeys in college because we all want different things. Are you comparing yourself to people who are aiming to do the exact same things as you when they graduate? If so, don't compare what you're doing in a negative tone. Ask yourself if what you're doing is getting you the relevant skills and experience you need for your particular future. 


Every year, I set personal and professional goals for myself. Every activity, project, and internship I did aimed to accomplish those goals. For example, I noticed that going into my 4th year, my GPA was lower for grad school admissions. My goal was to raise it, so I focused on classes and worked half time for two semesters to meet that. Focusing on the journey of other people is noise and unnecessary as it has nothing to do with you.

comments,"I think it's really important and good that you're talking about this. I'll start with the research side of things since that's what I'm most qualified to talk about. The point of undergraduate research is to learn new things and learn what research is all about. As such mistakes are a very natural part of that progress, it's not something you should feel bad about. One of the facets of a lab participating in undergraduate research is to be pedagogical. Unfortunately, your experience will vary wildly as different labs have different perspectives on this. But the most important thing I can say is: 

If you're not enjoying research, it's likely you're not enjoying the people you're working with. 

I hated research and also felt like a failure in my research until I found a group that I fit perfectly in. Every group has different needs, and that includes needing different skillsets from you all. There's nothing wrong with not fitting in with one group, just as there's nothing wrong with not hitting it off with someone. It just wasn't a good fit. 

The first bastion of any conflict is communication. I'd talk with your graduate student about this; grad students have little to no training in being mentors, and are dealing with tremendous stress as well. They may be very supportive but unaware that they're not being supportive, or that the way they're communicating is not effective. If that doesn't work, don't hesitate to find a different group to join that will suit you better. Don't join the first group that accepts - check out a few different groups, get to know their work culture, don't just talk to the professor, try and meet the person who will actually be mentoring you (which is most often not the professor at all). 

As someone else mentioned, setting goals is a good thing to do. Why are you doing undergraduate research in the first place? What do you hope to get out of it? There's not a wrong answer here. If you want to be more competitive for graduate school, then you're going to be aiming to get your name on some publications, attend a poster session or conference, and to stay with the same group for several years to work towards a mature enough project to do those things. If you want to get a better idea of where you want to go next, then you may want to aim to be in two very different groups, definitely an internship in industry or a government lab to see the other side of what folks do. Don't hesitate to change goals later; but having some idea now is helpful. And don't hesitate to share goals with your mentor so they can help you to achieve those. I see more and more freshmen joining labs, and that's fine but unnecessarily fast, especially if you're joining before you have a good reason for doing so. Going into research late in year 2 or 3 with a good idea what you want out of it is more effective than going in too quickly. 

In general, it's normal to feel the need to compare yourself to others. But to me GT isn't best thought of as a race where you're trying to outrun as many people as you can. College is largely a journey to prepare you for the next step in your life; when you get to the metaphorical finish line you want to be ready for the next race, not gassed from this one. GT gives you the tools and resources to do that just fine; you don't have to be the fastest, and you don't have to worry about those who come in with a different set of advantages. There are plenty of opportunities on the other end for all of you that manage to finish. Run the race on your own terms, enjoy the journey, and know that you'll be in good shape for what's next. 

Finally, our old friend Imposter Syndrome. Many of your friends and classmates have it as well; you may be surprised to know many of your professors struggle with it too. Even the ones who are very accomplished. If I knew how to overcome it, I'd do that; but best I can do is live with it, and hopefully offer you some solace in knowing that many of us have it. The worst thing it does it keep you from recognizing how remarkable you really are. You have qualities, and you have gifts. I've said this to many of my students, and I've meant it sincerely. All of you have something to offer, whether its your intellect, or your perseverance, or your leadership, or your resilience. The world needs all those qualities, and gets them in different doses from each of you. It's important to find people/groups/companies that value your strengths, rather than try to shape you to be something you're not. Find those people in your research group, your advisors, and throughout life. Best of luck; if you ever want to reach out and talk more I'm happy to do that.",positive,0.9992,positive,0.20443952512134325,05/17/2023

comments,"Hey, I completely empathize. Last year, I was a freshman who came in with 5 credits (no research!). The entire year, I felt alone and isolated. I didn’t do that bad grade wise, but I did feel as if the amount I was struggling with was nothing compared to what other people were doing. I met someone who already had two years of research under his belt coming in from high school, and I really questioned whether or not I belonged at Tech. It didn’t help either that I got in off the waitlist, where it really felt just like luck that I got in. I wanted to run, and workout, and have fun with friends, but I had made a grand total of 0 real friends and only ever just gamed with my friends back home because I didn’t know what else to do. Seeing everyone have their own friend groups and achieving so much when I felt as if I was at a breaking point with 14 credit hours felt embarrassing. 

But this past year, I’ve done a lot better. I’ve met people that I care about and enjoy spending time with. I juggled the question of “do I study or live a little?” and took the latter route. I’ve been pushing myself to do better with the help of my friends, and I at least want to reassure you that it does get better. If you’re trying your best and putting yourself out there, you’ll find yourself in a better place than this first year. That’s what I did, and I found myself loving my second year so much more than my first. You’re already doing great with your research opportunity (better than me!), just keep it up, and I totally think you’ll get there. I believe in you.

If you want to talk, want any advice, or just want a friend, I’ll be there. Just let me know.",positive,0.9985,positive,0.22663510101010104,05/17/2023

comments,"First year always sucks. My experience is identical to yours, and I even used to be physically sick because of mold and dust in my dorm. I wanted to quit so hard in my first month and a half, but I somehow kept moving the goalposts up until I was done with my first year (""just one more week""). Take it slow, e-mail your professors, and get sleep. Fucking up my sleep schedule by placing my job and my courses above my own health and wellbeing was the worst thing I did. You can't function on 3-4h of sleep a day, and I learned it the hard way when I got sick for a month up to a point where my tonsils became ping pong ball sized and I could only eat yoghurt for about a week (before I actually went to an ENT and got a prescription for steroids). Just please, take care of yourself first and foremost, and reach out to your professors. Your mind can only be as healthy as your body. If you feel physically sick, definitely make an appointment with STAMPS; the mental health part should get better once everything starts working out.

As for classes, you might have signed up for too many classes (or classes that are too hard); you will find a balanced courseload as you spend more time here at Tech, but don't quit just yet. 

Your second year should be miles better. I promise.

comments,"I’d say the B1G is probably the most academically prestigious P5 conference. Seeing as we are a large research institute, are an AAU member, and have strong academics we are probably a good fit for the B1G. Our location in Atlanta expands their footprint into the Southeast which I’d assume is valuable to them. Rumor has it we had an informal invitation to the B1G during the last big round of conference realignments so I wouldn’t be surprised if we land there if the ACC is no longer.  As a fan I wouldn’t really enjoy it due to the geography of it all, but in a world where Oklahoma is in the SEC and USC is in the B1G I guess that’s just the new normal.  
  
As a fan I’d like to see us in the SEC where we’d have a chance to play old rivals and most of our away games would be relatively close. However, I’m not sure we have much to offer the SEC since they already have the state more or less locked down with uga.  
  
In any scenario I don’t see the ACC ceasing to exist. It will probably limp along after the teams with the biggest brands bolt. I’m sure they’ll bolster the ranks with some G5 schools and slowly get demoted to whatever the new second tier of college football becomes. Worst case is GT sticks around and goes down with the ship.

This creates its own host of issues, but it's nothing a little money can't fix lol.

I agree too that the SEC has no real incentive to expand to Tech! Other than adding an another academic focused school, they'll totally be stepping on uga's toes.

i also wanna point out i had a small research experience in a really good uni during high school and got a letter of recommendation from my mentor, so that also helped. 

with that out, go through the departments you’re interested in, go to research( most depts divide it by area) however if you have no idea what you’re interested in just go through the faculty list and read what they do one by one. 

create an initial list of all the people you like based on the faculty page and the lab website. then go through it again and scan through the last ~2 publications. if you’ve never read a research paper before, it’s different when you’re reading for your project vs for more info on the lab. id recommend you read the abstract and try to look up what you don’t understand, and it’s ok if you don’t understand anything. then scan through the introduction, and actually read the methods section( usually not something you do unless you’re copying a protocol the paper used), and i say this because methods section will give you some idea about the technical skills you’ll learn. use this process to again filter out some profs whose research doesn’t seem appealing anymore. it’s ok if you end up with a big list. 

now actually email them, make sure to have a professional straight forward title“ Hello Dr. X 

I hope this email finds you well, 

My name is X, i’m a Xyear studying Xmajor at Tech. I’m reaching to request the opportunity to join your lab. I’m very interested your work on X(usually labs have 2-3 research areas, it’s good to identify a specific thing if you can!) and would love the opportunity to be mentored by you. 

I have previous experience in X( if you have previous research put it here and describe what you did and the relevant skills, if not just list out anything that could help you preform better in their lab). Please find attached my resume [and if possible a recommendation letter]. 

Please let me know if any further information is needed, 
Regards, 
X” 

if the prof decides to meet, go back through the papers and sit with them, it’s a good sign if you can discuss it or identify something you’d like to work on through these papers. but generally just prepare to talk about your experiences in science and why you want to do research, long term goals etc. also just know that the imposter syndrome won’t go away when you join a cool lab, if you don’t work in it you’ll just start comparing yourself to other undergrads in the lab(not speaking from experience or anything).

create an initial list of all the people you like based on the faculty page and the lab website. then go through it again and scan through the last ~2 publications. if you’ve never read a research paper before, it’s different when you’re reading for your project vs for more info on the lab. id recommend you read the abstract and try to look up what you don’t understand, and it’s ok if you don’t understand anything. then scan through the introduction, and actually read the methods section( usually not something you do unless you’re copying a protocol the paper used), and i say this because methods section will give you some idea about the technical skills you’ll learn. use this process to again filter out some profs whose research doesn’t seem appealing anymore. it’s ok if you end up with a big list. 

now actually email them, make sure to have a professional straight forward title“ Hello Dr. X 

I hope this email finds you well, 

My name is X, i’m a Xyear studying Xmajor at Tech. I’m reaching to request the opportunity to join your lab. I’m very interested your work on X(usually labs have 2-3 research areas, it’s good to identify a specific thing if you can!) and would love the opportunity to be mentored by you. 

I have previous experience in X( if you have previous research put it here and describe what you did and the relevant skills, if not just list out anything that could help you preform better in their lab). Please find attached my resume [and if possible a recommendation letter]. 

Please let me know if any further information is needed, 
Regards, 
X” 

if the prof decides to meet, go back through the papers and sit with them, it’s a good sign if you can discuss it or identify something you’d like to work on through these papers. but generally just prepare to talk about your experiences in science and why you want to do research, long term goals etc. also just know that the imposter syndrome won’t go away when you join a cool lab, if you don’t work in it you’ll just start comparing yourself to other undergrads in the lab(not speaking from experience or anything). 

i hope this helped, feel free to ask questions!",positive,0.9987,positive,0.1968870523415978,05/18/2023

comments,">Athletics has definitely taken a back seat the last couple of decades

Maybe, but it would seem that there has been a fundamental shift around college athletics over the last couple of decades and Tech is still trying to square how to balance being MIT Monday-Friday, and Alabama on Saturday. Even then, in the past 20 years Tech sports has played in a final four, college world series, and 2 BCS/NY6 Bowl games. There are only 11 schools that have done the same. Not on that list; Alabama, Georgia, Clemson, FSU, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Oregon, Texas, & USC.

Beyond those accolades, in the past 20 years we've won multiple conference championships in baseball, basketball, football, tennis, golf, etc... And a Tennis national championship.

Not bad for being in the back seat.

The fall off of the football team is the big issue, coupled with relatively poor play from the basketball team, Tech isn't the draw it was just a few short years ago. If these discussion around conference realignment were taking place just 5 or 6 years ago, Tech would have been a much bigger draw. 

So...It's really all Geoff Collins fault.",positive,0.954,neutral,-0.030555555555555558,05/18/2023

Key is finally getting a competitive staff salary and NIL budget, something neither Johnson nor Collins got (though Johnson kinda deserved it for saying he didn’t need assistants so he could get hired and then complaining halfway through his tenure about coaching salaries). The only reason I think he’ll have a shot at being a long term coach is because there’s an easier coaching transition and he’s getting a little doubling in funding",negative,-0.7003,negative,-0.05189393939393939,05/18/2023

comments,"The first is just a rumor I’ve heard through the grapevine about him wanting to retire after ‘16, but can kind of be corroborated by the fact that he apparently wasn’t very engaged in practices in ‘17 and ‘18. What made CPJ great is that he was on his shit on game days.

Johnson didn’t need an OC to play calls, and used that as a pitch to get hired. Johnson did complain about underfunding, but more on the defensive side, so I probably made him sound more hypocritical than he really was (though he definitely spoke generally enough to infer he still wanted some funding for other coaching positions)

Problem coming off of Johnson was that not only were we running an oversimplified offense, but our offensive coaching budget was horrifically underfunded. We then proceeded to shoot ourselves in the foot even harder by hiring Geoff Collins, a head coach with a defensive background, and only giving him $400k for an offensive coordinator, when the average in the ACC was $800k. It was a losing proposition. Replace Geoff Collins with a similar coach with a defensive background and I still doubt we would’ve outperformed three 3-9 seasons",negative,-0.9671,positive,0.1328947368421053,05/18/2023

comments,"GT Athletics money comes pretty much entirely from the money they made previously. There is very little outside institute investment. I'd honestly be in favor of more institute investment since all research/history shows it's directly correlated with increased funding of academic and financial aid programs.

Alabama and Clemson offer full rides to pretty much anyone smart enough to go to a top-30 school much less attend GT. They can do this largely because they have massive alumni donations and outside money due to their incredible success in sports. 

These programs are relatively new, but give it 20-30 years and the amount of really smart people coming from those schools because of the full rides they're giving out will show. Lots of people go to Clemson for basically free and then come to GT or other top schools for grad school.

Look at Cal, UCLA, Stanford, Ivy league, UMich, Duke/UNC, etc. Amazing sports, alumni networks, and academic programs. The only elite schools with objectively bad sports are places like MIT, CMU, and LACs which receive so much outside funding due to a number of obvious factors that GT is very unlikely to benefit from. 

In addition to all these economic reasons, sports are very enjoyable for a large number of people. The stats in sports are extremely interesting and with the rise in sports betting, you can often make some money on the side if you pay attention to these stats.",positive,0.9943,positive,0.133535579004329,05/18/2023

Even as a huge fan of public transit the details are important- how far are you from the station? How far is your office from a station?

I also remember reading somewhere that Tech is rated as a top 10 program for possible fan base expansion - which is so much better than I expected, and would help Tech's push for SEC membership.

I do feel that a move to the B1G is probably more likely than getting picked up by the SEC, just because I have no idea if the bad blood between us and those Mississippi schools still exist thanks to Dodd. But even then I don't see SEC membership being a total fever dream. Hell, that article I linked said uga should follow Virginia's footsteps with VT, and try to bring Tech back into the SEC.

I also totally agree being in the SEC would help Tech tremendously when it comes to recruitment and funding! We'd definitely suck for a few years, but Georgia is just too fertile of a recruiting ground for us to do poorly for so long.

comments,"1. Fair enough, didn't take into account the fact you already graduated. Congrats, and hopefully your grad school gives you the environment you want. 

2. Trimming the fat in the GT administration makes sense. I won't disagree with you there. Too many people who don't do shit but who delay shit that needs to be done due to bureaucracy.

3. Don't call all student athletes idiots. Plenty of them are incredibly brilliant and they put a shit ton of time into being both an athlete and a student. Chris Bosh was a student athlete who learned to code at Tech, and after he was done in the NBA, he became a big proponent of programming education. These athletes can become leaders and multi-faceted people. Should our academic rigor be lowered to increase recruiting prospects? Hell no. But don't put all student-athletes in a box when you probably don't know the half of a day in their lives or what they've been through to get there.

4. As someone who grew up in Georgia and voted for Bernie in the primary and Biden in the general, I really don't get how Trump plays in here. Not to mention Georgia is a purple state now. Plenty of liberals and conservatives alike love Georgia Tech for academics and athletics. For me, wanting to come to Tech was not just a matter of top 10 CS program, but also inspired by memories of being a kid in the Atlanta area who grew up watching miraculous wins by GT's football team. I'll accept that we suck at sports now, and shouldn't be sacrificing everything academically for trying to revamp it. But the sporting traditions still hold lot of weight (JFK and Nikita Khruschev sang ""Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech' to defuse tensions during negotiations in the Cuban Missile Crisis) and shouldn't be cut or even massively defunded unless we have a really pressing need (which you haven't exercised).

5. It's completely fair to criticize overspending on sports. Some colleges overspend on football training facilities but refuse to improve their libraries (*cough* LSU). But ""we're an engineering school"" is a shitty and lazy argument that will always be shut down. Our first degree was Mechanical Engineering, and we were founded to teach technological skills needed to rebuild the South in the post-Reconstruction era. But nowhere does it say we can't also teach things other than engineering or focus on anything other than engineering for holistic development and, you know, developing better engineers and human beings. That argument completely discredits the achievements Georgia Tech students make in other fields (both academically and extracurricular-wise). Hell, does that mean we cut the College of Business, College of Sciences, College of Design (including the School of Music), and Liberal Arts College? Do we tell the bands and musicians in Home Park to fuck off and only do their CS and Engineering homework? Do we raze Ferst Center for a Robojackets facility? 

6. For what it's worth, I believe most money going into athletics comes from boosters. The academic stuff comes from USG budget as well. Could there be a way to fund athletics better without dipping into the academic or research buckets? Maybe. 

7. I stand by my statement. If anyone is claiming we should completely cut sports or athletics or be JUST an Engineering school without a logical argument other than ""dumb athlete get scholarship to throw ball"", you can transfer to India and go to a high-suicide rate IIT right away. Good luck.",positive,0.9571,positive,0.10335537918871253,05/19/2023

Granted, this is true for most universities. What made me decide to stay here for a PhD is excellent professors and some of my classmates. I've had so much support from my advisor that I wouldn't want to go anywhere else.

comments,"It would make sense that PJ would have sold himself as being a HC/OC, and that would help to re-balance the cost of the coaching staff. But I don't believe there is any evidence to support him not needing assistants, or even not caring about his assistance. PJ was vocal about paying his assistance what they deserved and the ADs, both Radakovich and Bobinski, refused to pony up the money. The same was the case with the DC. Every DC was a hire of affordability from the AD down.

Stansbury said that he was blindsided when PJ told him he was going to retire in the fall 2018. Stansbury  asked PJ to coach another season or 2, so they could set up a transition plan, but PJ said he needed a break. If PJ has suggested to Stansbury in 2016 that he wanted to retire, why would Stansbury had said he was blindsided in 2018? 

Over the last couple years of Radakovich tenure, and the entirety of Bobinski's tenure PJ became frustrated with the lack of departmental support, regardless of how hard he pushed for improvements he watch the Tech facilities and coaching support slide from above average in the ACC to virtually dead last.

comments,"You’re probably right on the first point, Radakovich was known for spending a lot of money, though I was just familiarizing myself with Tech sports at the time, so I don’t want to speculate too much here.

Stansbury and CPJ had a verbal (and technically, written) agreement to retire in 2020, which is why there weren’t contract renegotiations taking place in 2018. By the time you’re within 2 years of contract expiration, talks start to happen since recruits want to know there won’t be a major coaching change. It is possible Stansbury was blindsided by it, but in the sense that he might have only gotten a few weeks heads up, which wasn’t nearly enough of a heads up given the circumstance. My guess is Stansbury knew it was unlikely he was going to make it to the end of 2020, but that he had at least one more year.",positive,0.3976,neutral,0.024851190476190485,05/19/2023

Those sports can also not unfairly give resources to some students because they can throw a ball better than others. When's the last time that normal students have been allowed at the athlete cafeteria? Why are students paying an athletics fee when they also need to pay to watch any games? And why pay for parking if any given day the school can just decide that those spots belong to a sports event. I also several times in this thread have clarified that there are plenty of very intelligent student athletes who would've gotten into GT with no issues without the need for sports. The issue is that there are just as many who don't care about their classes and are ostensibly stealing opportunities from others who could've come to Tech.

Also, let's talk about the blatant racism towards the IITs. I know plenty of students who went there, all smarter than anyone who has ever come out of GT (including myself).

In reality I think the ACC will stand, but with schools shifting around (could totally see the sec trade vandy for clemson), but fwiw we would slot in decently in the B1G. Alot has been said about how ""were not an athletics school"", but the whole premise of GT from before admission rates dropped down crazy was that we could offer a quality education, while still having a solid athletics and traditional college experience. GT also has had a sour taste in everyone's mouth in the Collins era, since he took a pretty amazing and enjoyable football team under Paul Johnson, and absolutely drove it all into the ground. Todd Stansbury being fired also plays a huge role in how academics will be going forward since J Batt, our new AD, is coming out of a majorly successful athletic school in Alabama. I think we have a good chance of being back on the uptick rather than another mid team in sports given how things have been shaping up so far. Football had a great spring game, a new high attendance and a very solid performance from our QB/WR class which helps set a good precedence for the Key era. Basketball has been making bold transfers in, proving Stoudamire's ability to recruit. I think we won't hop out of the P5 for a minute",positive,0.9962,positive,0.1877918069584736,05/19/2023

It's a fact that GT athletics isn't self-sufficient, and that students pay an athletic fee. Are facts now anecdotes?",positive,0.347,neutral,0.0,05/19/2023
comments,More like Tech is the reason and I find it kinda delusional for a supposed “Alumni” account to say otherwise. Would you like me to donate to the university that caused me so much grief?

comments,"I’m sorry you’re so troubled. It sounds like you’re in a really bad place emotionally. It’s natural to need to place blame on something or someone for our troubles. But your anger at Tech is misplaced. This appears to be a situation that would have overwhelmed you at any large campus and possibly even a small one.  Tech is very hard; it wouldn’t be the great place it is if it wasn’t. I personally don’t know anyone who regretted going to this school. Everyone struggles in the tougher classes; everyone has bad days. But there is fantastic support all around (unlike any I’ve heard about at other schools attended by friends and acquaintances), the physical surroundings are stellar, the faculty and instruction are tops, and job placement is truly special. Although I don’t know any personally, I have heard about transfer students especially having a hard time with the rigorous academics. That’s to be expected to some degree if you’re coming over from a lesser institution.  It’s a shock for sure. Your need to place blame is normal.

comments,"Actually, you can’t. Per your own remarks, there was an external source unrelated to Tech.  Sounds like your externally sourced problems, compounded by an inability to manage the course material, resulted in some serious anger that should be properly managed for your own good.

comments,">Stanford and CMU MSCS are course based, so they take more kids and don’t care about your research as much, you just need a high GPA. I know ppl from Tech who got into Stanford MSCS with no research pubs.

The real catch with coursework only masters programs is that they're cash cows more often than not, in that they are upfront about you never getting any funding *ever*. CMU's MSCS website is very direct about this.  

Carnegie Mellon is a strong brand, but if you already have a ton of loans from undergrad, adding $100k to that total is not a smart move.",negative,-0.0611,positive,0.2016190476190476,05/19/2023
