Take the time to focus on hobbies or learn how to hang out with yourself. It's an important skill and is great for building your confidence :) And I promise you every student here has felt the same loneliness!! You will find your place and you'll find a routine, so I can't wait for what your future at GT has for you! I'm only a second year, and I often feel this loneliness especially when I spend time alone on the weekend, but I've been able to work on personal projects in the meantime, discover new interests, and just fall in love with myself!

Just make sure you follow all the requirements to a tee, and contact admissions for clarification if you're even so much as 1% confused on something! 

In the long run, I'm actually really glad that I got a pathway right out of highschool - I came from a tiny highschool in middle Georgia, and had no one else that graduated with me who also wanted to go to Tech. My mental health was poor, and my standards were unrealistic (thanks to only taking AP's in HS). After working on my mental health - I ended up meeting so many other friends at my Transfer school, who were also on pathways, and now plan to room with them next year.

It's been amazing how much better I feel starting the day with positivity rather than dreading getting out of bed. I find myself excited to take on my challenges during the day, and I didn't think that was possible for me.

comments,"Hi!

I recently got the arts and sciences pathway offer and am planning on enrolling for my sophomore year (fall 2024). I had a few questions and I'm hoping some of y'all could take some time out to answer them!

1. I'm planning on enrolling as a math major at Purdue for my freshman year (and the same when I come to GaTech, assuming I fulfil the requirements). I'm wondering how my final transcript from GaTech will look. Will my Purdue grades appear on my final transcript from GaTech? Or will it directly start from sophomore year (albeit that sounds kinda wrong I won't lie)
2. How easy is taking up a minor at GaTech? I want to take CS as a minor and I know CS 1331 is a requirement and it's really hard to enrol because of course size problems. Can I bypass the 1331 requirement by taking a course equivalent at Purdue? CS 17700 at Purdue gives me transfer credits for CS 1301 and CS 1XXX at GaTech according to [https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P\_find\_state](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_state). Will this let me bypass the 1331 requirement? Also can I even take a minor from the College of Computing if I'm in the College of Science?
3. How will co-ops work? I know GaTech generally does it between the junior and senior year for most students so do I not have to worry about it as I'm coming in during my sophomore year?
4. If there are any transfer students at GaTech reading this, do you think transferring is worth it? GaTech is my dream school and I was kinda bummed when I saw this offer but I'm really excited now as I get a chance to actually go to my dream school!!! I want to know your thoughts though

I'm sorry, this is a lot to read😭

I would really appreciate any answers or advice though, thank you so much in advance

\- Road noise. If you are a light sleeper, don't choose the rooms to the interstate side. When I was there, the nightclubs at the other side (gone now) were also a nuisance to me. Main reason that I didn't renew the lease.

\- Rooms, even with windows, are pretty dark. The windows are very small. This is not good for my mental wellbeing but just depends on whether you have issues with that.

\- Parking. Very predatory - I got booted with my rental car when I was late by like 15mins (the overnight rate is until 10am).  But maybe every place is like that so I could be wrong.

Other than that it is cheap and low maintenance.

I’m sure UCI has a very solid CS program, though it isn’t rated as highly as GT’s, and you’re bound to learn enough to get you into a good job assuming the job market isn’t fucked like it is now when you graduate. However GT has much higher “brand name” value which can do wonders to boost your resume compared to other candidates. Additionally, networking at GT is likely to get you in contact with more people who can provide opportunities for internship and FT referrals. Campus culture is also probably different and the more grind-heavy culture at tech can be a pro or a con depending on what you want, but personally the rigor and difficulty of GT courses forced me to work harder and prepared me better for what is a very competitive job market rn. Additionally being around so many friends with similar aspirations and frankly, better work ethics than mine helped push me further than a more relaxed college would have.",positive,0.9797,positive,0.16749999999999998,04/01/2023

UCLA is also very good though, so there are probably factors that matter more than recruitment. If in state, UCLA is a ton cheaper, and not having to do college in 3 years to compensate can relieve a ton of pressure.

Another factor to consider is how dead set are you on CS. If you might consider a switch to engineering, GT suddenly has a lot more value. If you might want to add on another major in say a humanities, this is not the place for that.

Also, geography. Do you want to be in California long term? If so, although GT is technically better, nobody outside of nerdy engineering circles will ever care.

I'm 100% going to be doing CS at both schools, so other majors are not in consideration / of concern. I also plan to stay in California, and most likely the Bay Area after college.

About the 3 years thing, I'm not really pressured to pursue with that plan due to cost of attendance, as my family is fortunately able to comfortably afford the OOS cost. I guess it would be nice to put my credits to use, and saving money is always nice. But it's not of highest priority, and I'm willing to pay more for a better college + post-grad experience. For reference Georgia Tech will be around 51K per year, and UCLA will be around 37K per year.

I think the main things drawing me to Georgia Tech is academics (the STEM focus, the rigor of the curriculum + threads, career fairs, larger CS department and research). And the main things drawing me to UCLA are the physical proximity to the Bay Area and the campus environment (food, housing, COA, location, etc).

comments,"51 vs 37 is a lot smaller difference than I thought it'd be. This is definitely a conversation worth having.

Seems like you have a good handle on what the major differences are. I'd say that, while the UCLA network is strong in the bay, it's not really that ""proximal"", i.e. I highly doubt you'll ever go there during college without a job offer or smth.

I'll throw 2 more considerations out there. For one, GT is definitely more rigorous. I'm finishing up 3+1 thing you're talking about (interned in the Bay and going there for full time), and have several friends doing the same. We've all had our fair share share of hell weeks and all nighters. I've seen my friends' coursework at UCLA, and there is a noticeable difference. If you want to have a traditional, partying/socializing college experience , UCLA will treat you better. But if you're a grinder who likes pushing yourself, GT will serve you well.

Second is a bit more subjective. How much do you love California? Cus growing up in state there, going to college there, and doing CS (i.e. likely going to Silicon Valley) means you'll be spending a ton of your life there. So if you love CA, that's awesome. If you want to temporarily try a different part of the country though, GT enables that.

There's a nice little GT network in the Bay too. The UCLA network is definitely bigger, but there are pros and cons to that. You're more likely to see a fellow UCLA grad, but they're pretty common, so it's not a huge talking point. If I see a fellow GT grad in the Bay, it's a real connection point. Additionally, the name just stands out a little more imo (at least in engineering circles).",positive,0.9965,positive,0.21335648148148148,04/02/2023

The problems disappeared after the first week, it was because I cleaned it myself.   


Our air conditioning stopped working during the coldest days of winter. After reporting the issue, management fixed it one week later, but it broke down again after just one day. Also, my bed is bent, and management placed a twin mattress on a twin XL frame lol.

I believe they have increased the rent from $910 to $1000. Additionally, I believe the utility fee increased from $0 to $100. So it is not as cheap as it was.  
Please also buy earphones with ANC. I live on the first floor, the road noise is always a problem. I can hear loud bass music from passing cars even during the midnight hours.

As a first-grader and an international student, I am unsure if these problems are common here. However, I would prefer to spend an additional $100 to find a better living space.

comments,"I chose GT over UCSD (I'm from San Diego) and am really glad I did. I found that I really liked the culture at GT as well as the amount of resources provided to students. GT's number of students and overall campus size is also smaller than UCSD, which is something that I found to be more fitting for me. 

Also, GT's change of major is much nicer than UCSD's. I have friends that want to switch to CS, but the UC system makes it nearly impossible for them.  GT makes it really easy to change your major either before you start or during a later semester. I changed my major from ME to CS after two years, which wouldn't have happened if I was at UCSD. 

I would say that GT is more rigorous than UCSD (I've dropped by a few of their classes with my friends during breaks just for fun lol), but both are fantastic schools.

I'd say the same main factors apply: cost, sureness that you want to do CS, desire for rigor, and geographic preference.

I guess a good question to ask yourself: how much do you want to shake up your life? In state—UCSD—cushy SWE job is a tried and true path. Assuming you like CA, you'll probably have a good time and good life.

GT has higher risk/reward. Some people absolutely do not hold up to the rigor and struggle to just get out. Some people thrive on the grind and use it to really accelerate their personal growth, landing roles out of college they didn't know exist (I was one of these).

Maybe you go become a fintech SWE in NY or a data scientist for a consulting firm (you usually need an MS for the latter). Maybe you fall in love with some niche research field and go do a PhD.

comments,"Hey. I was in your shoes as well. I think there are a couple things that helped:

1. Side projects: hackathons, your own projects, joining clubs (eg: DSGT, Big Data Big Impact, Greyhat, Bits of Good, etc) that get you exposure to building something are important. Tech is changing and in this world, showing your ability to learn new tools and APPLY them to solve a problem of your interest is important. Thats what you want your resume to convey. 

2. Find or create opportunities to improve your communication skills. I get that introvertedness has its strengths but being able to communicate and deal with other people on the team is crucial to showing that you can be a team player. Examples include TAing for a class, undergrad research, creating your own project or initiative and assembling a team, leadership positions in clubs on campus, etc. You want to convince people that you have experience working with people and you know how to deal with a difficult teammate

3. Taking your classes seriously. I know people will disagree but building good study and work habits matter. If you do everything last minute, that doesnt work long term speaking from experience. Start every assignment early so that you can maximize your learning and retention (remember long term memory is important to optimize on). When it comes to learning, focus on develooping the core understanding behind the concepts. Don't memorize the random nitty gritty. Details serve to clarify the big idea. I recommend for CS to learn a concept by doing! Go to lectures and you will be able to grow your network by making friends with your classmates and getting to know the profs. They aren't scary people!

4. Leverage your Network. It's perfectly okay to ask for people to help give you feedback on resumes, communication skills, coding skills, etc. You dont have to do everything by yourself and struggle alone. In fact, asking for help is an important skill in industry. Closed mouths dont get fed as they say.

comments,"UC Berkeley or Georgia Tech for mechanical engineering?

I was recently admitted to both schools as an international student and I'm trying to choose between the two. I understand that both have amazing ME programs but would like to know about how the program differs between both schools. For example, how much hands on work is incorporated in classes, how flexible is the curriculum, and how good are the professors. 

Here's a bit of what I'm looking for in a school:

I'm interested in competition clubs that have a lot of hands on work. I'm also interested in entrepreneurship so any programs that help with that are desirable. I like the invention studio at GT and would like to know if there's a similar facility at Berkeley. I also like the concentrations, specifically the robotics concentration, at GT and would like to know if there's something similar at Berkeley.

Location wise I think Berkeley would be nicer but I don't really mind living in Atlanta. 

I'll post this on both subreddits for different POV's.

comments,">I went to UGA my first year and then transferred. I would say it’s definitely worth it for any major, even business. Tech is overall a much better school academically, and to be honest the location of being in Atlanta is waaaaay better then Athens. In your essays, do a little research about the program you are transferring into. For example, if you’re transferring to mechanical engineering, talk about the labs and machinery available to you as a tech student, and any student programs about your incoming major you can find. Show that you have done your research on tech as a school and why you are the right fit.

I'm an upcoming UGA freshman and plan to transfer to GT for CS. Do you have any tips/advice for how I can ensure a successful freshman year and increase my chances of getting into GT?

comments,"Hi All! I am an OOS (Texas) student admitted to College of Computing. I was also admitted to UT Austin, Cornell, Rice, Purdue and several other public schools. In-state costs would be $32k per year while Cornell and GT would come between $52-$60k with travel expenses/financial aid etc. 

My questions and would appreciate whatever you can answer based on your experience: 

As a Tech student, are there significantly more industry opportunities than at UT Austin? Do most CS students take a semester for co-op or they use internships to build up experience? Do clubs, hackathons legitimately add to experience? It seems like the environment is collaborative but would be good to hear the take of current students.

This is a database of the grade distribution filterable by class and PROFESSOR. When registering for any class I always double check this to see how hard of a grader the different professors are. Use this in conjunction with RateMyProfessor.

Note: the highest grading professor ≠ the best professor. Sometimes it’s worth it to take a tough grader if it’s a class that you really want to learn a lot in. That’s something that cannot be measured and you’ll have to figure out from older folks who’ve taken those classes.",positive,0.6997,positive,0.12326388888888888,04/03/2023

comments,"Congrats! My main advice is to find someone to study with/work on homeworks with in your classes. Makes it a lot better with the hard professors. Course critique will show you which professors are hard, but you wont have options with registration being as terrible as it is. Always keep an eye out your first week for class openings with better professors in the drop/add period. Some will open up.

Also, don't buy anything from the bookstore. Get your books elsewhere like libgen or used somewhere. You won't need them immediately most likely, but if you do you can make a friend with someone who has it or just download.

My favorite food places are Velvet Taco, Hattie B's, and Jeni's in west midtown. Visit krog street market/walk the beltline for some good food too. If you're in freshman housing, grab some people from your floor and go check out town!

There's definitely something for everybody on campus, and you should go meet as many groups on campus during the welcome org fair. Rowing team will approach you aggressively. Many groups do tailgates that are fun too! Also there are free tickets you can claim for games, but you will be on the opposite side of the stadium from the main student section. 

Have fun around town but still be aware of your surroundings in atlanta. If you have to walk off campus a long way, you might want pepper spray or to limit carrying no more than what you need to. Dont walk with your phone out and avoid the BP on 10th street. The QT at 10th and northside can also suck. Oh and definitely stay away from the gas station on northside and spring. Really all gas stations I swear were where most clery acts came from. 

This is coming from a woman who was off campus walking on for many years, but theres definitely routes to take, routes to avoid, and the chance that youll have a bad encounter anyway.",positive,0.9907,positive,0.1903225806451613,04/03/2023

comments,"I’m not a professional but I did look at acceptance rates when apply for colleges as C/O 2027: a lot of universities had their acceptance rates drop (everything from
Harvard going down a few points, to GA Tech and Emory roughly halving their acceptance rate). If I had to guess on what happened, I think a blend of a growing applicant pool of students who want to go to Tech from in state and out of state. 
 
   To touch on Instate students, I haven’t seen the statistics but I would believe that group of applicants grew in size drastically as  the amount of students will Zell
Miller likely rose (covering all base tuition costs as you perhaps know). And now, yes, Zell can be hard to acquire for some applicants, but most GA Tech applications coming from in state already qualifies for Zell Miller as a part of the requirements to have a shot into going to today’s GA Tech. 

So when you account for the idea that more students are wanting to go to college, the rising appeal of GA Tech, and the “reduction” of costs for in state students with Zell Miller, a trend towards a lower acceptance rate might be possible just like with Boston College years ago.

comments,"This is an information post for summer conditional transfer students and other pathways. 

Due to the system whatever happened on the day of release, deposits were not able to be submitted and then later waived but at least for me, this caused concern about how to accept the transfer and let them know the commitment. 

As far as a call to the Department of Undergraduates went, the best answer they could give me is that you are acknowledged to be committed once you attend a FASET orientation and sign up for classes, but until then there is nothing more to do besides complete the rest of the new student checklist.

For final transcripts not being available until the week that classes start, advisors will be available at your FASET orientations and can assist you with selecting classes based on the information you give them and does not rely on a submitted final transcript. Just make sure to get it in as soon as you can and make sure it has high school courses that counted as college credits on it too.

If you haven't already, get your immunizations scheduled immediately as the doctor's office is going to be swamped and you don't want to have your move-in day happen without your immunizations completed.

On the topic of housing, at least for me, housing applications have opened and you can submit your application for summer housing. The faster you submit the application the higher on the waitlist you can be and get the chance at better rooms. With the three options available from what I've found online Woodruff is supposedly pretty bad and North Ave South/Eighth street west are the better options. Eighth street west is way northwest of campus and is pretty far away from everything. Personally, I think that North Ave South is the better option and both NAS and ESW are listed at the same cost. But the selection is a personal preference.

With all the complications that have happened, it can create a lot of worries, but the Office of Undergraduate Admissions is always available for questions, just don't wait to ask! I hope that this post helps some people that are having trouble with the process as I did, but you just have to keep at it and we'll be there in 2 months!",positive,0.9928,positive,0.15613636363636363,04/04/2023

comments,"I am a high school senior who got accepted to Georgia Tech with a CS major. I am an international student. I have several questions about Georgia Tech as it is my top choice.

1. How hard, or competitive, the study environment is?
2. How are the classes structured, is it just full of lectures and tests, or more like project-based learning?
3. How good is the career services? How well do graduates with Bachelor's degrees in CS get a job?
4. How good is the campus food + dorm life? Is it a single room or a double room?
5. How easy is it for an international student to get a scholarship during the school year after I enroll?

Among these questions, I think 3 are the most important, but any comments or opinions from you are highly appreciated. How easy it is for international student to get a job and would love to hear any information about outcomes.",positive,0.9787,positive,0.2538035714285714,04/04/2023

2. Directly to quant trading roles Or going into SWE at FAANG/Shops/other known companies and then going to quant trading.. which in your opinion is better/more doable?

thank u sm!!!",positive,0.9073,positive,0.05078125,04/04/2023

comments,"Georgia Tech vs UCLA for CS, need advice

Context: I'm in state for ucla, so it's about 39k compared to 50k for georgia tech. I'm leaning fairly heavily towards ucla, but I also think i'm biased by other people in my life, so if yall have any reasons for attending georgia tech i'd love to hear them. also curious on which would be better for my future career

UCLA (\~39k per year)

* cheaper price
* LA location
* faang recruiting boost bc cali?
* amazing education
* amazing food :)
* ap/community college credits transfer easily
* more ""overall prestige""

Georgia Tech (\~50k per year)

* slightly more expensive
* atlanta has a big tech scene
* technically higher ranking
* maybe better recruiting? (not sure)
* engineering is probably better known
* tech school mindset? not that big of a deal to me but i think i fit that more

General info:

* i can afford both schools but 40k saved is still a sizeable amount
* got into both for cs, don't need to transfer or anything
* lmk if u need other info",positive,0.9947,positive,0.2,04/04/2023

Tech was my true dream school that I realistically saw myself attending since it met a lot of the criteria I was looking for. I was so excited when I got conditional transfer and eventually got accepted, thinking this would be a new fresh start for me.

Quant finance is a field that's all about using math and computer models to make money in the financial markets. Think of it like a big puzzle - you're trying to figure out how all the pieces fit together, and use that knowledge to make smart investments and trades.

Companies like Jane Street and Citadel are the best of the best in this field - they have some of the smartest people working for them, and they're always coming up with new and innovative ways to make money. If you're obsessed with money and want to work at one of these companies, you'll need to be really good at math and computer programming. You'll also need to be able to think on your feet and make quick decisions, because the markets move fast and you'll need to stay ahead of the curve.

But if you can make it at one of these companies, the rewards can be huge. You could earn a lot of money, and you'll be working with some of the most talented people in the industry. Plus, you'll be at the cutting edge of finance, using technology and data to make money in ways that most people can't even imagine. So if you're passionate about making money and you're willing to work hard, quant finance could be the perfect career for you!",positive,0.9888,positive,0.31328709169618263,04/05/2023

comments,"For the Fall transfer application, under course requirements for CS, I put some of my AP tests in order to fulfill course requirements. However, not all of them are scores high enough to be accepted directly by GaTech. 

With that being said, the college that I am currently at took all of my AP credits and assigned course equivalencies **that are visible on my transcript**. 

Since the AP scores that I put on the application aren't high enough to fulfill those requirements, will they look at my college transcript for the ""Credits by Exam"" awarded by my college, or should I send an email to undergraduate admissions clarifying this?

comments,"I’m having trouble deciding between schools, I’m looking for a career in Biotech or Mech Engineering. 

I was recently accepted into four colleges: Stony Brook, Georgia Tech, WPI, and Clarkson University. I’m having trouble deciding between them. More info is below. 

Majors: 
Mechanical Engineering at Stony Brook. 
Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Tech. 
Double majoring in Mechanical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering at WPI. 
Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering at Clarkson.

Cost: 
Clarkson and Stonybrook would be about the same cost, WPI and Georgia Tech would be about the same cost, With WPI/Georgia Tech being about 15-20k more than Clarkson or Stony Brook. Realistically, finance is not a major concern, but definitely not something to be disregarded. 

Other information: 
I am in the honors college at Stony Brook. I currently live in Buffalo NY, so I am used to colder weather/snow. 

What are the Pros and Cons of Georgia Tech?

Thank you in advance for your time and effort spent answering my questions.",positive,0.7717,neutral,0.030722402597402592,04/05/2023

comments,"Hey GT subreddit, I'm a sophomore student at KSU and applied to LMC at GT for Fall 2023. I have a 3.8 overall GPA and 3.5 math and natural science GPA, the minimum requirement for both is a 3.3 to qualify for the APS (atlanta public school) pathway. I have all the class requirements for transfer. I'm really nervous about admission and have a feeling something will go wrong and I won't get in. I have no idea if this pathway is guaranteed admission, as they refuse to use the word on the website and I've never heard of anyone transferring through APS. It's a fairly new pathway which is probably the reason for the lack of info online. If anyone has gotten in on APS, I would love to hear about it. Also I didn't get an email offer for this pathway, you just have to have a 3.3+, apply from an atlanta public school, and meet all transfer requirements. I assume they will consider you for the pathway through the usual transfer application? I'm not sure.",positive,0.1806,neutral,-0.00636363636363636,04/05/2023

comments,"ngl, i spend the first few days of ramadan feeling really sad and disconnected from my spirituality. it's really difficult to pull myself out of that mentality- i'm not even sure why it happens. so ur definitely not alone in this- Allah puts us through difficult emotions at times to learn more about ourselves and the nature of this dunya. comparing your experience or even yourself to others - especially when it comes to spirituality, ramadan, islam, or even genuine joy in this holy month- is the fastest way to kill any seed that may be beginning to sprout. 

&#x200B;

i know it's hard. it doesn't have to be like this, inshAllah. if you need someone to talk to, or pray next to, or listen to Quran with, or literally just break your fast with- i can be that person inshAllah. there's a lot of people at tech who want to genuinely give love and community to whoever comes searching. that is the nature of islam, after all. 

&#x200B;

alhamdulillah. biggest piece of advice i can give you is to say your shukr, cry, break down, and have tawakkul in Allah. it's all normal, but the only way out is through. inshAllah, whenever you need there's a community of warmth and acceptance waiting for you at tech. may Allah make this easier on you.

comments,"you’re definitely not alone dude. first thing, comparing how you feel spiritually atm with everyone else (from the outside) probably isn’t the move. personally, with all the events I attend and how busy I am during ramadan, it could easily look like im always feeling the ramadan vibes and benefiting spiritually, but tbh sometimes I feel like im just going through the motions instead of really connecting. everyone’s struggling with something, so please don’t feel alone in that sense. 

if you’re finding it a bit difficult to invest your energy in a lot of ramadany things, maybe start with one thing and try being consistent w/ that. like if you’re finding it hard to sleep, use some of that quiet time to just talk to Allah regularly.

again, try not to compare your ramadan experience with others. it isn’t meant to be a 30-day spiritual high, the goal is to grow over the course of the month, and it def seems like you’re doing that by reaching out. also just pu to the msa events :) they’re vibey",positive,0.9518,positive,0.06480392156862745,04/05/2023

All right? The originals were simple.

They were just thousands
of AAA mortgages bundled together,

guaranteed by the U.S. government.

The modern ones are different.

They're private. And they're
made up of layers of tranches.

The highest level, AAA,
is getting paid first.

The lowest rated, B, is getting paid last,
taking on defaults first.

Now, obviously, if you're buying B's,
you could make more money.

But they're a little risky.

Sometimes they fail.

Chris?

Somewhere along the line,
these B's and BB's

went from a little risky

to dog shit. Where's the trash?

I'm talking rock-bottom FICO scores.

comments,"ive been having a VERY hard time deciding between CS programs. Right now my options are either ut dallas for 18k or georgia tech for 50k 💀. i know that utd sounds like the most obvious option in terms of short term cost, but im thinking that georgia tech would be more worth it in the long run (?). georgia tech isnt tooooo much of an issue to pay for, but its still a bit of a stretch.... additionally i feel that the prestige of georgia techs program really represents my high school work, which i'm not sure applies as much to utd. can anyone help or give me guidance? i dont know much about utd's program, so i want to know how it compares...

ps: i am currently admitted as a ds student at utd, but i plan on switching and then possibly getting a masters later. does the cost of georgia tech enable a master's degree soon after (i want to specialize in data science post-grad) please help ‼",positive,0.9327,positive,0.10979691876750698,04/06/2023
comments,">Why would they also wait to roll this change out right before registration???

The new interface has actually been rolled out for a year now. They've been piloting this since last March and there were even workshops that taught you how to use it. The most recent change was that you can no longer access the old interface. At the very least, you can't say they didn't warn everyone that this was coming. FWIW, there appear to be instructional videos on [this](https://registrar.gatech.edu/registration/registration-assistance#registering-for-a-basic-course) page, which was linked in an email sent on March 19th.

As for who's responsible, your complaints lie with the [Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia](https://www.usg.edu/regents/members) and with [Ellucian Company L.P.](https://www.ellucian.com/) The latter wrote the software and the former is why we have to use it.",negative,-0.4299,positive,0.07564344746162929,04/06/2023

I was wondering if people could fill me in  on the culture of the program (are students, staff, and faculty usually  friendly, cooperative, warm?) Also how supportive is the program for its  students? I know sometimes life things can come in the way so if anyone  can lmk how they felt the school and the program was able to support  them? Also how is the diversity and inclusion efforts? And if there are  any things that they wish they could change or improve about the  program?

Also psychiatry here is okay, but there is no long-term therapy.

comments,"I'm in developer education and am happy to talk about it including doing 1:1 calls if any GT students are seriously interested, but if you are graduating soon it's a tough time in the industry in general and thus I suspect not an easy time to break into developer education because as a specialty field there's a smaller number of roles, and people frequently switch into developer education mid career.

 If you are considering this direction right now the reality is that you may need to work in CS or sales engineering, or as a standard SWE first - because every company needs a number of those right away. This is not as bad as it sounds because all of those will give you desirable skills for the role.

The main way to increase your chances of breaking in is to start coding in public, a lot, and start teaching. Social media, streams, giving talks, blog posts.

However, you don't need a program at all to break into the industry, those are really mostly if you want to work in BigTech, there are places that hire juniors without programs.

What I suggested for developer education - coding in public - will generally offset any GPA challenges for most roles. It's a very valuable skill to cultivate for you personally because you build a network that will help you find roles. Companies also find it valuable even outside of developer education because while you land initial developer roles by coding, at higher levels your people skills become as important as your coding skills.",positive,0.902,positive,0.16926406926406926,04/07/2023

i’m an admitted student for fall 2023 for pure cs at uiuc and gatech. i’m interested in machine learning/quant/trading and i was wondering how the opportunities compare. if anyone has insight on differences in course difficulties that would be very much appreciated too! 

important note!!!! i will be graduating debt free either way so cost doesn’t matter too much. also i am a woman in cs but it doesn’t seem like there’s a huge difference in terms of support for women in cs

here’s a pro con list i have so far:
georgia tech
pro:
* t5 for cs
* $50k a year
* easy commute (2 hour flight and 20 minute car ride from airport)
* in atlanta (big city)
* lots of research opps 
* recruiting is easy 
* ok campus, prettier than uiuc
* lots of major flexibility

con:
* housing in atlanta is expensive
* no good nearby boba
* registration might be rough bc no cap on cs transfers
* dorms are hit or miss too
* food is bad
* hot and humid (will need to get straightening perm)
* dangerous off campus
* super engineering focused and i don’t want to be only surrounded by engineering stuff all the time
* i like gold but the gold just looks like mustard yellow on merch

uiuc
pro:
* t5 for cs
* easy course registration, should be able to get all the cs classes i need and want w ease
* not hot or humid 
* lots of yummy food and boba options around
* super safe on and off campus
* cheap off campus housing
* single use bathrooms in dorms 😝😝
* average starting salary is higher at uiuc
* research park has super easy interviews for uiuc students so i can do internships for up to $30/hour while taking classes
* emphasis on interdisciplinary stuff

con:
* 60k a year (10k more than tech)
* annoying commute (2 hour flight and then 2.5 hour bus ride to campus)
* bad location
* tornadoes and blizzards
* kinda ugly campus
* dorms are hit or miss
* not much flexibility with changing major (cannot transfer back into cs if i transfer out)
* orange 😟😟😟",positive,0.9959,positive,0.08909153600464578,04/07/2023

I did not even feel brave enough to request accomodations from my professors or even talk about fasting with my friends, because so many of them were openly discriminatory to me (this was around the time of 9/11)... Glad to see times have changed and people are supportive in the comments. This diversity and change of times are beautiful to see at Tech. My best advice is to stick in there and be proud of yourself, and never try to change your identity just to fit with a majority. Just know that you are not alone and you have many people rooting for you, my prayers are with you <3",positive,0.9911,positive,0.326875,04/07/2023

I am offering my one bedroom and bathroom (shower included) in a 2b/2b apartment. It comes fully furnished, and with WiFi. The apartment itself comes with a kitchen, living room, and laundry room. The monthly rent for one bedroom/bathroom is around $1100 (negotiable).

The apartment is located on 1041 State Street NW, Atlanta, GA 30318. If you are a student then  you will be happy to know is really close to campus, only 5 minutes walk from the apartment to campus itself, and 10 minutes to the college of computing. It is also 10 minutes walk away from the Georgiat Tech Police office.

In terms of shops and convenience stores, there are Publix and Target(with a CVS pharmacy) stores as well as many nearby restaurants within a 15 minute walk radius.

I'm an international student and a hijabi and it seems like a rite of passage to experience racism. a lot of ppl in my social circle don't know it's Ramadan and I don't talk about it bc I'm just scared of the reaction. were halfway thru the month and the only ppl who know are ppl who straight up ask me about it (ie they're already familiar with it). I'm a freshman and I've already experienced everything from microaggressions to outright racism and that's crazy to me.

I guess since my grades were good and I wasn’t drinking or doing drugs the person screening me decided all I needed was this weekly group meditation class. I did go to several meetings but dropped it because it didn’t really help with my depression/anxiety. It just felt like something they held so they could say look, we DO provide resources! I tried to advocate for myself and ask them to p l e a s e help me get psych services on or closer to campus but they said they reserve those resources for crises or for students coming from far away. The usual “you’re not sick enough, maybe try again when you are”.

I thought maybe this had changed in couple years that have passed but judging by the comments they are still unable or unwilling to provide preventive, comprehensive, and sustainable mental health care and resources for GT students. I see that they provide some free therapy sessions but imo it can be really difficult to start therapy and have to switch therapists (after the free sessions expire) so I would be cautious with doing that. 

Good luck, OP. I’m sorry I don’t have many answers for you but it does get better.",positive,0.9913,positive,0.1115424430641822,04/08/2023

Since GT doesn't guarantee housing for freshman, I'm concerned that it will be too late. Should I be worried, and do I need to commit ASAP in order to get housing? I don't want to fully commit until I've visited (which is on April 15).",positive,0.7245,negative,-0.15,04/08/2023

I was recently accepted into both Tandon at NYU and Georgia Tech. I'm struggling to decide which I would prefer to attend, and I was wondering if you have any insight. I want to pursue a minor in Aerospace engineering, with mechanical my backup choice at Tandon

NYU Tandon

Pros: NYC, I feel that its more adventurous, can pursue a minor, easier to escape if I don't want to do engineering, northern climate

Cons: Mechanical, not aerospace, ranked lower for engineering, no campus feek, required to live on Brooklyn campus first year

GATech

Pros:Campus, one of the best at Aerospace, more prestigious engineering school

Cons: Less socially diverse, lacking options for minors, more work

Thanks",positive,0.921,positive,0.2579254079254079,04/08/2023

At worst, if that doesn't occur, you can still show up on graduation day dressed and ready to go. They allow walk-ins as long as they have the room for it (and ever since they moved graduation to Bobby dodd, the staffers told me theres like a 99% chance there will be extra room), they'll let you in and walk.

Although, this might be self selection to a certain extent. Because I actually know a lot of ppl from GT who got interviews for trading roles from top firms, but basically nobody passes. 

GT is a target school for SWE roles at quant firms though. We send a bunch of SWEs to Two Sigma, Optiver, and Citadel every year. And a few to Jane Street/HRT.

If you’re interested in trading, you could intern at a quant firm as a SWE and then internal transfer to a trading role for full time. For example, I know a guy from GT who interned as a SWE at Jane Street the summer of his junior year, and got a return offer for full time, and then internally transferred to a trading role.

The reason why they typically give slaps on the wrist is because it is usually the easiest way to deal with such infractions if:

\- no one has gotten hurt

\- no property has been damaged

\- the student is unlikely to re-offend

However, I would advise caution with catching an administrative official (i.e. a bureaucrat) on a bad day or testing their patience.   The only impetus to treat you kindly is that it makes their job easier and requires less paperwork and follow up.    The \*minute\* that fails to be the case they might opt to make things more difficult for you.    If you don't have family with deep pockets who make donations or other connections that you could bring to bear then I would tread very carefully.

I had a very good gpa, but I never really care about it, I worked on project and that's what got me my job.
Also, make sure to make friends at school, do no underestimate their help after graduation.
FAANG are cool but they are not the only company that pays well and have cool project. They are hard to get into and most likely your job there won't have any big impact ( speaking from experience ).
If you still want a big company, look through all the companies listed on both the Nasdaq and the SP500, I promise you they all need CS grads.
I can talk for hours about it but bottom line GPA really don't matter, HR will look at your transcript to mKe sure you are enrolled or have graduated but nobody will care about your gpa after school ( also speaking from experience ).
Leetcode is cool BUT projects are better, I have interviewed many students who could leetcode, but they lack creativity in solving a real problem.
Leetcode get you only through the interview, it doesn't really help you develop skills to actually solve an issue on a big project.
Anyway, you should make good connection in college, work on projects ( don't even try to reinvent the wheel ) and yeah leetcode as well.

I am currently deciding between UMich and Georgia Tech and I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me out?

I visited Georgia tech campus and I loved it. I’m more keen on it than UMich, plus it has more pros in my opinion.

Pros: I got a nice scholarship plus another outside scholarship that will stack to make me pay less than 10k a year for tuition (I know there’s other fees like room and board but this is rlly good I think)

Cons: I know GA Tech is a big engineering school. I plan to major in Physics and Mathematics w/o any intent in engineering per se

Tbh I haven’t done a lot of UMich research but it would cost a lot more, only pro may be the environment and/or better resources for my major. 

Anyways, if anyone could help me out, or “sell” me on GA Tech, I would be beyond grateful!",positive,0.9726,positive,0.27180989583333337,04/09/2023

You start with a customer and manufacturing based design approach and then work your way through design stages with the path forward based on results from testing. Although while I was taking it, I did not view the lecture as valuable. I thought the most important part was winning the competition with a good design. Looking back on it as a senior, I can see the most important part were the lectures and working on a team with other engineers to create results driven solutions. The hours were long, sure, but you got to share the time with other engineers with (hopefully) the same passion for engineering that you have. I'd say it was a great experience for me even though everything fell apart during the competition.",positive,0.9727,positive,0.32202380952380955,04/09/2023

 >A cascarón (plural cascarones, without accent mark; from Spanish cascarón, ""eggshell"", the augmentative form of cáscara, ""shell"") is a hollowed-out chicken egg filled with confetti or small toys. Cascarones are common throughout Mexico and are similar to the Easter eggs popular in many other countries. They are mostly used in Mexico during Carnival, but in American and Mexican border towns, the cultures combined to make them a popular Easter tradition. Decorated, confetti-filled cascarones may be thrown or crushed over the recipient's head to shower them with confetti.

Thank you all for the comments, makes me feel better about the situation. Anyways here is the update.

The individuals were identified and its confirmed that they aren't enrolled at Tech, nor are they from in-state. They traveled to Atlanta from out of state for some convention and had time before their return trip so that was when they decided to come to campus to do the pranks. Its also confirmed that they also went to other classrooms to do the same thing, which confirms the other cases some of y'all mentioned in the comments. Charges are being pursued with the intention to warn them to not do this again.

Kinda do feel bad about them being pressed charges, but with there being five of them plus the teacher making it clear to stop, and they also did it in other lectures, from a perspective I think it is deserved. Still, makes part of me hope the charges are not as severe and that really in the end they just learn their lesson and not do it again. Especially during this time with all the violence and political drama, this sort of prank is just not worth doing since it has the potential to do damage. I understand that theres a time for being funny, and that this sort of thing might have be more acceptable and maybe funny in a different time period, but the timing was not good at all, and that they should have thought about it twice instead of making the situation into a headache for all of us.",neutral,-0.0286,positive,0.053947368421052654,04/10/2023

But they had a separate additional system like GT-scheduler that was developed by university and integrated with registration that allowed you to bypass Ellucian. I think it was something like Registration Wizard or Class Wizard. It looked modern and had a good UX. 

Registration events typically lasted for months bc they didn't have 2 stages of registration. Somehow, this didn't prevent people from getting into classes: on contrary, it was never an issue at all.

I think this registration shit is the one thing Tech has managed somewhat okay by moving Everyone back two days, which isn't perfect but better than them ignoring the issue like they have in the past. 

Source: I've had 2 siblings go to UGA starting 2017 and continuing now. Sis never had any issues with registration, and when they had a blanket policy to move everyone out of certain dorms to make space for freshmen, she was able to contact Housing and get an exception to the dorm she was currently at.

I work for a top tech company and manage services with 99.99% uptime.  That’s 52 minutes a year we are contractually allowed to be unavailable.  Some services are even 99.999% available, with only 310 seconds per year of downtime.  A few minutes of downtime during a traffic spike can be multiple millions of lost revenue, so it makes sense.

How do we do it?  We hire good people and follow best practices, that’s it.  The fact that OIT has taken over 6 hours to resolve the SSO issue is a big indicator for OIT

1. Not having enough people
2. Having the wrong people
3. Not following best practices (see 2)

comments,"Yes, but the buses are actually reliable to get from place to place. No sitting around for 30 minutes to see if maybe the bus will show up. At least their buses consistently have their tracking on and set to the correct route so you can know what is going on. 

They made an exception because her dorm was mostly graduating seniors, and they were going to designate it for the next round of freshmen. It's a complex situation, and Housing realized that a blanket policy doesn't work for those things and adjusted. She was a junior and about to get screwed out of the room she'd been in for 3 years because of a change in dorm designation. The freshmen still had places to go, but there's no reason for her to have to move across campus when she selected that dorm specifically because it was close to her classes. I think that's a reasonable exception to make, since the next year she was leaving anyway so freshmen could get that spot. Why do freshmen need that specific room so bad? What's wrong with letting an upperclassman who's been at the school for years keep their room? It's not reducing the number of freshmen that can live on campus, they're just not screwing her out of a room when she was able to stay same for years before that. 

Tech kicked everyone out of Eighth Street S/E last year for honors kids, so I know how shitty it feels for Housing to screw you out of the dorm you picked specifically and then not communicate on if you even get to at the very least register early to get a comparable dorm. At least UGA is willing to work with their students at all. In fact, I think it's a hugely positive thing for individual students to be able to advocate for themselves and be heard.",negative,-0.9488,neutral,-0.001146245059288528,04/10/2023

One of my classes only has 16 seats (which even for summer seems absurd for a required class in the ME department).

The college of computing hosts a research fair at the begining of every semester where profs who are looking for undergrad research assistants come and talk about their research.

There's a big CS career fair at the beginning of every semester, although UIUC probably has this too.

Dear Georgia Tech Students and Employees:

The Office of Information Technology  is working to resolve a Georgia Tech Single Sign-On (SSO) outage that  has impacted connections to campus services and sites, including, but  not limited to, Banner, Canvas, OneUSG, Oscar, and Workday.

Because of this outage, registration has been moved back by one week. Students can retrieve their new registration schedule at [registrar.gatech.edu/info/time-ticket-distribution-schedule](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/time-ticket-distribution-schedule).

We will provide an update regarding this issue as soon as possible. In the meantime, please visit [status.gatech.edu](https://status.gatech.edu/) for updates.

Thank you for your patience as we work to restore services.

Like, I've never met a cat that would be cool with getting boxed up, taken to an unfamiliar public place, and getting pet by random people. The best case scenario is that cats scratch the shit out of everyone and run away to join the feral cat colony.

comments,"Sounded pretty reasonable until the part where they want you to convince a club to test out your recruitment solution and collect feedback. One week is way too short of a time frame for that. My student org spends 3-4 weeks per semester on recruitment and I know many that spend much longer. I proposed a new recruitment plan to my org last semester and it took weeks of planning on my part before I pitched it, and even then my org decided against trying it out. I was a VP at the time, so I’m not sure how you’re expected to make this work as someone who isn’t even a member of the club. 

Not to mention, it’s the end of the semester. Most orgs really focus on recruitment at the start of the semester, so even if they are working on recruitment now it’s in preparation for the upcoming fall, not the two weeks we have left. 

If someone reached out to me to interview about my org’s recruitment process to identify problems and propose solutions, I would be more than happy to make time for that and that would be a perfectly decent GT 2000 assignment. Asking orgs to implement that, especially this late in the semester, is a bit impossible.

Unfortunately, the P=nP problem that is course scheduling is just universally and intractably difficult. students experience it through an individualized lens - rightly so. The flipside is the university has to work with an enormous number of constraints and inherent difficulties that are likely to make *at minimum* a certain percentage of students unhappy with the result.

This is a story old as time with institutions and their PR. They only care about how they look and part of it is having a rhetoric about how much do they care about all things and their people (we are family), but at the end they can be cutthroat. 

In academic institutions they are also a success black hole. All the success of alumni and faculty is used to promote it more, but the externalities don't belong to the image of the institution. Things like burn down students, alumni that don't make it, grad students living on a very low salary for many years don't make it to the .edu front-page. Success always goes in in praise and $$$, anything else does not belong to the university.

If you make it be prepared to be begged for money, if you don't they will not help you because they are not a charity, they are a school with a research institute on the side you commie.

If they could care about anything else that is not PR they would plan better to be able to house every student at top quality at low cost, but I beg the priority is still ticketing all these parking offenders.

comments,"I was admitted for this summer under the conditional transfer pathway. I've been trying to keep an eye out for when FASET orientation registration opens so that I can register for classes as soon as possible and was under the impression I would receive an email when it did. Today, however, I checked the admission portal and saw that a new link for FASET orientation was available. The only option listed was for May 11th, which is only a few days before the semester starts. I'm not sure whether this is because all the other dates are filled up or if more will be available later. Just in case, though, I signed up for it. Attending orientation and registering for classes this late brings up two main issues for me:

1) I'm a CS major, and I was planning on taking the following courses: CS 1301, CS 2050, and ISYE 3770. I know CS classes tend to fill up very quickly, so I'm worried I won't be able to get into the classes I need.

2) I currently live about 40 minutes away from the GT campus and have been considering moving closer. This decision, however, depends on my schedule. If I can compact it enough so that I only have classes 2 days a week, I wouldn't bother moving. Otherwise, I would want to move closer. With such a late registration, I won't have much time to move if I'm able to compact my schedule, and I wouldn't want to move before knowing for sure what my schedule is.

Does anyone know if any more FASET orientation dates will be available or if there's any way I can register for summer classes sooner as a new transfer student?

Casually bragging about enrolling more undergraduates than ever when just last Fall, and this Spring, have had no where near enough housing for all the current students. Great move.

comments,"The majority of universities do not have housing for 100% of students and the housing situation here is similar to/better than a **lot** of other places. Almost everywhere prioritizes housing for underclassmen and don't guarantee it to anybody else.

As for enrollment vs housing capacity, around 47% of undergrads live on campus, per the CDS. Be happy we aren't at UGA (34%), GSU (18%), Kennesaw State (13.6%), the other GSU (23%), Clemson (33%), FSU (19.8%), UT Knoxville (27%), UC Berkeley (27%), UNC (44%), U of MN (23%) ....I think you get the picture. I can get the numbers for a dozen other places if you don't.

If you have a really cool idea for a product and don’t mind putting in the extra work to make it happen, do Create-X. Otherwise if you’re just trying to be done, definitely don’t do Create-X.

Personally, my group’s ME Capstone advisor is Prof. Tinskey, and he’s been a very good advisor for us—as long as we’re clearly making progress and document our product design process and update him, he has not been strict regarding deadlines or having a dozen submissions through the semester with very specific formatting and content guidelines.

If you're looking at six figure debt for MIT vs little to none here, it's not worth it.

Also, the average CS grad here earns north of 100k. I don't know where you got the 87k figure from. If you're chasing FAANG, that's very attainable from here. The salary may be a little lower than MIT because they are more likely to stay in the northeast, which has higher salaries in general. I really don't think the ""lifetime earnings"" argument that they are pushing in /r/mit is very sound given you want to get into FAANG. FAANG grads from here make the same as FAANG grads from there.

comments,"I think you should consider MIT at least a bit more strongly than other commenters here suggest. As others have said both schools have great career opportunities and open up many of the same doors. IMO there are still plenty of doors that GT won't easily open compared to MIT - I would guess the *mean* first year compensation at MIT is substantially higher than GT's to the point where the debt could be worth it. But more broadly, I think there are many ""soft"" pros to attending to MIT. If you are making 150k+ straight out of school your experience with student loan debt will be extremely different from the average college student and you likely won't ever feel significant financial stress from it. I think beyond plain ROI it's still important to be a bit selfish and think about where you'd enjoy attending school more.

That's not to say the right answer is MIT (hope it didn't come off that way!), you should talk to students and try to get a feel for things like culture/classes/campus at each school and think about what's important to you",positive,0.6955,positive,0.17420634920634923,04/13/2023

comments,"Go to MIT and don’t look back. 

I understand your fixation on the cost difference and applaud you for being financially responsible. But in this case, there’s tangible value to the debt. 

There’s also an element of uncertainty that has to be acknowledged, and nobody seems to be acknowledging it — there will be multiple mid-degree opportunities for additional scholarships/funding, and likely **far** more of those at MIT than at Tech. GT is strapped for cash as a public institution, and you’ll see that in a lot of ways, big and small — for example, at MIT, even undergraduate research pays minimum 15/hr, and even freshmen get easy access to paid research via the UROP program. At GT, most professors won’t want to pay you, even as an upperclassman: you’d need a PURA, which caps out at $1500 for a semester. At MIT there are more scholarships for fully funded exchange / study abroad programs; at GT, count yourself lucky if the OIE office gives you $2k to offset your flight. Etc etc. 

Ultimately, my point is that the cost difference between the two schools upon enrollment is absolutely not guaranteed to be the same cost difference between them upon graduation, and it’s tiring to see these comparisons be made over and over with that false underlying assumption. The potential for landing additional, mid-degree funding up there is astronomically higher.

Your employability and general safety net in life will also be higher as an MIT graduate — the MIT brand is strong anywhere in the world, in any field, and the same cannot be said for Tech. What happens if you branch out of CS? If you have any humanities-related interests you’d want to explore by dual enrolling at Harvard? Not everything in life is about the tech industry. 

But even then, for certain opportunities (think early-stage startups), being an MIT graduate can be enough to land you an interview, while GT may not have the same effect. Which also introduces a scary possibility: if you underperform academically at Tech (a real possibility no matter how talented you are) you’ve missed out on the employability “protection” that the MIT brand name would’ve given you. Yes, many of GT’s top CS grads start out at FAANG, but I would not be surprised if there were far more **low GPA** GT grads struggling to find a job than low GPA MIT grads in the same situation. The overwhelming majority of people I met at Tech who graduate with low GPAs tank their grades in the first half of their degree; at MIT, you’ll get pass/fail protection at the beginning to focus on the adjustment. 

I insist that you go to MIT and make it work. Prioritize paid research opportunities, get a high-paying internship your first summer if you need to. The average GT grad is far from guaranteed to be able to go to MIT for grad school, and MIT offers you a lifelong career boost, so the smart thing to do is to see this as a one-time deal, take it, and make it work.",positive,0.9949,positive,0.13493683187560734,04/14/2023

They all do research in one flavor of AI or another and they span a number of different departments here. There is no shortage of AI people at Georgia Tech.

comments,"Hey all, I'm grateful to have been offered admission here, in addition to Duke and NC State. I'm trying to work through and decide. 

* Intended major: Civil engineering (possibly industrial, but likely civil)
* Costs (no aid at any school)
   * Duke: \~$80k/yr
   * NC State: \~$30k/yr (in-state)
   * GaTech: \~$50k/yr (oos)

Again I'm grateful to be admitted to each and looking for advice. Open to minors and possibly second majors (depending on school) in other areas, particularly economics, public policy, business, polysci.

Other note: obviously plans can change, but I would also likely go to graduate school for an MCE and an MBA.

I'm looking for a lot of flexibility with my degree (to pursue multiple types of jobs), in addition to cost-efficiency. Facilities, clubs etc. aren't a huge deal breaker or winner to me. Any advice would be appreciated.",positive,0.9578,neutral,0.04136904761904763,04/14/2023

Tech companies and trading firms just do TSA patdown-level screenings before offering you internships. 

At gatech during undergrad, I was successful in my goals, but I was always a number fighting for relative scraps. At MIT as a grad student, I finally felt like I found my people who were truly interested in the niche academic and radical ideas I always wanted to discuss in detail. Of course GT has excellent undergrads who are full of drive and ambition, but I found a higher concentration of these types at MIT as a urop mentor. Obviously this wasn’t a controlled experiment, but the differences in environment are obvious and you’re always going to doubt your choice if you don’t choose the best engineering school in the world (according to popular perception).",positive,0.9817,positive,0.30546874999999996,04/14/2023

comments,"You have brought up a great point about talking to the students. While I live in Georgia and am close with multiple people who currently attend Georgia Tech, I have also visited the MIT campus and struck up a friendship with a few undergrads who currently attend the institution. While I was unable to view any of the lectures, I generally liked the experience I had interacting with students on the MIT campus more; however, my experience with 10-15ish people on a sunny day in Boston is likely not representative of the approx. 4k students of the undergraduate class, furthermore, the trip I took to GT was on a more rainy day so I interacted with fewer people on the tour my friend provided for me. 

Now on the topic of mean first-year compensation, it has been hard for me to quantify considering the varying costs of living associated with the locations the schools reside in. Based on the metrics provided by [www.collegesimply.com](https://www.collegesimply.com) I am seeing about 85k starting from GT and about 118k starting from MIT. But this is not taking into account the fact that MIT students typically acquire jobs in the north which have a higher cost of living than in the south which would greatly impact the net ""starting salary"".

If I wanted the traditional college experience I would not even consider MIT but GT will always be a fierce competitor in this decision
