comments,"Bit vague on detail and what you wanna accomplish here, but here's my take:

Ask the TAs for help if there is a chance of a C or B at all and you think there is a way for you to get there. There are also peer tutors and others who can help you. The best thing you can do is attend all the office hours you can; literally, some of the office hours before classes can be ghost towns unless its the day of the exam or the hw. Go earlier than the rest of the crowd, like a week earlier, for help. Heck, just hang out there and do HW, if you don't have any particular questions. Just being there can allow the TAs to give you encouragement and help.

If you think you can't get a B or a C, and you want advice if you should drop the course with a W, the TAs can't legally help you (or at least should refer you). Instead go to the professor for his advice and to your academic adviser for help on what to do while still graduating on time.

If you feel you are too stressed about the class, relax. You got the rest of your life ahead of you, you're not going to base your life on one class. If you feel your mental health fundamentally deteriorating, don't hesitate to ask for health from professionals.",positive,0.9899,neutral,-0.03333333333333334,11/30/2018

With a background like Carter's, there are a few statistical near-certainties:  you will be comfortable financially, you will eventually get a career you find satisfying unless you sell out or go to law school, and if you think statistically and algorithmically you will eventually find a girl/man you are crazy about.

If the stress is getting to you, do something about it.  Maybe you need to pull out for a while to gain perspective.  Maybe you need to stop being so hard on yourself.  Think about the Laffer curve.  You get diminishing returns when you tax yourself too much.

In the end, you will have a degree from a great school.  The quality of the degree is equal to the amount of work you put in.  Employers will want you.  Grad schools will want you.

comments,"Asian as well, my mom also didn’t like the idea of working and extending my graduation.

To be honest I kinda understand the point, you need to balance the benefits of getting work experience, not excessively delaying your graduation, and still enjoying your time on campus.

For me that meant only working in the summers. Two internships for me ended up being enough to find a good job after graduating. I also TA quite a few semesters, but don’t know if that had any impact.

I turned down a decent internship offer once because they asked me to work July-December and were not flexible on their dates. That would’ve prevented me from doing classes two semesters in a row. I didn’t feel that the cost of delaying for 2 more semesters was worth the experience. I just made sure to get an internship that summer instead.

Overall I found that co-op people do lose out a bit on campus life since they’re constantly in and out throughout their college careers. If you have decent friends it’s not too bad, but there definitely is an impact.

IMO summer internships, if you can get them, are the best of both worlds. You get decent experience, you don’t miss much on campus bc it’s summer, and you extend graduation (I guess you could take summer classes to graduate early but meh)


As for housing, it varies. Some internships/co-ops offer designated apartments that they keep for temp employees. Some offer extended stay hotels. Some provide a stipend. And some provide nothing at all. ",positive,0.9801,positive,0.18042929292929294,12/01/2018

Lecture is very theory based, and there's a project where you need to make a 4-5 DoF robot and write a paper about it.

However, I do think there are measures that can be taken to help students learn to cope with the stresses of school and life. Specifically, no one should **ever** be turned away from or put on a waitlist for campus counseling services. As far as I know, they prioritize more severe cases before ""less severe"" ones. This system basically waits for students to get worse before actually helping (as far as I know). Doesn't seem like the most effective way to increase coping mechanisms. Also, I think we should try to change the culture around mental health here. Tech is hard, we all know that. But the administration doesn't need to continue to play this up so hard.

And I'm also not so sure if this is much as much a zero-sum game as u/CAndrewK implied. If professors were to lighten their workload, would GT automatically become less prestigious? GT can still be prestigious and give students more time for unwinding and living life.

comments,"Idk, this may not be taken very well here, but it kind of gets on my nerves how much GT as a school is blamed for students’ mental health problems. Yes, the school is hard. Yes, the school may exacerbate existing problems in a student. But that doesn’t mean that it is solely the school’s fault for your depression or what have you. A lot of the stuff that plays into that is the way you live your own life, the relationships and goals you have etc. 

Essentially, y’alls argument is “I am depressed solely because of the school. I made bad grades, I was put under too much pressure, I was alienated from my social life etc. Therefore, the school should give me full coverage care for my issues because they are liable.” But really, you yourself are the most liable party. Maintaining your social life and not letting the stress get to you is an integral part of everyday life, and if you let those things go and you slipped into depression, you have to take some of that blame on yourself. It sucks to say, but a lot of us here are on the *brink* of depression, but we understand that and are proactive for our own mental health. We don’t let ourselves fall down and then blame GT.

comments,"I don’t think anybody is blaming GT solely for the problems, but it is an institution that seems to pretend to care more than actually try to help people paying for its services. The GT counseling center is brought up and promoted every time something goes wrong, but it has turned out to be a terrible experience for so many people - people who WERE being proactive by seeking it out and wanting to get help. 

I was one of the students going through a hard time and decided to get better by setting up an appointment to get professional help...only for my appointment to be set many weeks later and getting delayed yet again by another week one day before the appointment date. People want to get help before it’s too late and they do so on their own accord, but GT makes that pretty damn hard. 

Since I had soooo much time before anyone could get to me I ended up getting help elsewhere and coping on my own, but I know that GT’s services made me feel incredibly demotivated and I did feel that my problems weren’t worth their time unless I’m on the brink of killing myself.

comments,"Most college campuses don’t even keep track of suicide statistics, so it’s hard to provide a really solid source, but the fact that most colleges don’t keep those statistics kinda demonstrates how easy it is to be “average”. More on how bad it is here: https://apnews.com/8c3cdbf1fa22472fb33318e5499e888c (side note: u[sic]ga is one of the “schools” they call out for failing to accurately report data, but we all know that we’re capable of exceeding the standards of that school) 

So this, coupled with personal anecdotal evidence (which is based primarily on observations at the student health center of the OOS SEC school I transferred from and to two friends who’ve had experiences with two different mental health centers at OOS ACC schools) is where I kinda derive my nebulous “average” assignment from (quite honestly, we’re probably even a little better than par for the course).

I found a better source for when I first cited the MIT suicide rate statistic, but this Boston Globe article found that, of colleges that responded to their inquiry about suicide rates, that MIT had the highest: https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/16/suicide-rate-mit-higher-than-national-average/1aGWr7lRjiEyhoD1WIT78I/story.html

This article is also fairly stat-heavy with regard to MIT’s suicide problem: http://reappropriate.co/2015/05/asian-american-student-suicide-rate-at-mit-is-quadruple-the-national-average/

That's what the mindset *should* be, but depression isn't exactly logical, and most people looking to visit a counselor are past the point where they can will themselves into trying to fix their own situation. Saying ""we're all on the brink of depression, you just need to manage better"" is a really shitty attitude to have when it comes to mental illness- it only lays the blame on the person with the disorder and does nothing to fix this (widespread) issue.

If we could all be ""proactive for our own mental health"", there wouldn't be a need for the counseling center in the first place. Part of the reason it exists is to help people do just that, and it's the shittiest feeling in the world knowing that your appointment is several weeks out.

That being said: as a CmpE you can still fill your electives with ECE or CS classes, which gives you a lot of flexibility in what you want to focus on in your 3rd/4th years.

They need to make changes so badly. And they need to make reparations for the trauma they've caused their students by wrongfully sending them to psycho-wards. And turning people away because they don't have enough resources. And making people wait weeks before they get to talk to someone because their issue isn't ""important enough"" to them.

The actual worst thing about all of this is that nothing will likely change, because the administration does not want to bring light to this issue.

I think where a lot of people go wrong is not using those 22 hours of electives well.

You probably picked the wrong major but you shouldn’t need to switch majors and lose like 20 credit hours.

comments,"One of the legal forms which allows the state to commit students at Tech to places like Ridgeview without the consent/consulting of students is Form 1013. These forms do not have to be filled by an MD and the requirements necessary for a professional to fill one of these forms are slight. A student does not even have to be aware that one has been diagnosed by a physician/psychologist/social worker or to have the name of the physician in order for the form to be filled and the police to be contacted to transfer a student to a place like Ridgeview. There are procedures to request an alternative diagnosis, but this involves a lengthy process which involves informing the physician you are assigned to of your intent and a court hearing. The same type of procedure is in place for those attempting to terminate the involuntary commitment.",positive,0.775,positive,0.1479166666666667,12/02/2018

comments,"A bit of advice and constructive criticism: I have been here a while, long enough to know the ins and outs of Tech’s administration and SGA. I think what y’all have done this year and with this reddit account is very much a step in the right direction. However, please don’t fall into the trap of becoming gatekeepers. SGA has always had this annoying tendency to become gatekeepers of knowledge, “power”, etc. Your job isn’t to do everything for students and know things and purposely not tell, it’s to empower students to make changes and recommendations themselves. And look I understand the student apathy problem, it’s a lot easier to complain then to actually contact someone or write an email, but when you say things like you will contact someone in this department and this administrator and whoever, it can make students feel powerless and that the only voice they have is through SGA.  SGA should not be the only group with knowledge, SGA reps and veeps shouldn’t be the only ones contacting those in charge, that breeds arrogance. They work for us, not SGA and not themselves. So please, reach out on students’ behalf, but don’t make it so they can only do that through you, avoid being a gatekeeper at all costs. SGA shouldn’t know more or have any more power than an average student here. But since you do (or sometimes think you do), use it wisely and I’ve sat through enough budget meetings to know that doesn’t always happen lol.

**Quick Lane Bowl**
&gt;$175 Best Buy gift card, JBL bluetooth headphones, life-sized Fathead decal for each participant of his likeness, Ogio backpack and tag, mini-helmet, hoodie, workout shorts, winter hat, vintage football.

**Military Bowl** (Virginia Tech)
&gt;Rock ‘Em socks, Under Armour beanie and backpack.

**Belk Bowl** (Virginia)
&gt;Shopping trip to Belk department store, Fossil watch. 

**Music City Bowl** (Didn't pick an ACC team)

**Gator Bowl** (called the Taxslayer Bowl last year) (NC State)

**Independence Bowl** (Duke)

Hopefully fixing the source of the issue now and making administrators aware of the issue will keep it from happening again, but I can't guarantee this. If we can get students to feel comfortable reaching out to the administrators and get administrators to show to these students that they're listening to and acknowledging concerns, that would be ideal. 

I know it seems like we're posting a lot recently saying we're ""talking to administrators"" about issues. Moving forward, I would love to see an open communication between students and administrators where we can be utilized mostly in instances where there is additional action needed. There shouldn't have to be a middleman between our administration and our student body, but it has very much become that way.

Riding alongside parked cars is one of the most dangerous parts of cycling and you should always be looking to see if someone is going to open a door in your face.

comments,"I've had a very, very positive experience. It's an extremely elegant place to live as a young person, maintenance takes its job seriously (maybe a little too seriously), the amenities are awesome, and there are lots of cute dogs. It's insane to think that I'd be paying more to live on campus. And it definitely should be cheap for you if you're splitting a one-bedroom unit with your roommate.

Fees-wise, we had to put down a pretty big security deposit. I guess that's the big one. And the utility services -- which are not included in the monthly rent -- have all had their own hidden fees (e.g. setup/initialization fee).

I definitely don't recommend moving here if you're planning on counting pennies / having a very specific and tight budget, as the specific monthly cost is hard to predict. Hidden fees aside, utilities are a variable cost in the adult world, and therefore rarely ever predictable.

I probably also spent a lot more on furniture than I expected I would. Make sure you're accounting for that...",positive,0.9685,positive,0.07893600507236868,12/04/2018
comments,"To directly answer your question: assuming you're up to a 3.5, you shouldn't worry about your grades. 

As others have commented, it's definitely possible to get in while in the 3.0 - 3.5 range, although the closer you get to the lower end, the more you'll have to do to outside of class to make up for it. Don't really know of anyone that got in with less than a 3.0, but I doubt that it's literally impossible: I know of people who have been researchers, interns at top companies, and even TAs, with sub-3.0 GPAs. Those things tend to lead to grad school acceptances when coupled with a good GRE score and good rec letters.

Research and internships are excellent sources of recommendation letters. They're worth your time. In general, you'd be in pretty good shape with a letter from a professor that taught you, a letter from a researcher/professor that you did research for, and a letter from your internship supervisor / boss.

Good luck, and let me know if you'd like to chat with any AE grad students. I know quite a few.",positive,0.9904,positive,0.2745098039215686,12/04/2018

comments,"Then it's probably CompE or CS with devices and sysarch.  Like someone else said, you don't have to let your major decide what you end up doing in life.  So I would choose whichever you think will be more enjoyable.  Can't speak to CompE or really sysarch (haven't taken OS classes) but the devices thread allows you to take some cool classes involving robots, embedded systems, and processor design.  Processor design is in Verilog, and you write code which is synthesised into actual hardware.  So you get the slightly higher level understanding, but still have to take into account things like propagation delay.

Honestly I don't recommend CS to anyone unless you really like it.  Anything they are teaching comes from books or the internet, so it's easy to teach yourself the relevant stuff.  If you want to learn how to actually build hardware, maybe CompE is the better route. A full degree in CS will make you check a lot of boxes you might not be interested in checking (combinatorics, the agile class, networking, algorithms, etc)",positive,0.9543,positive,0.3184895833333333,12/04/2018

comments,"Utilities have been all the place, often times unpredictably so. For two people, you should maybe each budget $100 for everything (power, gas, water/sewer, Google Fiber, renter’s insurance) on top of the fixed rent + maintenance amounts and you’ll be good. Most of the time it won’t come close to that, but there’s definitely peace of mind associated with setting a high budget &amp; not neurotically minimizing utility usage. 

I spent quite a bit on my couch, mattress, and TV stand, but that was a personal choice. Nothing stops you from having inexpensive furniture, but in my experience you get what you pay for in terms of comfort, build quality, and aesthetics. And I’m kind of a introverted potato, so I really value soft surfaces / materials (your priorities and lifestyle may differ from mine). But one fact is inevitable: the apartments are really beautiful, so ugly furniture will really stick out. 

Also, a word of advice — don’t split each furniture purchase 50/50. That only ever leads to headaches and conflict if you two ever stop being roommates. Instead, make a list and divide the purchases between yourselves, so that there’s no uncertainty about who owns what.  ",positive,0.8522,positive,0.17313725490196077,12/04/2018

But to everyone blaming Georgia Tech and making it seem like we have a suicide epidemic specific to our school: National suicide rates are at 13.42 suicides annually per 100000 US citizens (as of 2016). Adjusted for our schools population, that would be 4.67 suicides annually.

From what I recall of this year, that really isn’t too far off of the real number. Even if we are at 7 or 8, it is unsurprising that a more stressful environment than the typical American is currently enduring would yield more suicides than average. It’s not some huge epidemic that GT needs to deal with, it is a fact of life in America.

There are so many promises that have been made and not kept.  I have stayed up so many nights on suicide watch because my fellow students had nowhere to turn.

Maybe we are seeing these events more publicized because families want to raise awareness; a friend of mine committed suicide in 2016 and Tech very much discouraged the family from sending anything publicly.  They felt forced into a decision, and just sent a general form email to the school announcing his death.

I knew 6 people (very) personally who took their own life during undergrad.  To me, it seems like an epidemic.  It is not fair to those who have tried again and again to reform mental health services - and to those who have serious mental health issues caused by Tech's culture - to say that suicide is just ""a fact of life in America.""

Either way, hang in there, I can attest that it does get better.

comments,"You're making suicide sound like an inevitable part of life when it's more like a preventable disease. I'm not saying suicide can be entirely eliminated, but we need to realize that these numbers could be much lower (in the US and GT) if we take deliberate action to prevent suicide.

This may seem unrelated but stick with me (or watch this video and skip this paragraph https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlFnPAydJgk&amp;t=444s). Think about a car crash. When there's a car crash, nobody really cares that much because they this it's just an inevitable part of life. Cars crash all the time, it's an unavoidable risk of driving. Yet when a plane crashes, everyone freaks out and pilots and engineers all get together to figure out what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again. Plane crashes aren't viewed as inevitable, they're a problem that needs to be analyzed and prevented in the future. Car crashes and plane crashes can't be directly compared given the differences in scope, but if we apply this ""car crash"" mentality and ""plane crash"" mentality to different hospitals in how they view line infections, there's a much lower number of deaths due to infection in hospitals with the plane crash mentality.

Sure what you said may make statistical sense, but GT doesn't HAVE to be like the rest of the US. It doesn't have to be worse either. If we all recognize how big of a problem this is and fight for change, there's no reason we can't be much, much better than the average. We already are in academics. 
I just wanted to say this so that nobody reads this and thinks it ISN'T GT's fault. If we're just at the average numbers, then GT isn't doing enough to prevent suicide. It absolutely is an epidemic that GT needs to deal with, whether you compare it to the rest of America or not.

I found out that public universities don’t have to track this data and publicly report it because it would be an absolute PR nightmare. I assume student deaths are tracked and reported to a higher agency but there are no requirements for public universities to publicly report suicide rates. https://www.science37.com/blog/college-depression-suicide-data/ 

And then I started thinking about how the public could get that data.. The CDC started doing research on guns from a public health perspective, so i assume an institution like that could do this type of research and would have access to the records of public universities. 

GT students need to come together and demand that GT starts tracking these numbers and taking a scientific approach to the unacceptable number of suicides we experience on campus.

Additionally, GT students in public health and psych and pre med could research this with the CDC and that study would be important on a national level. GT could get ahead of the PR nightmare and lead a campaign to get data from all public universities.

I understand your point, but I don't think that it really matches the state of the American university system. Colleges (including GT) bill themselves as a place where students can come and be a part of a community, essentially as a stepping stone between living with your parents and being out on your own. It's not the cold knowledge transfer that you imply. And in that respect they are, in some way, responsible for things like mental health. ",positive,0.8847,neutral,0.042857142857142864,12/04/2018

Also she said in her email “make an appointment if you want to discuss this”... (I’d had an appointment scheduled to meet with her later this afternoon for two weeks...)

Maybe that is caused by other aspects of tech, I don’t know. But the stress of $30k alone doesn't lead a mentally healthy person to consider suicide, and you can't blame that situation alone on causing you to rationalize suicide. I fully understand how much money that is. No amount of money is worth a life, and a mentally healthy person will easily realize that. Again, I do not intend to be patronizing. Mental struggles are a result of so so many things acting together. I just really strongly feel we can't say that all of those things are tech related.

I don’t want to offend anyone, but ending your life is not brave and should not make you a martyr. What is brave is every day you live your best life and try to make the world a little better even when it doesn’t feel like you can.

It’s incredibly sad that so many people are hurting so much that they believe ending their life will make things better. The truth is suicide only makes things worse. Just look at how it always comes in waves. When Scout died, several of their friends followed shortly after. And to make it even worse, we still saw no real and significant change.

The way we can make a difference is insisting as a student body (and in the future as alumni who GT counts on for $) that Georgia Tech needs to value students mental health. I personally plan on writing some letters to Georgia Tech administration highlighting the negative experiences I have had with the mental health services and the overall academic environment, which can be downright toxic. I encourage all of you to also make yourselves heard.

And by all means, if you ever feel like your life isn’t worth living or you feel otherwise depressed, anxious, etc talk to someone about it.

Within SGA, I know that we have the ability to pass resolutions. These are essentially statements from SGA on certain topics, and there have been times in the past where we stated our support/lack of support for things due to overwhelming student body opinion in favor or in opposition of it (ex. campus carry: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2KiTttISh7mUWtiX2RnZTN6d2s/view?fbclid=IwAR282vQ553QCGQL7guNiYAv8ZuJfKgz5swREhSK384MnOVrB59Tr0VUMzj8](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2KiTttISh7mUWtiX2RnZTN6d2s/view?fbclid=IwAR282vQ553QCGQL7guNiYAv8ZuJfKgz5swREhSK384MnOVrB59Tr0VUMzj8)).

Any one of them will be happy to sit down and speak with you about what you would like to see from SGA. I will say that we are hoping to get mental health funded more outside of SGA. 

I am a representative and will be happy to speak with you (or anyone else who wants to come) face-to-face while I'm holding office hours tomorrow from 11AM-5PM in the SGA office. I will be speaking with Dean Stein and the head of the Counseling Center on Friday about some concerns I've heard from students, so if you have anything you would like me to express or bring up during that meeting please let me know. I also recommend getting in touch with them personally if possible- while hearing from SGA is something that can be effective, nothing helps make a change more than an influx of people voicing their experiences or opinions on a specific issue directly!

comments,"I’ve thought about killing myself after transferring here two years ago. Most of the time it was just small thoughts or quick day dreams, which I knew would lead to nothing. 

Then one day, after Fall 2017, I almost did it. I found out my grades for semester and I failed 2110. I was only a couple points off by my calculation. I blamed myself. I felt like an idiot. I felt like I wasn’t worthy of bothering to even go to school. I felt as though I was a disappointment to my friends and family. I was scared to face my parents and I was scared to think I wouldn’t graduate in four years with my best friends.

So I started driving to a lake nearby my parents home. I was going to just drive right in and what happened would just happen. But I didn’t. I couldn’t. I thought of my sweet old mom having to bury her youngest son, who she fought tooth and nail to keep alive after being born with complications. I thought of my best friends who would have to go a whole semester and a year without a roommate. I’m sure my loud, idiot presence would be missed, or so I hope. I imagined my fat orange cat who graciously waits for me to come home from college on the weekends, laying on my bed eternally. I thought to myself: there is more to life than just me and school. 

I ended up driving home and talking about my semester with my parents. Surprisingly, they were so supportive of me. In high school they’d yell or just make me feel bad that I’m not doing well enough (brown parents 😂).But they understood Tech wasn’t the same and they told me it’s okay to fail. And that whenever I do, they’ll be there to catch me and support me. I didn’t tell them about my plans to kill myself. But I’m thankful for their words.

After last week, with the suicide, my dad called me up and told me my mother was crying. He informed me she was worried that I’d kill myself too because she knew how stressed I was due to the amount of credits I’m attempting in order to graduate on time. Then for one of the few times in my life, I heard my dad cry. And he told me that it doesn’t matter what grades I get, or when I graduate. They told me what matters is what I make of life and that I’m happy with it. If that means not going to school, or if that means just hanging at home for a few years, they’re behind me 100%. I wasn’t planning on doing anything, as despite the stress I am happy right now with life. But I was taken back. 

For anyone reading this that doesn’t feel good about life or just feels shit about school. You’re not alone. Grades and graduation dates do not determine who you are. You are beyond a number. You are flesh, blood and love. You have family and friends that love you. You have a personality, hobbies, interests and are allowed happiness. If you ever find yourself stressed after studying for hours upon hours, pause and do something else. Call a parent or sibling. Text a friend. Watch TV or play games. Go to the gym. We have so many other things to do in 2018, just do something.  And if you don’t want to do any of those or don’t have anyone to talk to, please message me. I’ll talk to you.

I was one of the people who wrote a message like the ones you refer to but never with the intention of normalizing mental health issues but because I personally never really felt like I could talk to my friends or family about this in the past. Some people just need someone to listen. 

Anxiety and depression don't manifest themselves the same way in every person; while some may seclude themselves others might not, and while some might benefit from social interactions like going out or being around friends, this may not be the case for others and may exacerbate the problem.

Even though our opinions are based on our own experiences, we have to take into account not everyone goes through things the same way. In other words, if you see someone struggling dont just offer to help but, as OP mentioned, actively seek to incorporate them into your plans. Although we might not know what will work best we can only try our hardest and hope something we do puts a smile on their face.

Nothing seems to have changed, and that is very sad. Tech can be a miserable place. Unless you are at the top of the class, it can feel like nothing you do is good enough even though you try as hard as you can to do well. As a student, you are a machine that turns coffee into work, not a real person. There is value in struggling and growing into a better student, but Tech takes that to a toxic extreme. 

That being said, the administration knows what kind of environment we have here. They act sad and shocked when things like this happen, but do very little to try and change things. It’s not going to make Tech less of a school to be slightly less rigorous, and it’s not going to make Tech less of a school to add resources to make mental health a priority. I know that talking about suicide leads to copycat deaths, but that also gives them the perfect cover to sweep this under the rug and hope for less casualties next semester. We can’t keep sweeping this under the rug.

comments,"Your thoughtful post brings forward a comment I have wanted to address. I am so glad to hear about the support your parents are giving you. Actually in tears here because I know that most parents would respond that way and I also understand the reluctance students have about having these discussions with their families. 

Speaking from the parent perspective, do not be afraid that you will disappoint us in any way. We love you and we want nothing more than for you to be happy in life. We're here to support you and we realize that sometimes there are twists in the road and we know that rest stops are there for a reason.

In fact, many of us parents have experienced depression and anxiety that you may not be aware of. We can help you through this, no doubt.

We also know you - what you enjoy, what you don't like, your strengths, your insecurities... yes, we all have them. 

Here's how the conversation starts: "" I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed this semester, and I'd like to talk about it."" Then offer them some specifics so they can get a sense of what is stressing you. They may not have answers right away, but their support will help you.

I know a young man who was deeply into drugs and essentially leading a double life because no one knew about it, not even his wife. Eventually he was arrested and now he gives talks to students about his experience. I've heard him say that the day his charade came to an end he had the best night of sleep in years. I suspect that opening up to your family will probably bring you this type of relief as well. The stressors will still be there, but an honest discussion will help you gain additional perspective.

If you are depressed or anxious, and staying silent, please begin this conversation with your parents, a sibling, or other trusted family member.    

As a final note, after having this discussion please consider taking advantage of your parents insurance benefits and seek professional help during break. I have not seen any comments on this, but perhaps you have not sought mental health services in your home community because your family is not aware of your struggles. An open conversation will lead to this opportunity, already a positive step.",positive,0.992,positive,0.223678107606679,12/05/2018

This university has a harmful stereotype, and I honestly do not know what the administration is doing about it since I've been reading here at Reddit and been working here at Georgia Tech.

He now works for a top company (you definitely know the name) doing what he wants to do. It took a few years, a couple of different jobs, and a little bit of gumption and persistence, but he got there. Many of his engineering friends faced the same path and are doing great things; maybe not what they planned or how they saw themselves doing it, but they got there.

comments,"That's not at all what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that no matter how many people care about you, if you keep putting yourself into situations that consistently make you unhappy, you have nobody to blame but yourself. Responsibility isn't about assigning fault so much as it is about accepting that regardless of whose fault these problems are, nobody else can solve them. Nobody else exists in your mind; internally, you are alone – in light of this, you have to realize that nobody but you is capable of fixing you. We may live in a society, but if you expect other people to put your well-being ahead of theirs, you are going to be constantly disappointed by humanity; life doesn't work that way.

That is not to say that people cannot help you along the way, or that some of them will truly care about you, but at the end of the day, the responsibility for all your shortcomings rests on your shoulders and your shoulders alone. They can try to help, but if you aren't accepting their help, or if you aren't willing to make the changes they're encouraging you to make, you're going to continue to be unhappy.

comments,"I would say we have a fair bit of sway, especially depending on the issue. Not many people realize the sheer size of SGA- our committees generally have anywhere from 3-25+ members. On top of that, you have VPs, Presidents, and Representatives. Most of these people meet with administrators at least once. From my experience with dining and campus life, administrators have been absolutely amazing and super easy to work with. There are certainly some areas that may be more difficult for us to make changes in quickly, but even still administrators are often inclined to at least listen to SGA reps who come and speak with them, as our duty is to represent the student body and theirs should be as well. 

Some past examples: 

\-Special Institutional Fee : Grad SGA pushed to get this reduced by around $200 so far for graduate students from around $445. This will eventually be going down to $0

\-Dining : We had students directly involved in the RFP process. This included voicing our experiences and opinions we had heard from the student body. I can't say much more than that right now since I have yet to hear from the Office of Procurement regarding the official release of the decision, but I can assure you we had students who were able to directly voice opinions during the process.

\-Sustainability : Everything from working to get composting added in WV to now trying to get plastic straws removed from dining halls.

\-Student Center: We've been able to work pretty closely with the new Student Center team to ensure that certain things stay or go. This helped a lot when Under the Couch was being debated (shoutout to the Musician's Network as well, who some of our reps worked with to save it)- we actually had someone come and speak to UHR about this and how we could keep it in the new SC without removing any already planned projects.

I'll speak with some reps today and see if I can get you some more specific examples as well! I'm new to SGA this year so I'm citing what I've heard of since then.",positive,0.986,positive,0.1619377447948877,12/05/2018

comments,"To preface, I respect that the administration is attempting to help the student body. I realize that this is something that has been talked about a good bit, but based on this latest instagram post by georgia tech, I thoroughly believe that those in charge don't understand the problem. While it is clear that they are trying to help, this is evidence that they dont understand student life and the reasons that students are pushed to states of bad mental health. This institute is very rigorous and because of this students have high levels of stress and low levels of sleep. Among many other causes, this is why Georgia Tech students often face mental health issues. And I'm not directly saying that Georgia Tech is responsible for providing help for all of this, but the fact that they claim that they are here to help is what makes this upsetting. 

They claim to have students interest in mind and though they actually may, their actions are not nearly as helpful as they could be with just a little more thought. Open Door day is a very good idea, dont get me wrong, but the irony of the situation is that Georgia Tech allots a single day in which students dont have classes to allow them to study for finals. While I'm not going to get into the debate about whether this is a sufficient reading period, I will acknowledge that this is when students' stresses are at their peak. Making open door day fall on only day that these students have been given to prepare for finals is a joke. The students who need help are likely so stressed about classes that they will sacrifice their health to do well because of the importance that is put on finals. 

Students are not going to take time out of their only dedicated reading day to get help for the exact reason they need help, being their stress from school and grades. Of course this makes a few generalizations and assumptions but I believe it to be accurate in most cases. Open door day should be a very recurring thing throughout the year not just a single day, and it especially shouldn't be on the only day that the institute gives us to study and prepare. It just goes to show that the administration doesn't understand the problem and I want to use this platform to educate. I do appreciate their willingness to help, but I would really like to see them connect with students and hit at the root of the problem that is clearly not being seen at the moment. 

TLDR; Open door day being on the same day as our only reading day shows how much the administration does not understand the concerns and problems that students currently face regarding mental health. ",positive,0.9923,positive,0.07653911564625851,12/05/2018

comments,"Personally, I feel really passionately about campus services (particularly dining and PTS) as well as mental health initiatives and communication with administrators. 

I have some strange dietary issues as well as some mobility issues that prevent me from being able to walk across campus some days, and I have seen that there is a LOT of room for improvement in campus services. They seem to be areas that many people talk about but not many address or make changes in (I feel similarly to mental health and communications as well), and I would love to see that changed. There shouldn't be multi-hour waits for food when it snows. We shouldn't see 2+ posts a week about someone finding a bug in their food. People should be able to find food that meets their dietary restrictions any given day, any given time, without having to wait 30+ minutes. Those with mobility issues should be able to rely on the buses or other forms of transport to get them to class reliably, on time, and consistently. These are things that I would like to see happen on campus, but we have a long way to go. 

I have immediate family and very close friends who have been directly affected by mental health. Last year, I had to contact GTPD for help because I got a phone call from a friend who was having a mental health crisis. They are absolutely amazing. On campus, I'd be interested in exploring things such as partnering with Emory's Postdoc counseling program, integrating programs into GT1000 that aim to destigmatize mental health and encourage seeking counseling even before it's needed, and ensuring we partner with highly-ranked mental health centers outside of the school that we can confidently recommend students go to for additional help. I think this is a big issue on any campus, and I would love to see more collaboration between our students who have personal experience with mental health challenges and administrators. Additionally, it would be great if we could decrease the amount of time it takes to get an appointment with a counselor. 

As a spinoff of that, I'd like to work on building more open lines of communication between administration and the student body. I wasn't in SGA last year (besides FreShGA, which doesn't have much involvement with the rest of SGA), and I definitely felt like the entire organization was mysterious and hard to bring myself to approach. I would love to see our role become one where students feel like they can come to us about anything they'd like to see changed on campus and we can help get them in touch with the right people to make those changes happen.

The Grad and Undergrad SGA Presidents sit on the Athletics Association [Board of Trustees](http://ramblinwreck.com/gtaa-board-of-trustees/) as voting members. The Trustees approve the annual budget and have decision-making authority over hiring/firing of coaches. The Mandatory Student Fee Advisory Committee ([MSFAC](http://www.budgets.gatech.edu/mResources/MSFAC)) reviews fees annually and makes recommendations for changes to President Peterson -- it is composed of a majority of students (8 to 4), appointed by the respective SGA Presidents. The SGA Presidents serve on the Georgia Tech Advisory Board, Georgia Tech Alumni Association Board of Trustees (ex-officio), Faculty Senate (ex-officio), and meet regularly with the Dean of Students. All 10 [Executive Cabinet](http://www.sga.gatech.edu/ug/?q=executive) members meet regularly with their respective administrators to voice student opinion, direct initiatives, and get feedback on our own efforts. The Undergraduate House of Representatives (UHR) and Graduate Student Senate (GSS) have public discussion about our direction and can push administrators for action through resolutions. In the past, they've passed resolutions on topics from Georgia [legislation](http://jacketpages.gatech.edu/bills/view/2704) changing GTPD jurisdiction to [space](http://jacketpages.gatech.edu/bills/view/2876) for Under the Couch in the campus center. We are heavily involved in the Path Forward initiative at Tech and know that it's moving slowly - we're pushing constantly for changes to that process that we hope will result in more accomplishments as we move into next semester. Finally, administrators from President Peterson down to faculty call on elected members for feedback or how best to approach an issue. In these spaces, we are extremely influential. In others, we are bound by the same forces that bind our administrators. All this being said, all of our leadership is eager to meet to talk about how we're doing or just chat about school and life. All of our contact info is public on the SGA [website](http://sga.gatech.edu/landing/).",positive,0.9769,positive,0.07588383838383837,12/05/2018
comments,"Based on the national rates of suicide for individuals aged 15-24, one suicide occurs per year for every 7,600 individuals in that age bracket. With Tech's student population, we should expect 3.5 suicides per year. I know Tech doesn't publish all its data, but it seems like we're around the national average. Of course, as a prestigious institution, we should hope to be better than average. Of course, we should always be making efforts to make sure people are given the resources they need. I think there's a chance that the suicides we are seeing are normal, and this isn't the fault of the administration or tech's culture or lack of resources or anything. Maybe there genuinely isn't anything we can do about it, other than be nice to each other.",positive,0.9386,positive,0.15,12/05/2018

comments,"So this is definitely a tough one. Part of our goal moving forward is to bring students and administrators together so students can go to them directly when they run into issues and hold them accountable when they don't see things being addressed. 

I think a big thing I've seen here is the difference between communicating problems and addressing them. Through my experiences with dining specifically, there seems to be a lack of knowledge of student opinion from administrators, which I would love to see changed moving forward. This seems to be a huge contributor to why things seem to be not happening at an administrative level. Right now, SGA is the main way that gap is being bridged in many areas through communicating student opinions to administrators whose job is to then handle them. 

I as much as anyone completely understand the sentiment of wanting to hold those in charge accountable. Looking forward, that will definitely be a combined effort between students, SGA, and administration. If you have any suggestions for how you think we should do that, definitely let us know!

comments,"Response from Andrew:

The total cost for the bench is actually $10,000 through the GT Development Office. They handle the naming of buildings, gates, plazas, classrooms, benches, etc. all over campus and these items have a monetary amount that goes with the dedication of the area. In this case, the money goes towards the dedication, the bench itself, the installation, and then upkeep over the lifetime of the bench. It may seem pricey (and I don't necessarily disagree), but the organization fundraised from their members and alumni and came to SGA for the rest. One thing to note is that the cost funded through JAC is split 50/50 between the student and administrative sides unless otherwise noted.

What's been happening is that the regulations we have in place (not sure if it's because of the company we're using or if it's a state law, but I can look into it if you would like) require that everything in the bags we give to the composting company we use be things that are able to be composted. What's happening is that people will throw things like plastic forks in the compost, and if that happens the workers are required to throw the entire bag away (the bags are clear so they can see inside). This is something the sustainability committee is working on with administrators- the two names I've heard are JulieAnne Williamson ([julieanne.williamson@carnegie.gatech.edu](mailto:julieanne.williamson@carnegie.gatech.edu)) and Sarah Neville ([sarah.neville@sustain.gatech.edu](mailto:sarah.neville@sustain.gatech.edu)), both of whom should be able to speak more on this topic and the regulations surrounding it if you reach out to them.

comments,"some counterpoints:

class size is very much dependent on your major. Im studying MSE, and i dont think there's been a class yet in which my professor did not at least know half the class by face (not necessarily name). the people i've made friends with are in most of my mse classes, and have been since i was a freshman, and probably will continue to be in my classes until we graduate. making friends in a class of 200 people takes effort, and if you dont want to put in that effort, thats understandable, but then you dont get to complain that you dont know the dude that always sits next to you. if you dont make effort to converse, how do you expect to have any kind of meaningful relationship with them?

some profs want to challenge you. i agree its unfair to keep students in the dark about how well they are doing, and its stressful. to this, there's the canvas feature that shows how well you do with respect to other people. some profs in the past would announce approximately what the A,B, C cutoffs were (ie avg = 55 , a = 60, b = 50, etc).

for housing, i live on campus, and i like the housing system. a 2:1 person:bathroom ratio is more than i could have asked for. you're taking for granted that you have your own private bedroom, which is not necessarily the case. some of my friends (4 of them) that do not attend tech live in a 400sqft ish room. they have a single bathroom/sink, and no kitchen. its basically just a large room with 4 beds that are about 5 feet apart. i think its normal to not have a private room, and i am grateful that tech has enough housing for all its undergraduates. water is always hot and available, theres no problems with electricity or other amenities, and internet is basically the fastest available unless you want to drop $100 on a 10 gbps ethernet expansion card.

comments,"You articulated some of the exact thoughts I've had about the culture at Tech. 100% agree about the isolation of huge lecture-based classes. I have almost no friends in my major because I don't interact with anyone in my classes for the majority of the day. It's just a cycle of walking to a class, sitting through it for an hour, and walking to another class - it's easy to go a whole day this way with minimal human interaction. This is the first semester I've made a friend in a class (one of those people I finally struck up a conversation with after noticing we shared FOUR classes and had never spoken) and it makes going to that class so much more enjoyable. The camaraderie of the shared experience and short conversations before and after class noticeably boosts my mood. If Tech hired more professors and taught smaller classes which incorporated discussion, I agree that it would create a sense of community that is currently lacking.

Also agree with what you said about professors. Additionally, Tech needs to address the abysmal teaching skills that most professors possess. Many of my professors have made it patently obvious that their research comes first and teaching is an unfortunate stipulation to that. They are unprepared, talk to the whiteboard in a monotone, spiral into tangents, and present material in the most bland way possible. Some of the best professors I've had are actually lecturers, so their primary job is to teach and they are much better at it! As a student, I am happier in classes where I am actually engaged and excited about the material, rather than suffering through a dull class because it's a requirement.

That being said, at the end of the day, we are the ones who decided to pay money to attend this school, knowing full well that there's tens of thousands of students here and classes are massive. I went to a high school with an average class size of about 12 students, so it's been pretty hard to adjust to impersonal nature of life at Tech, but it's really up to us to make the most of our experience. Yes, it may be hard to make friends in a class of 250, and if you're someone who has trouble socializing and connecting with people in such an environment it may feel isolating, but walking around campus every day you will see plenty of students who are generally happy and love this school. College is all about developing skills and expanding your horizons, and struggling to figure out your own solutions is a key to growing as an individual. All of us make choices to get ourselves in the positions that we are in, and it is up to the individual to go out make the most of it.

comments,"When I went to Tech (90s) it was literally bootcamp. When you got out, the people you met in the professional world from Tech knew you were a hardass because of your degree, because they ""got out"" too. The things you describe sound quite a bit to me like the generic GT experience. I think maybe the only main difference between then and now is:

1) The GPAs and retention rates back then were both much lower. Sounds to me from your description that profs basically just curve more now than they used to, but I'm not even clear about that, because I've literally gotten an 18% as my final grade and had that curved to a B. In the 90s, average GPA was like a 2.4 and a third of people admitted failed out.

2) The admin back then didn't pretend they weren't doing it. They'd say basically, *""yeah, we could teach you all this material and make it much easier, and you'd still learn it, but we're not going to do that. We make it hard on purpose. The goal is not to learn engineering scholarship, the goal is to mold you into an engineer.""*

And I think there was a lot more honesty in #2, because trust me, engineering jobs suck. They are very unfun. The stress is high, the expectations are often outrageous, and the best employees are ones who can pin their ears back, swim through the stress like a duck in water, and deliver a good product in the face of those ridiculous expectations. GT had a reputation back then for not just teaching engineering, but building *engineers*.

Bootcamp.

I wonder whether GT's shift in the past decade to raising GPAs and retention rates has hampered #2. I don't really know, but I wonder. A lot of older generation GT folks wonder the same thing.

\&gt; More on the professors- maybe it's just me, but a lot of them need a course on mental health. Not the, ""these are the warning signs of depression"" or ""this is how you spot a suicidal student"" classes, but the ""making all of your students think they're failing until the end of the semester and then curving the class at the end isn't cool"" course. Having a student go MONTHS on end working their ass off, stressing out, thinking that they're failing a class, and then you magically swooping in and ""making it work out"" in the end is not okay. I'm tired of being stressed all semester thinking I'm going to barely get a C in a class, only to pull out a B because you curve the class by 15 points. Put in the effort to make your exams accurately reflect the knowledge a person should have. If a person fails an exam, it should be because they failed to learn the material, not because the average was a 52, so really, they did better than a majority of the class. **I'm tired of seeing my classmates as competitors. I'm in a class right now where an A is awarded to the top 20% of the class. I'm sure you'll be \~shocked\~ to know that a majority of Piazza questions go unanswered because no one wants to help anyone get a better grade. Everyone is secretly hoping that everyone else does poorly, so they can look better**. I get that this is how it is in the real world, but at least in the real world, you have allies. You have a department to work with or an IT guy to help you. Here, you're in a massive lecture hall with no IT guy to joke with or Janice from HR to get lunch with. You're by yourself and there's no one leaving cake in the break room. Personally, my GPA doesn't define me, but it does define the tens of thousands of dollars in tuition scholarship that I get, and without it, I can't go to school here. So don't tell me that I shouldn't stress about the grade to begin with. 

There is a lot in here that I want to process and don't feel I can do it in one response.  There isn't anything you said that I disagree with but I want to talk about the part I highlighted. Many faculty (GT is &gt;50% full professor) came of age where grading on a 'bell curve' or pre-defining a grade distribution was the norm. Frankly, it no longer should be - it is out of line with modern educational practice. It is also more often than not a cover for poor instructional practices. Most faculty at GT are not promoted/rewarded for their education prowess, they may be lauded for it but they are not rewarded for it. That is the nature of a modern research institution. Whether that should or shouldn't be is off topic to this post though.

However, there are things you can do. In the end, GT does have the ability to define what a grade is. The university policy is here: [http://catalog.gatech.edu/rules/5/](http://catalog.gatech.edu/rules/5/). I would encourage students to work with SGA to advocate for changes in that policy that you think are more fair and reasonable. You could make it explicit that grades are absolute (i.e., based on individual performance against an equal standard) and that a 'bell curve' approach where grades are assigned based on relative-performance is not acceptable. Don't rely on faculty to change on their own, force GT to fix things that need to be fixed. They are hesitant because they don't want to intrude on 'faculty freedom.' However, when faculty being free to act a fool interferes with students rights and fair treatment they should and already do (e.g., a faculty member cannot unilaterally penalize you because they think you committed academic misconduct).

Separately, it may seem hard to believe, but most of the faculty do really care about the students. Some of them are just really bad at articulating or showing it - not an excuse just an observation. Some of them feel that assigning grades on a relative curve is actually pro-student, because it helps you know your performance relative to peers and motivates. As wrong as that may be, it is well intended (and yes, I know that doesn't help much). That doesn't change what you experience, but I'm hoping it might change your framing a bit - an assumption of malice only multiplies the feelings.

comments,"Not sure if this will help, but here are some general tips that I use to help me study. 

1.) Make sure you're sleeping enough (most important imo so it's number 1). If you don't have finals in between now and the final for this class take a nap maybe once a day too.

2.) Make a list of all the main topics that will be on the final exam and ration them out evenly among the days you have left before the exam. Leave 1 day of break or space just in case on one of the days you don't get through everything. 

3.) Study fundamentals if you don't have time to study details. Not sure what class this is, but a lot of academic areas have a set of fundamental - overarching ideas that drive most of the topics in the classes. Sometimes, it's comically simple how all the topics in a class relate to one idea. (For example, basically of LinAlg is basically orthogonality and symmetric matrices). If you can find the underlying concepts you can derive or reason out the more complex ones when you're taking the exam. 

4.) (Slightly related to 3) Look for connections between topics. Understand the ""story"" of your class and how each chapter relates to the others. This will also help recall if you're struggling to remember something exactly on the test. 

5.) If you feel like you're going to have a mental breakdown (I have these too), jump on a video call with a friend, take a break and go get cookout with your roommate, or just put on some music and clear your head for a while.

comments,"It’s one class. While it seems huge now, 5 or 10 years from now you will sometimes forget what you failed/almost failed. 

That being said, the fact that you care so much and want to do well is the reason that you will do well in Georgia Tech in the long run. Know that you will never let a class get this far again because you will learn to barge down professors doors and camp out at office hours if that means getting a C. 

What is important is now you don’t freak out. You take a breathe and work on giving the final the best chance you got. Don’t study hard, study smart and target what you think will be on the test, email TAs and professors if you have time. And most importantly take care of yourself and talk to someone when you start to panic. This has happened to me before and just getting a good scream and having someone be there helps a lot.

I made most of my best friends at Tech outside of classes.

Makes you kinda feel insignificant to the grand scheme of the university, definitely contributed to me skipping a big chunk of lecture. But I gotta say that happens at other large state schools, it's not unique to GT.

College is the easiest time in your life to meet other people, freshman year especially. Unless you're a social butterfly it's tough to befriend peers in lecture. I barely met anyone in lecture or recitation. Joining clubs was the key to me making any friends outside of class. After college it gets a lot harder to make friends...many of my classmates that have graduated and moved to new cities (even the most extroverted) ones always bring up when we catch up ""man it's hard to make friends as an adult"". And tbh the solution now is still the same: join clubs, get involved. Well now they're like office kickball leagues and not as cool as some of the common interest clubs available at GT.

Yes the professors do suck and I barely learned anything from my clearly research focused professors. But the isolation from lecture sizes can't be blamed, every other big school has that. The big culprits are combatting students with set percentiles for letter grades is archaic and stressful as fuck. Also seemingly being at the will of your professor's arbitrary grade curves that you only find out about at the end of the year.",positive,0.946,neutral,0.019586092012562607,12/06/2018

I would (wrongly) tell myself that GT has a culture of complaining and that it really could not be that much different at other colleges.

And wow was I wrong. I realized something was up in my junior year. There's a reason everything seemed to suck so much as it did. GT's goal is to extract as much money from its students as possible and preserve its brand. The ""diploma"" they hand you at graduation is actually a letter requesting you to donate to the institute. So the day I saw GT's business model as opposed to the material needs of the students it made more sense.

Dining: Did you know we contracted with Sodexo for our dining services? The same Sodexo that regularly fails health inspections and employs prison labor. We just outed them and signed a contract with Aramark, which is even worse.

Transportation: Years ago, bus drives tried to unionize and were immediately gutted. PTS then signed a contract with a company called Groome for buses. See the trend here? Notice how students have no say in these decisions and that the goal is always more privatization of services that should be public.

Bookstore: No comment needed.

Counseling: Others on this sub have spoken ad naseum about our mental health services. Know that not a single full-time counselor has been hired in over a year after a student was killed by campus police. Why? Competitive salaries are not being offered. President Peterson makes over 1 million a year though.

Psychiatry: $25 fee starting with the third appointment.

Can't help but compare these departments with UGA's and see that both dining and transportation are publicly run services and widely revered by students. They are also much more equipped with counselors for a school with 10,000 more students.

The value of Georgia Tech comes from seizing the opportunities that are given. Go compete with robotics/car/rocket/whatever teams, do research with some of the most highly cited professors in the world, volunteer at a makerspace and do your own thing. But also join the marching band, the dance groups, hang out at Under the Couch. Be a real person.

The biggest criticism I have of this post is the lecture halls thing. *There is nothing stopping you from asking the person next to you to go for lunch. That change starts with you.* And guess what? Once you make a real friend in class, you won't be posting questions anonymously to Piazza and complain about how nobody helps you, because you'll be working on homework with your friend, and their friends. Your test scores will go up because you studied with a friend, you didn't half ass it in your room while watching Netflix. *Administration can not do ANYTHING to make your life holistically better, it is up to you.*

You need to understand that the demographic here is mostly nerds that have been carried by people socially their whole lives. Nobody is going to waltz up to you and ask to be your friend and offer to solve your emotional problems for you. This isn't high school, you are not inherently valuable to your peers for being smart anymore. This hasn't sunk in for the vast majority of people here.

That being said, I'm an out of state student. I took advantage of everything I could here and I still wouldn't choose it over going in-state for free with the scholarships I earned in retrospect.

I'll be honest, I felt terrible when the semester ended, but my life didn't just fall into shambles. I did find myself in a rut for a few weeks, but once I stopped isolating myself and started talking to people about what I was going through it became much easier to handle. It was a lot easier to realize how this was just a small obstacle that I needed to overcome and in the long run it really didn't matter that much.

The next semester, I took it easy with a few credit hours and talked with a few resources on campus to help me become a better student because whatever I was doing wasn't working. Academic Success Center in Clough is great for that. They've got academic advisors (you can setup appointments pretty easily) that will sit down with you and help you create a success plan based on your needs (like it's seriously amazing how much they're capable of in a 20-30 min meeting).

Also, you've got Freshman Forgiveness :) GT understands that this transition from high school to university is insanely difficult for most people, so if you finish with a D or an F then you can retake up to two courses over one of the next few semesters and have the other one removed from your academic GPA calculations.

comments,I’m really sorry Tech made you feel the way you’re feeling. This school is extremely cutthroat and students really do emulate and perpetuate that. I’ve even been falsely accused of cheating in the name of a grade in a class that was graded on a curve saying top 20% of students get A’s top 60%-20% get Bs and no specifications on afterward - only note was that the bottom 15% of the class *will fail*. So it’s not hard to see why this happens. Nevertheless you’re not alone and I really hope that someone is able to make your day tomorrow and says hi to you on the street.

In essence, I've realized you're right. Saying he knew about it by all accounts is an exaggeration. It cannot be proven that he knew about it, and he almost definitely did not participate actively in these ventures.  I am, however, still willing to argue that he knew about it and was just very lax with his management style. If he knew of these offenses, then obviously, we have a bad character here, but if we he did not know how his left and right hand men were spending their time and money, we have a poor administrator. Especially considering the fact that there were no systems or checks in place, but this only came out because someone tipped the Georgia state University System's ethics line.

The hype surrounding Georgia Tech workloads is honestly more stressful than any of the workloads I've experienced here.

I'm not downplaying the stress that people experience here, and I do think that campus services ought to do more to help people manage it.

GT under Bud has also greatly expanded connections outside Tech and improved the qualifications of GT as a “Research Institution.”  A lot of that means securing millions in research funding.

The question is how much this matters to you given other problems you believe he could and should solve.  I’m an undergrad so the research component does not affect me much.

comments,"Judging by the way the upvotes of this post are so quickly fluctuating up and down, there are a lot of people who both agree and disagree. Personally I couldn’t agree more with what you said, and really like the way you articulated some things. There’s definitely a dichotomy at Tech of people who either love the place or can’t wait to get out. I think these groups are separated to a degree by those who quickly made meaningful relationships and those who did not. Tech doesn’t make it easy for these kinds of relationships to be organically formed, but I also agree that as a student body we don’t do enough to make this any better for ourselves. 

I think this is partially a remnant of the brutal culture of Tech’s past that other commenters have alluded to. It’s amazing to see the transition that a lot of freshman go through, coming in with high ambitions, only to see that many of the upperclassmen are counting down the days to graduation.

Trust me on this. Students at Tech aren't working any harder than they used to. The workload at Tech has always been more than any reasonable person could possibly do. At least back 3 decades, and I'd guess back way further than that. This isn't new.

That's not saying it's right or just, and not defending it. Just saying it is what it is. I have 2 GT degrees, my wife has 1 GT degree and 1 Stanford degree. I'm not sure I would ever send my kids to Tech.

Since suicide is the hot topic, here's a counterpoint. The reason for bootcamp in the military world is to create a ""safe space"" to harden people against the stresses they'll see in the field. The culture of Tech may increase suicides slightly while at school (I'm not convinced of this btw, I still haven't seen an analysis that shows GT suicide rates vs the national average) but the bootcamp may reduce workplace suicides post graduation.

comments,"The near entirety of your post is well-put, u/FreeHedgehog!  The mass-lecture model and excessive class size was a problem going back through the '80s when I was a student, from the weed-out Physics courses taught by Professor ""Staff"" through my senior AE courses with 50+ students per class.  The only time I was in a class with small class sizes was during summers (I went three summers, FWIW) when I had a couple of AE electives with maybe ten students in each.  I don't know the relative student population from the '80s when compared to now, but I feel society's ever-present quest that all institutions/businesses must ""grow"" is a problem, even for education -- more is not necessarily better.

I really appreciate that you made your post about something other than suicide/depression, while giving it a nod while starting out, plus also capping your post off with a mention of your personal struggles.  Yes, that subject area is extremely important, but those discussions unfortunately crowd out other valid subjects most of the time.

However, I feel the ""housing here SUCKS"" portion is overblown.  Students nowadays have more options than ever, and complaining about housing strikes me as whining based on folks' standards being too high.  Transportation might suck (and yes, I've read plenty of posts about it here), but on-campus housing isn't further apart than it was in the '80s and the Stinger didn't run in the evenings/nights back then.

comments,"I'm also faculty in engineering. Agree that there is a lot here, but wanted to add a few comments.

- By far, the vast majority of professors care about students. If they didn't, there is no reason to be here. There are other places to do research for a better quality of life (higher pay, fewer other responsibilities) than being at a public school. There's just no incentive to be here if you don't care about students. That being said, there are many I don't agree with on what ""caring"" should look like in the way that they interact (e.g. ""tough love"").

- I don't want to minimize your feelings of being alone....those are real. But in my opinion, blaming lecture hall classes is misplaced. I've been affiliated with many universities, and this is not unique to GT in any way. Many people find their community by getting involved with student groups, etc. GT has as much (if not more) of this type of activity than anywhere else I have seen.

- I would also contend that the rigor and grading policies are not unique (though I am not trying to argue that the large curve grading policies are good). I've seen this in every top-tier engineering program that I've been affiliated with. What is unusual at GT is what percentage of the campus are exposed to the very rigorous STEM programs. For example, a quick google search (could be wrong) shows that Berkeley's undergrad population of 30k students is about 11% engineering. Here, the college of engineering website says engineering degrees are more than 60% of our 15k students. I didn't look up computing or science, but that's going to skew things even further.

- Of all the places I've been, the thing that really strikes me as unique here is the adversarial relationship that is embedded in student faculty relationships. I've only seen it from the faculty perspective here obviously, but I'm shocked at how many students come into my classes with the default expectation that I'm trying to screw them and they are justified in doing anything (including cheating) just to get their grade, regardless of whether they learn anything. I've had classes where I've had to be more harsh than I would normally want to because I'm dealing with so much of this. In some ways, these attitudes are embedded in the language...I ""got out"". In most places, students are celebrating what they've accomplished and what potential the future hols for them, but here the focus is on the negative aspect of it. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think there are cultural things that the faculty should be doing (which my colleague above discussed). But, there are also huge cultural attitudes in the student body here that are unique and that you have a (collective) responsibility to change as well.

- I'm talking a lot about student faculty interactions a lot because that's my exposure. I'm not trying to minimize the other issues....they all play a role. I'm just speaking to what I know about.

- As to the comment about something changing in the last 5 years. It's true....the baseline anxiety levels on everyone seem to have increased dramatically. But, it's not just here on campus. It's true in every community and friend group I'm a part of, even the ones not affiliated with GT.

comments,"Perhaps bring this up to your major! 

I’m almost done with my my BME degree and there’s only been 2 classes where there has not been a group component. Either the classes are structured for PSS (problem solving studio) and then your group is whoever you chose to sit with or there is a group project component. Either way you have people to go through the class with. That’s something your major could integrate if you think it’s a problem!

I will admit I don’t really use piazza because I find it pretty useless (when I’m confused, one sentence question with a one sentence answer just won’t do it), but recently my courses have started making GroupMes for the class and those are much more helpful. People will post when and where they’re working on homeworks and others will go and do it with them. 

The other stuff is so true, although I will say Tech students are a lot more supportive (and less cutthroat) than other tech schools of our caliber. I will admit to not knowing a lot of IEs, but I see lots of support and peer-collaboration with my CS, and ME friends as well as my BME friends. Maybe it’s because our classes are structured differently in terms of the grading scale? Idk, that’s something else you can bring up to your department.

Better pedagogy almost by definition means more time spent on classes...in an anxiety heavy environment, it may be better to do...but the framing and the short term perspective makes those changes look/feel higher stress not lower stress.

One thing I'd be interested in hearing more about - your first point regarding research at a public institution vs a private one and the type of professors that attracts. My experience was maybe ~80/20. I felt that most of my professors genuinely cared about me learning the material. But a significant portion made it clear that teaching us was a necessary evil to continuing their real work.

Is it really that simple for a professor to complete similar research at a higher paying private institution? My expectation would be there are only a handful of schools which could match the resources available at GT and that those high paying spots would be in high demand. I'm just not sure I buy the claim that GT professors come here rather than MIT (for example) because they just love teaching. 

And at a higher level, GT as an institution clearly values research and the corporate dollars it brings in, over student - particularly undergraduate - happiness. In my time, I saw beautiful new labs being built all over (including the massively expensive new venture in tech square) but I still lived in a tiny dorm full of mold, ate Sodexo garbage, and had classes in skiles.

comments,"The administration pushed the profs to change the curves, and the institution had a Come to Jesus moment about weed out classes. (Emag/Remag/3Mag)

That sort of pressure is all over academia now. At the top end it's because of how USNWR ranks schools, but at a deeper level it's because of the student loan program itself. Used to be that failing students out was ok because you'd just replace them. Now, with student loans, the name of the game in most academic institutions (less so for tech because we get so much money from GTRI) is to kite students through a program and squeeze as much tuition out of them as possible, which basically means you can't fail anyone out.

I taught as an adjunct at SPSU for a while, and I had students who I literally caught cheating, or who skipped weeks worth of class doing no work, and I was instructed to give them whatever opportunities necessary to catch their grades up enough to keep them from failing out. The academic dynamic itself has changed tremendously since the 1990s, because of the student loan program. It used to be that the academies were gatekeepers of the diplomas, and only gave them out sparingly to people who put in the effort. Now the students are (again, less so for Tech because GTRI money) the customers, and it's bad business to cut your customer off. You want to extract as much money from your customer as possible. Especially when they're buying your product with borrowed money instead of their own money, because then they're less sensitive to their own ROI. (again, the ROI issue isn't a big deal for Tech, but definitely is for someone in Gender Studies at Georgia State, for example)

Your tag says you're a computing prof. Go pull the 1990s grades from CS1501. Do some analysis over time. That class was literal garbage, would absorb far more effort than what you got from it in terms of hourly credits, and did nothing meaningful other than turn successes into failures. It didn't even teach you a language you could use in your career. But it was great from a ""bootcamp"" perspective.

What year did they do away with 1501? Why? Dig into the internal academic/political answers to these questions.

comments,"Sorry if I wasn't clear. I wasn't trying to compare one university to another. I was comparing faculty jobs in general to non-faculty ones (ie, working for a company, a national lab, etc.). There is absolutely no question that most of us could make either significantly higher salaries or have significantly lower stress (ie, clocking out at 5pm with no need for grant writing, etc.) if did our research in anther type of institution. There are other benefits that come with working at a university (e.g., theoretically more autonomy), but for the majority of colleagues I talk to, training students was a primary factor in their decision to work at a university instead.

Yes, at a place like GT you are going to get faculty that are *also* passionate about their research. If they didn't, they would likely be at another type of institution that is primarily teaching focused. I know from your perspective that seems like something that competes with attention paid to the classroom, and to some degree there is truth to that in the sense that it's a zero sum game. But, I would caution you to be careful what you wish for.  For example:

- Do you like graduating with a degree from a top-5 institution according to USNWR and the doors that this ranking opens for you? Take a look at what goes into those rankings. It's different for grad and undergrad, but these rankings are driven just as much or if not more by our research activity than by the classroom. You could choose to go to a more teaching focused school, but there is a reason that there are significant opportunties for graduates here and a substantial part of that reason has to do with the research that goes on here (yes, I know this doesn't make sense, but it's true).

- You talked about facilities, but you have to look at the revenue streams that support them. How does a new building get paid for? Often the state chips in some money, we get some donations, and anything else has to have a revenue stream. It's not a student center vs. research lab decision in such simple terms. There are different pots of money that are available to make those different types of facilities possible.

- I know it feels like you're paying a lot for tuition (because you are). I have paid it and am saving to pay it for my kids now. But at a place like this, the research funding is a fundamental part of the budget model. If I remember right, I think something like 30%+ of our income is from ""sponsored research"", which is more than tuition or state funding (which are both in the ballpark of 20% I think). That money pays for real things, including facilities and people that are valuable to you. For example, professors pay (depending on department and seniority) anywhere from 25-75% of their own salary off of grants because the tuition/state money alone isn't nearly enough to cover it. If the research goes away, we couldn't pay for many of the people teaching your classes.

So, I get that it feels like there are competing missions, and to some degree there is truth in that. But I would be careful for wishing we would emphasize it less. There are places that focus on teaching and many people chose to go there and get a great education. But there are opportunities here that are attractive that brought you here, and many of those would not exist without this research activity.",positive,0.9974,positive,0.17879051842466476,12/06/2018

Faculty make changes to courses and curricula all the time. Sometimes those changes are dramatic.

The College completely blew up its undergrad curriculum a little over a decade ago to create threads. There was a lot of talk about increasing flexibility, a lot of talk about incorporating the growing breadth of the field, a lot of talk about attracting students with broader interests, and a lot of talk about preparing students for what we thought was coming in the work world.  There was not any pressure to make those changes to raise GPAs. I'm not sure it came up once, and I was involved every step of the way.  

It's not how the faculty conceive of their jobs. Better pedagogy may lead to better learning, more engagement, and thus better grades, but those changes are an effect not the motivator. We just don't have those conversations.

First, the ""vast majority"" of professors care about students. What does this mean? 60%? 80%? Because in my department (grad student), most don't. They write to publish, and often only teach on course per semester. There are plenty of reasons to stay here that aren't students- the pay (again, in my dept) is above average, the city of Atlanta is awesome, good weather etc, and there are tons of universities/colleges in the area where spouses or other family may be employed. So to say ""all the professors care, we wouldn't be here otherwise"" is total crap. Like even my own advisor is admittedly, ""not here for the teaching"".

I went to an ivy league undergrad, which Tech wants to so desperately be. These feelings of isolation at Tech ARE unique to tech. At my alma mater, I only took 3 classes in four years with more than 30 people, period. And there was a collegial atmosphere of ""well, we're all here, so we're all smart, let's get shit done"". So I'm not sure where your anecdotal evidence is coming from here, but based on my (also anecdotal evidence), saying ""many other universities are just like GT"" is disingenuous. 

The rest of your comment is basically anti-student and blaming the students and that's fine, it's your prerogative, but you are part of the problem the OP tried to call out.

Tech forces you to take responsibility for your actions, and you don't have much of a buffer. You screw up badly, yeah, you may not get a second chance in that class. But if you put in the work, keep your nose on the grindstone, it will shape you into an incredibly diligent, hard-worker who can outclass most of his peers without even feeling like he's really trying. 

The stress that Tech makes you pay in the short run is stress you won't have to pay in the long run. So while Tech's 4-5 years are exacting, the reward is a lower baseline of stress overall. ",negative,-0.9728,neutral,-0.011805555555555533,12/06/2018

comments,"I refuse to believe Shackelford gave up on CS1501 without a fight. As I say, that was *his baby.* I don't even think CS majors took it, it was the thing everyone else had to take and eat a C or a D on, while also impacting their grades in other classes because of the workload burden. It was widely known that your GPA would crash the quarter you took 1501 even within your other course load. Students would intentionally schedule around it, so the wouldn't take Emag and 1501 and Structures II (for instance) in the same quarter. An 18 hour student would bust themselves down to 12 or 15 hours the quarter they took 1501.

CS1501 was a weed out course. Everybody knew it. There were multiple weed out courses that were widely known among both the students and the faculty. Emag and CS1501 were paramount on the list. The concept of weed out courses was baked into the institution. GT would accept more freshman than it could graduate, knowing they were going to weed some out on their way to their degree with courses that were intentionally bullshit. 

And by my inspection, and talking to recent GT grads, GT expunged itself of weed out courses. That's not a bad thing. But it is a thing, and is part of the thing I'm talking about.

Whether that's true or not (and I know Shackleford well... in fact, I was a student when he first came to Tech), it does not follow that ""the administration"" pushed to change the curve. You're skipping a whole bunch of steps.

I'll leave it to current students to argue whether weed out courses still exist and how they feel about 1371; however, I will say that even the weed out courses I went through when I was an undergrad here still did not seem like ""intentional bullshit"" just like the place where you got hit hard.

comments,"Thanks for clarifying, it's clear now what you were referring to. One point I'd add - just because a professor cares about teaching doesn't mean they're good at it. When the hiring process values researchers over teachers, you get great researchers and often poor teachers (even if they are passionate about teaching). From our perspective as students it can be tough to tell if our professor doesn't care about teaching, or just isn't very good at it. So maybe we over state the actual level off apathy from our professors. 

Personally, I have no issue with the Georgia tech / research institute ""system"". I knew what I was getting in to. As an in state student, I got a full ride to the #1 ISyE program in the country. I benefited from the research efforts which earned that #1 ranking. I had no qualms going to a school where the quality of my experience was not the priority. But lots of students don't know what they're getting in to. 

Info sessions and orientations and weird videos from the president about open-door-mental-health-day market GT as a place that values the student experience and our health. The money indicates that this is simply not the priority. That is a conscious and justifiable decision. But incoming students have a right to know what they're getting in to, and many do not. So some take out thousands of dollars in loans to attend a school that doesn't prioritize their experience and end up hating it. Some trudge through, some drop out, some kill themselves. Myself and other commenters point out the negatives to being an undergrad here not because we don't understand why they exist, but because incoming students need to really consider the ramifications on their own health.

I think something that's particularly toxic that a lot of people don't talk about is an ""us vs them"" mentality even within the Chinese population. IDK how apparent it is to you but I've seen a lot of second generation Chinese Americans looking down on International Chinese students and vice versa.

comments,"All I know is what I remember, and the internet was not robust enough back then to source it, so I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. What I remember was a shift in administrative philosophy.

When I arrived, the low average GPA and the low retention rates of GT in the 1990s were literally a source of pride. They admitted in an article in the Technique that they did it on purpose. As administration shifted, their view of the thing shifted as well, to the realization that the GPA and retention rates were *""turning successes into failures.""* I'm not even sure that that's true, quite honestly, because every single person I know who failed out of Tech currently has a six figure salary. I know one guy who failed out of Tech twice, never made it to his third year, and whose family has a house on Lake Burton. His wife has an IE degree from Tech and hasn't worked in a decade.

&gt;I will say that even the weed out courses I went through when I was an undergrad here still did not seem like ""intentional bullshit"" just like the place where you got hit hard.

The Physics dept head (what was his name? Stafford or something?) would open his Emag class by saying, *""Traditionally, a third of my students fail this class. I expect this quarter to be no different.""* And then he'd light a cigarette, in a no smoking building, because it was *his building*.

He demonstrated clear intent from the word ""go."" My overwhelming sense is that that sort of behavior would catch him hell now. If you think differently, then fine, but that sort of thing was pervasive at the Institute in decades past.

Additionally, I would add stress due to some pathways having a massive backlog (case in point, I don't have a green card to this day, and because of that, it is that much harder to find scholarships because of fine print that most US citizens and permanent residents take for granted). Moreover, certain visa types (dependent ones, such as the H4 to the H1B) prevent people from seeking internships and getting the work experience their friends are getting. This leads to isolation with a side of self-blame that kicks in when they wonder if they would have gotten the job if they had been eligible.  

Those who are applying for green cards have extra hoops to jump through if they have a mental illness- including additional documentation from a civil surgeon (doctors who specifically perform the immigration medical exam) that they are not a threat to themselves or others.

Last year, fall 2017, I started as a freshman ME and of course I was initially super excited and proud that I had made it into Tech from a very small school where my graduating class had 88 people, most of whom went to community colleges. Almost as soon as I got onto campus, even I’m in FACET I began to realize how competitive and isolating it is to be on campus for lots of people.
In terms of classes, I only had one actual class that I enjoyed my first semester which was ME 1770, which was a very small classroom where my professor actually cared for her students. Other than that I was extremely isolated in large lectures and I was struggling horribly with mental health issues. 
I went to the counseling center and, in no fault of the faculty there, I was not able to be seen for 3 weeks. Once I did start at the counseling center all of the faculty was great but it was obvious that they were just not able to give the level of one-on-one personal care that many people need and they offered tons of “group therapy.” And while this may work for people who realized their issues early enough, it almost never helps people who are truly in a bad place. I was never once referred to the campus psychiatrist, even though I was not making much progress with traditional counseling. Hell I didn’t even know that there was a psychiatrist on campus until I did lots of digging online. 
In my spring semester my situation only got worse and I ended up petitioning and being granted a medical withdrawal from the entirety of Spring 2018. I originally planned to take the summer off and return in the fall, but since the antidepressants I initially tried were either not helping or actually making it worse I decided to take Fall 2018 as a gap semester to help myself. After lots of thinking I decided that Tech was not the place that I could be and I will not be returning to Tech to finish my degree. The campus environment is too competitive, toxic, and seems to have little care for students and all of the “academic help” programs felt to me like they were only offered because they had to be offered and there was little to no sincerity or actual help being offered. 
All of this being said, I am still proud that I was able to get into a top tier school like Tech, and I admire those who “make it out”, but it is not an environment or school that I want to be a part of anymore. Luckily I do still plan on getting my degree from another top tier public school, but it has taken me a long time to get here and I’m still going through hoops to get there.",positive,0.9838,positive,0.051832399626517284,12/06/2018

comments,"I am from out of state. The onus of burden is not on Tech to make friends for you. I made friends through clubs, people I interacted with in my first classes. Hell, to be straight with you, I would ask to study with whoever seemed like a socially competent person on the first day. Make a groupme for that class, meet up and work to study before tests. 

The onus of this burden isn't on Tech. It is 100% solely on you. I think a lot of people don't quite understand the ""no hand holding"" that goes on here. Maybe other colleges are different, I wouldn't know. But lately, I see soooooo many people say that they never interact with people in their classes. That is their own fault. I know its 10x as hard to break the cycle, but you can break it. One step at a time. You're in a club? Great! Find out who the president is, and chat that person up. Club leadership will generally have a vested interest in talking to people in their orgs, use that. Leverage their responsibility to make friends. It might be disingenuous sure, but it doesn't make any difference after a week.

Georgia Tech is **not** cutthroat. I have never ONCE been in a ""competition"" or some such other horseshit with a classmate that wouldn't help me because they wanted to succeed by ensuring my own failure (so to speak). 

Do you sleep 8 hours a night? When was the last day you exercised? What does your diet look like? If a lack on control and inability to make the decisions you want to make is affecting your ability to socialize, focus on improving yourself. Go to the gym everyday at 8 or 9 am. See the same people each day? Go say hi. Friendships start with surface level conversations, but grow quickly from there. It sounds like you have a lot of negative self talk that is impacting your ability to connect in a variety of ways. You know how you can prove you are great? Set goals, and *then go out and accomplish them*. Ie, gym 3x a week, make or get healthy food for 5 meals this week, sleep each night for 8 hours, get my homework done with 24 hours to spare. Study 3 hours today. Small steps, achievable goals.

Mental health is a taboo topic to many people - it is seen as weakness and some of us get blamed by our own parents for ""doing that to them"". You can't take a break from school, you can't even be part time. Suicide rates amongst young people in East Asia are grossly high for a reason. 

As for me personally, I'm not doing badly. I barely have friends from my country, as there are barely any of them here, and that's fine. My grades are fine.

comments,"I'm sorry that it irked you or came across as blaming students. I guess I wasn't clear enough with what I intended and I apologize for that. The one thing it was not was disingenuous. I meant every word of what I wrote and have dedicated significant portions of my life to serving students. I care, deeply. So, a few comments to try and clarify what I apparently missed the mark on.

- I don't disagree with a lot of what's being discussed. I am one part of a big machine and I have no impact on (or even interaction with) other parts of the machine. When you talk about everything from mental health to PTS, I don't have anything particular to add to that discussion. I have one viewpoint on this, and I wanted to add that where I thought it had some value. Take that for what it is: one person's opinion, but one person who sees the institute from a different perspective than you, who had seen other similar institutes, and who is on the other side of one (and only one) of the issues in the OP.

- In light of this point, I want to make more clear that I'm not trying to blame students to say that the culture problems here are their fault. I'm trying to balance the comments that there is contributing behavior from the faculty (especially historically, but still today) that contributes with the comment that students also have something that they bring to it and needs to change culturally for this place to be healthy. There's plenty of blame to go around. Again, I'm trying to add one view that's unique from what the OP was able to provide from the faculty side of the interaction.

- I'm confused about your reaction to the topic of class sizes. I did not say that there aren't places with smaller classes (there definitely are, especially at the ivy leagues which are dealing with a scale of money we can never approach). I am saying that many other places have large class sizes (i.e., we are not unique in that). Look at Berkeley, Michigan, Illinois, etc. They all have large classes. I'm also agreeing with you that other places don't have the same attitudes, so something else is contributing to the feeling of isolation beyond just the class sizes. The comparison in resources between Ivy and here is night and day....totally different institutions. Our endowment is something like $2B. Go look up any of the Ivy's endowments plus their tuition (and then divide by the number of students they are serving at one time, and the socioeconomic class those students come from).

- Regarding my comments about the vast majority of professors caring about students: this is only one data point (my observations) and you may have a different view on it, but I will stand by that observation. I interact with a lot of faculty in different capacities at the university, and I would characterize very few of them as not caring about their students (as well as their research). Is that 100% true....no, not at all. Despite your quotes around ""all the professors care"", that's not actually what I said. I'm sorry that it sounds like your interactions haven't been positive. I wish you had a better situation yourself. We certainly have self-serving people on our faculty just like any other organization. What I can say is that I interact at a significant level with a lot of them and feel like I get some insight into their intentions. By far, I think most people (not all) are well-intentioned. I don't have a number to put on it like you were asking for. Qualitatively, I would say that I am surprised when I encounter people who I think don't care about the students. Maybe that's 10-15%? I dunno how to put a number on it, especially because there are different degrees of caring and how that's expressed. That doesn't mean we are going to follow you to your dorm to make sure people have friend or go the counseling center if necessary. We have a role to play in this system, and I am only speaking to that role. As I said above, there are other parts of the system failing, but I can't speak to that as they're beyond how I interact with the institute.

- I would like to point out what I'm not trying to say in the point above. I'm not trying to say that they're good at it. Student interaction is on the job training that we're all still trying to learn. As a whole, STEM people can be socially awkward and that applies to faculty as much (probably more) than others. As a population, faculty in STEM are not always good at recognizing people's needs, but it's not for lack of caring. Finally, you said something about them ""only teaching one course per semester"". The number of courses taught is not an indicator of degree that someone cares. I do have research responsibilities that I care about and am obligated to. I teach one course a semester so I can do a better job with it than if I were teaching multiple courses in the same amount of time. As one of my colleagues in this thread said, it's a zero sum game. We're stressed too. I'm often up until 1,2,3am working. I know you are too. I'm trying to balance it with my own family that I also have responsibilities to. We are afraid of failure and that failure has a real impact on us (like, our salary not being fully paid if fail at parts of our job, which has a huge implication on my family).

You are trying to attack me, and I guess that's your prerogative as well. Rather than this discussion happening in a vacuum, I was trying to add a voice that you may not always get to hear from on the faculty side. You can have your own opinion about it, but I guarantee it was well-intentioned and not disingenuous in any way.",positive,0.9963,positive,0.05945939602566111,12/06/2018

comments,"&gt; I have almost no friends in my major because I don't interact with anyone in my classes for the majority of the day

Ohh boy. This is going to get me in trouble... But I made a decent chunk of my first Tech friends in those massive lecture-style classes. 

There is a way to survive this style of class, it's the same way you'd survive college as a whole: buddy-up. You don't have to wait until you don't get it, to try and quell your stress and then ask someone to be your study buddy. 

Would you consider yourself an introverted person? 
Maybe you're nervous or scared about talking to those around you. That's fine, but consider that interaction goes both ways. They may not be talking to you, but you are also to talking to them. 

Matlab, Diff Eq, Construction Law (at night of all times), and other classes of such, either from Day One if i knew it was going to be a doozy, or when the material started to kick my butt, I looked to the people next to me and asked ""What are you doing after class? Want to start a study group?""

I can understand that some classes do not create chances to organically interact with people.

Most undocumented immigrants actually overstay their visas.

Undocumented immigrants worry about being arrested and detained by ICE anytime, and face the risk of deportation when caught speeding. The US legal system is not more sympathetic to them; immigration enforcement violates internationally recognized human rights in a lot of cases.

I don't have strong opinion on what to change, but as someone that has developed some good relationships hopefully others will like reading about my experiences.

* I've always sat in large lecture halls with my friends, which is fun. I made a large effort to make CS friends shared my passions for the subject Freshman year by talking to as many people as I could in AI club (The Agency), hanging around the CoC (Not good unless you already know some people), and eating in dining halls with my majority-CS freshman squad. Since then, I've known people in all my CS classes, and I try to study with and around them as much as they let me. I know a lot of people don't study well without isolation, which sucks, but personally I find it much more enjoyable to be around people I know but can stay quiet with while studying.

* Since my CS friends don't want to do much fun stuff, I've had to find fun friends. At this point, that's my fraternity.

* Lower level CS class piazzas are lit. Honestly, smaller classes (other than Honors Discrete where the freshmen all have hardcore nerdyness in common lmao) had less people talking, both in person since they had less friends in classes, and on piazza.

* Most lectures I've been in are are pretty meh, from both lecturers and professors alike. HB was a bit of an exception, since she slogs so slowly through her error-filled powerpoints (which I guess have been improved, maybe?), there's no point in ever showing up. It's good to be able to learn from other resources like 2x speed videos like Vigoda's Algos lectures and /u/HFh and Michael Littman's Udacity videos.

* The only CS class I've had that's really on a curve so far was ML. None of my classes have felt competitive, and ones without active piazzas felt like people were just not thinking/caring about others.

* Apartment-style dorms are nice as long as you're in the majority that are renovated, but have jack shit in terms of community. I don't see this changing.

* After taking classes at UNT, I think our food and housing is mediocre, but not bad, but also very overpriced. People complain too much.

comments,"&gt;No amount of resources the institute gives you will change your mental state.

I can personally attest that this is not true. During my fourth year at Tech, I was able to see a counselor, provided by the institute, who with the help of CBT and some group exercises was able to change my mental state from one of paranoia and social anxiety to a healthier state where I was much more relaxed and confident around my peers.

&gt;No amount of culture shift will make you feel better

I would certainly have felt better during my final semester if a certain AE professor had not felt able to spend half of a 90 minute lecture yelling at his students for failing to understand his badly written test and threatening to fail us all due to a culture that penalized such behavior.

&gt;You are in control

Fair point. Dan is now on Mars.

&gt;You are the one responsible for yourself. Taking care of your mental health is your responsibility.

It is also the responsibility of the institute to act in the best interests of the students by providing adequate resources for those who do try and improve their mental health:

&gt;It's your choice to get help. It's your choice to make friends. 

Both require the cooperation of external parties to succeed. Try to book a counseling appointment or make friends with me after writing this and see how far you get.

From what you’re saying, I assume the classes in the Fall require classes from the Summer? Is that what you mean? If so, this may be an advisor question. They can help you figure out if you need an override/whatever. 

My recommendation is to have the programs pretty independent of each other- so try to get classes that don’t overlap with prerequisites. Consider looking at what your major needs in terms of electives like a Technical Elective (for example, ChBE needs two Technical and Two Chem Electives).

I’m not sure, but I believe class registration goes through the exchange university and not our system. If you do need a prerequisite you’re taking in the summer, I bet you could work that out with the program/university. ",positive,0.8755,neutral,-0.046875,12/06/2018

When my dad was doing his PhD, his lab mostly consisted of other Chinese grad students.

You base the validity of something on its popularity? Ever hear of phrenology? How about eugenics? I imagine you're probably a huge fan of sociology, aren't you? 

&gt; People are arguing that if you want help, you can't even reasonably find it here in the first place. 

I don't know if I'd agree with that, never really dealt with the counseling center. I've seen multiple people make the claim that their experience with it was actually extremely positive though, so the anecdotal evidence of those who claim it to be supremely negative strikes me as a group of people who fall into the exact category that OP is aiming his discussion at. 

&gt; Which, if you connect the dots, means you're probably a bad person

Why am I a bad person for generally looking out for my own needs before helping other people; haven't you ever listened to an airplane safety video? I try to be kind to other people, certainly, but I'm slow to place expectations and reliance on them – that's called reasonable caution. What makes you feel that I owe you something, and that if I don't deliver, I am somehow lesser than you? From where do you derive your sense of entitlement? 

From an examination of your recent posts, it sounds like the unreasonable expectations you place on your fellow man have already kicked your ass once. Why aren't you open to the lessons that life is trying to teach you? Is your belief system so wafer-thin that it requires you to ignore the clear reality that is staring you right in the face?

&gt; judging from the upvotes

Is your argument truly so paper thin that you have to rely on an appeal to the masses to make your point?

You know the real difference. The Princeton endowment is $22B, which works out to $2.6M PER STUDENT. That's the largest per student endowment of any university in the country. Probably not the best source, but here's the first hit from google:

https://www.collegeraptor.com/college-rankings/details/EndowmentPerStudent

In contrast, our total endowment is $1.8B, which works out to something in the ballpark of $120k per student. That's a 20x difference.

Assuming 5% return (which is in the ballpark of what is often spent out of endowments), that's $130k per student per year at Princeton of money to support the educational mission compared to $6k per student per year at GT.

Dont take your inspirational motivation from Reddit. Look outside instead. The real world is a lot happier than what you find here on the internet.

Reddit is here to vent stress. Arguments are a common form of venting. Some, probably most, can be viewed as negative. If one could harness the energy of the collective stress produced on a college campus during Finals week, we'll probably cure cancer and establish world peace.

In Reddit terms, if I were to take a step back, I would argue that /r/GaTech is simply circlejerking in the negativity. We certainly aren't getting a collective laugh out of it and the topics being addressed are serious issues but by posting negativity, the poster feels happier.

I name it the *Conservation of Happiness* where by the act of voicing one's concerns and letting off one's negativity out into the world reduces the internal negativity of said person, thus making said person ""happier"" by relative positive/negative balance.

That being said, the release of negative feelings is much like the toxic waste of any industrial process. It's a lot easier to simply dump it into the local stream (i.e. Reddit) than to filter, clean, and process it before releasing it into the environment.

Anyone not knowing of the contaminants of the stream before drinking from it will ingest the negativity and therefore become more negative.

Yes, one way to clean up the stream is having a metaphorical EPA come in and force factories upstream to clean up their act and stop dumping directly into the stream but the Government in this case are the Moderator team and I'll bet my theoretical degree in physics that they wont do anything.

That means if you wanna take a dip into the stream, suit up in your hazmat suit before hand or take a walk outside before your negativity dose gets above industry established maximum safety values.",negative,-0.9863,positive,0.07972582972582971,12/06/2018

For the millionth time, that is not why Scout got shot.

Guns had **nothing** to do with it, besides putting the police showing up on high alert and increasing the sense of tension they certainly felt.

comments,"&gt;No offense, I'm sure you care about students, but in my 3.5 years at Tech, I felt the exact opposite. I felt like the majority of my professors couldn't care less about my well being, or for that matter, my success in life.

So the funny thing is I was actually having a conversation with another faculty member about this topic today. Here's the weird thing, there is a strong correlation between students perceiving faculty as caring and better learning outcomes - but there is little/no correlation between faculty actually caring about students and better learning outcomes. That sounds crazy until you think about the implication...

Basically, what we have isn't a caring problem...we have a communicating caring problem. Students don't feel like we care, and in the end that is a failure on our part. That is our responsibility. However, it is also something that has become a narrative in the GT culture. In the end that means the default assumption is faculty don't care so we have to try EXTRA hard to build trust that we really do care, we aren't faking it. You see that in some of the nihilism and sarcasm related to open door day and other things - students, as a self-care/defense mechanism, don't want to give it much credibility because they feel like they have been burned by trusting the admin to actually care/continue to show caring so many times before.

The funny thing is I can think of at least two professor who would break your mind. One could not care less about students, but is a strong enough educator that his students believe, and act, as if he cares. He can communicate caring because he knows its part of doing his job well...but really he just wants to do research. On the flip side I know another faculty member who cares deeply about his students, and is TERRIBLE at showing it...partially it's cultural. The students sincerely believe he doesn't care and aren't going to be convinced otherwise. It all comes down to how we communicate.  

Which of those do you want to experience? How do we get the first to actually care? how do we get the second to communicate/care more effectively? Overall...how do we change people? Its fucking hard.

comments,"&gt;I know it feels like you're paying a lot for tuition (because you are). I have paid it and am saving to pay it for my kids now. But at a place like this, the research funding is a fundamental part of the budget model. If I remember right, I think something like 30%+ of our income is from ""sponsored research"", which is more than tuition or state funding (which are both in the ballpark of 20% I think). That money pays for real things, including facilities and people that are valuable to you. For example, professors pay (depending on department and seniority) anywhere from 25-75% of their own salary off of grants because the tuition/state money alone isn't nearly enough to cover it. If the research goes away, we couldn't pay for many of the people teaching your classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe the number last year was over $900 million in research expenditures at GT.

&amp;#x200B;

Overheard\* on those grants was 11% of the GT budget last year

Tuition was 22% 

State funding was 18%

\*Overhead is a fee that GT charges anyone who gets a grant to pay for things like power, janitorial services, IT, etc...basically all the basic stuff you need to run a college that does research.

I promise this is meant as teasing not as sarcasm...imagine that. You hire people based on their ability to do a job and you end up with people better at it than when you hire people based on their ability to be excellent at somethign else.

Less tongue in cheek...part of the increase in lecturers, academic professionals, and professors of practice among other roles are because of a focus on making undergraduate courses better. They are hired based on their ability to teach well (or at least are supposed to be). They are paid to focus on teaching. It shouldn't be surprising they are better at it. In a way, I actually think it is a little unfair to really blast tenure track professors for poor teaching ability.

In response to point 3: I'm a CS major, and many of the problems I encounter are ""one right answer"" problems.

Solving math problems with a group of people has formed the strongest and funnest friendships I've ever had. Therefore, I think finding a community of people that pushed me intellectually has helped me form a support system mentally as well. I would conjecture that your point 3 generalizes to any subject in which one can (or is lucky enough) to find friends to team up with to solve problems. 

Perhaps this might be more difficult in some majors than other though... I have no insight about that question.

comments,"I've noticed you're consistently trying to twist my words; I've said that you can't rely on many people, and that you should look to ensure you own security before helping others, not that you should actively be malevolent against others. For instance, if my own career is in jeopardy, I am not going to be spend time worrying about yours. If it is you or me on the chopping block, it's not gonna be me (excepting close friends, where I trust them enough to work towards a third option). There is nothing inherently wrong with serving your own self-interests, until malevolence and greed enter the picture. You cannot  always give and expect to remain emotionally healthy; if you let people walk all over you, you will grow to despise yourself. A certain amount of selfishness is necessary for a healthy ego; too much, and you become an out-of-balance narcissist – too little, an out-of-balance doormat.

So I suppose that if you are seeking to be absolutely, truly selfless, then I am selfish. So be it, but I'd rather be a balanced, healthy individual than a man who constantly allows people to take advantage of me, using me until I'm all washed up. 

&gt; Clearly you have little desire, if any, to give anyone anything, so I don't expect anything from you.

For one, that is a lot to suppose about someone whom you do not know; I am quite generous towards my friends, and welcoming towards strangers. That said, I'm not going to blindly trust people or expect humanity as a whole to move towards some ridiculously harmonious pow-wow. My experience has been that people are generally nice to people they know personally, but suspicious and demeaning to those they do not – you are proving that point quite handily, by supposing that I am ""a bad person"", based solely off a few conversations over Reddit and your own preconceived notions of who I must be. 

&gt; Life is social, and I give to people to the best of my ability.

Would you give to me if I asked or demanded your assistance? How far does your altruism go? Will you allow me, a complete stranger from the internet whom you do not seem to like terribly well, to crash on your couch for weeks on end? 

&gt; I want to see our culture change to something more positive

To me, it sounds as though your first job was not a healthy experience; you expected that people would be kind to you, and instead, they used you up to point of a mental break. That's a wake-up call to be more assertive and treat yourself with more self-worth. It does sound like you finally came around, so good for you; but nevertheless, if you still believe in allowing people to use you, then have you really learned your lesson? 

Furthermore, it is incredibly naive of you to think that you can change the fundamental elements of human nature; our desire to see to our own needs first is born of billions of years of natural selection – we are all products of that. We can no more escape our nature than an ant can decide it is an individual; certainly, I believe that we are free, but our freedom is limited by our perspective. Whether you like it or not, that innate desire to further your own self-interest is instinctual and just as much a part of you as your fingers are. Perhaps you think that by publicly signalling your virtue on the Internet that you can further that self-interest and increase your social worth; given the kinds of circles you seem to run with, it wouldn't surprise if much of your social worth **is** based on how well you ""ownd that online fascist!!1!"". Regardless, the instinct to advance self-interest is an innate one, and you will gain far more from acknowledging your nature and seeking to work with it rather than blithely denying its existence. Denial only makes emotions stronger, as may or may not be evident to you by now; as an aside, I wonder whether this is why you are so driven to paint so many as selfish, because you fear that you yourself are? Only you know the answer to that question, and I doubt you'll be willing to truly think about it. Enjoyed the chat.

People struggle with balancing their social and work life everywhere and more-so here. Everyone needs to take initiative and everyone needs to grow, but as a bunch of nerds we’ll put our grades and accomplishments before making time to meet people...because often we don’t know any better. 

I find the sentiment that GT students are only looking to blame others for their mental illness repulsive. The students are pushed to their maximum and the help that’s advertised to them is subpar. The services at GT are rubbed in everyone’s face when tragedy hits, but when students try to get help they hardly get any. 

GT is a rough school and more than often the overworking, stressing and difficulty is glorified. I’ve seen it too often that it’s treated with a sense of pride, that our suffering is a sign of strength even when it kills us inside. It’s a culture, and I know that not just science students, but ID students experience it too. 

To sum up: People think suffering at GT is normal and the way to go. Those who suffer most efficiently are glorified. Less social students are even more vulnerable to this. GT, though you can argue doesn’t owe you help, still decides to advertise its services on full only to disappoint those who seek it. ",positive,0.5892,neutral,0.04285714285714286,12/07/2018

You can’t even begin to imagine the choices the police officer was forced to make when an obviously insane individual,who purportedly had a gun on him, starts advancing. Would you rather the cop have died? And before you pull some “shoulda used a taser” shit on me, tasers are relatively inconsistent, and very limited in range and reloadability. So, if Scout did have a gun and was in fact aggressive (as the call suggested) a missed taser shot = a dead cop. Literally not worth the risk in any universe.

The way I see it we have two cases:

Case 1 : Officer attempts to use taser
97% chance the cop survives, 100% chance Scout survives (this encounter atleast)

Case 2: Officer uses a pistol
100% chance the cop survives, 1% chance Scout survives

The life of an actively aggressive suspect is in NO WAY worth the 3% chance of the cop’s death. The cop did absolutely nothing wrong leading up to this encounter, so why should his life be on the line.

That $10k price tier is typically reserved for USAF toilet seats and such, and I doubt as much engineering went into that particular bench.

I think I might have sat on one of those benches a grand total of twice during my stay at GT; I never once stood up from one and thought, ""Boy!  I feel much better now!"" either.

&gt;the dedication

$0

&gt;the bench itself

$200?  It's just some wood, steel, hardware and a plaque cut from a premade pattern, right?

&gt;the installation

so maybe another $300 for concrete and labor if we assume worst case scenario and the site has to be prepped?

I'm not a physiologist/psychologist/brain scientist, so this explanation might be off, but the point isn't. The point of eschewing electronics while exercising is so your brain can subconsciously process things, which distractions like electronics inhibit.  A few years ago, there was an obit of a famous physicist who made ""discoveries"" while doing manual labor, and this was used as an example of this.  His personal technique was to go into his basement with nothing but a shovel and a light and move a pile of dirt from one side of the basement to the other, and while preoccupied with the task, his brain would be working in the background and realizations would all of a sudden pop up.

The BMED classes on the other hand are far more in depth, which a focus on topics that are more useful to pre-health student. Both are physiology classes in that they focus less on structure (anatomy) and more on function of systems in the body. 3100 is the physiology of macroscopic features in the body like tissues, organs, and organ systems, while 3600 focuses on microscopic features like the internal workings of cells.

Both classes are fun and contain an interesting-open ended group project, but the overall difficulty (and IMO usefulness) of the classes can vary wildly between professors. I can't speak much to different professors for 3100 but I would highly recommend taking 3600 with Prof. Dahlman over Santangello or Platt.

Even equating the two is a hard, hard overreach. If there was a random person making $60k sitting at home that could step in, be competitive (win games) and keep his nose clean (program integrity) then these coaches wouldn't be getting $3MM+. Look at Saban. He brings way more money into the school than they could ever pay him, making him, relative to that important ROI context, underpaid.

&gt;I just don’t understand why the school is ok with paying one person that salary when that money could support more people. A bigger team of coaches &amp; strategists paid healthy 6 figure salaries which sum to the same amount seems to me like an advantage.

Unfortunately in college football (or any level really) that would not be a viable strategy. What would the Catholic Church do with 6 Popes? Or a large multinational firm with 6 CEOs? You want the one guy with the master plan who's going to affect his vision and run things his way. Saban at Alabama has the luxury of also having an army of 6 figure assistants and analysts, but Bama just has way more money. Even then we have a very robust staff. The head coach has his coordinators (offensive and defensive), but they're subordinate to him. They get paid big 6 figures and have a much narrower view but still have some say in the strategy. Then you have position coaches, who work with the players of the same position on personal technique and microlevel on-the-field work. So in a way the team has a bunch of people like you're imagining (even the position l coaches, who are the lowest level of coaches, make 6 figs) in coaching roles. Then you have grad assistants, who are volunteers that work with the team in organization that are not technically coaches. You have your strength and conditioning coach and staff that direct workouts and nutrition. You have your player development staff, that are part of the AA. You have your recruiting coordinators and staff who are constantly researching, evaluating and building relationships with potential players from all over the country. 

The football team leadership is like an army. And just like any well-functioning fighting machine, there's one field general calling the shots for the colonels, the captains, the majors, the infantry, etc. And that field general position is the head coach's job and his alone.

Edit: I'll add to this that college level coaches are truly some of the very best *football* coaches around, at any level. We're only seeing the absolute pinnacle when we tune in to CFB games on Saturdays. There are untold thousands and thousands of coaches who never even sniffed a small time college gig (GT is in the top of the top division of CFB). These guys are supremely talented. And there's just not enough of em to go around.",positive,0.9908,positive,0.16547619047619047,12/07/2018

comments,"Late response to this post but I figured more background couldn't hurt. This was funded through SGA's Joint Allocations Committee (JAC), which was created in direct response to Scout Shultz' death and allocates funds from the $1 million pot of money dedicated in Fall of 2017 ($500k from SGA, $500k from Tech Administration.) The policies governing JAC are found [here](http://jacketpages.gatech.edu/bills/view/2478), but briefly, there are 6 elected members (3 from UHR, 3 from GSS), 4 appointed members (2 by Grad SGA President, 2 by Undergrad President), and then the Grad and Undergrad Presidents themselves. We hear proposals from student groups and departments that further mental health on campus - anything over 10k goes to the Legislature for approval. Once JAC passes a proposal, the administration can choose to fund it or not from their side; if they decide not to, it can go to the Legislature for full funding. So in this case, SGA is allocating 5k.

[This proposal](http://jacketpages.gatech.edu/bills/view/2952) with reasoning was submitted by Pride Alliance. Everything JAC has heard before is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-tuVfcdRFU2JqxYfVN8nZP9M8YHgi2db/view). The cost is higher because it's a dedication though GT Development, which pays for the bench, upkeep over its lifetime, and allows a name to be attached to it. In every case, we aim to be consistent with what we fund. SGA approved the CRC's proposal for a permanent swing (purchase, installation), so capital outlay purchases are established by precedent. The committee agreed with the submitter that this would 1) formally recognize the tragedy of Scout's shooting, 2) soothe some of the pain still felt by many students on campus, and 3) still operate as a regular bench for students to sit and relax. To u/dobby_bodd's point, we did discuss the potential triggering effects of this bench, but also felt that it was important that we not forget the incident as it is still a driving force for change on campus (most significantly through Path Forward).

Any student can submit a proposal for funding for a mental health furthering initiative. The full process for how to do so is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lXTciS0um8yQxDRwbBInQHS-UfjZ2Xr7/view?usp=sharing), so if you have ideas for how to best spend this money, we really want to hear them.

As a general note, SGA very much could allocate funds to hire additional counselors, but we've heard emphatically that students don't want Student Activity Fee money spent on what should be an institute budgetary priority; also, it would only be a one-time purchase instead of recurring funding. We are currently pushing for that budgetary allocation and are exploring using JAC money to fund pilot programs for how to get counseling better integrated on campus.

While not required by the Clery Act, we also maintain a public log of non-criminal incidents to keep the community informed. We always strive to be open and transparent with our community, which is why we voluntarily elected to create and maintain a log of non-criminal incidents.
 
Reports taken related to mental health &amp; wellness are posted in the non-criminal log. A recent mental health related event was incorrectly reported on our crime log. While it is true that these entries were removed from the logs yesterday, they were only removed to resolve the reporting issue as it related to the privacy of those involved in these sensitive situations. We have resolved the issue and have reposted all of the non-crime incidents that were removed.
 
We want to remain sensitive to privacy concerns of those experiencing mental health issues. We also realize that transparency is critical during these times. It is not an easy balance to manage, and we are considering how to achieve this moving forward. 
 
We want to emphasize that mental illness is a medical condition, not a crime. Students who are experiencing a crisis should be able to reach out for assistance with confidence while maintaining confidentiality – and we will do our best to help.

comments,"Hot Take Riposte:

ID jobs are less stressful, all told, than production engineering jobs are, so there is less incentive within the ID program to acclimate ID students to high stress environments as a part of their educational training.

Elaboration:

If we deem it an objective goal to minimize the overall chance of suicide within an individual's life, then intentionally elevating stress within the 'safe space' of the academy to a certain reasonable limit, even possibly increasing the likelihood of suicide, may reduce the chances of a later suicide due to professional stress. If professional stress is less of an issue with ID grads than engineering grads, then there's less of a justification for elevating the stress within the ID program itself.

Discussion:

The ultimate question is whether the amount of stress within the engineering curriculum at Tech is justifiable. Any opinion on that question in absence of data is merely an opinion. I imagine an objective evaluation of this sort could be done statistically, were someone inclined to do so. It would probably take the following form:

1. Evaluate, perhaps through polls, the relative time obligations and stress levels of GT engineering students vs engineering students at other academies, using those other academies as a control group.
2. Evaluate the relative suicide rates of GT vs other academies. Control against two important confounders: gender and gun ownership. Compare to (1), to establish a correlation between academic stress and suicide rate.
3. Evaluate the relative suicide rates of GT vs other academies *post graduation*. Same confounder controls as in (2)
4. Make kewl graphs and shit.

I have no idea what the results of such an analysis would be, but I'd love to see it, were it done properly.

Personal admonition:

I went through suicidal phases in high school and a tiny bit as a freshman at GT. I would characterize the stress level of GT in my undergraduate program to be ""very high,"" probably the highest I've ever encountered anywhere. I didn't have any suicidal thoughts past the second year. When I entered the business world, I was continually taken aback by how much more easily I handled professional stress than my peers, and I've had coworkers comment on that. The easy response was always, ""yeah, this may be bad but at least this isn't Tech."" Never been suicidal since.

My school experience was in the 90s under a \~70% retention rate, so many of the people who didn't handle the stress well back then may have simply left or failed out, which may bias the pool of upperclassmen.

I do not know what ratio of my coworkers have ever been suicidal, nor do I have any experience with suicide in any of my workplaces, so I can't provide any useful anecdotes on that. And my own experience is merely an anecdote, not data.

* Bill calling on congress to pass gun control laws banning ""assault weapons""
* Bill calling on Georgia to legalize cannabis
* Removed funding for Marksmanship Club allegedly because of a leaked document saying that they faked some numbers in their request, but to my understanding this leaked document came from an SGA member and not from the club itself which is a little fishy (in the email regarding this, my representative said he did not feel that it was appropriate to fund this club in the first place)
* Rejected bill to fund an event about Israel, which would be one thing but they also didn't record this in their minutes anywhere or give a reason for why
* [Nate Knauf, one of the representatives for the CoC is a member of Democratic Socialists of America and is the one suing Perdue for the phone thing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/22/student-sues-sen-david-perdue-snatching-his-phone-when-he-asked-about-voting-rights/?utm_term=.b585b6c1820c)

comments,"&gt;With President Peterson’s annual salary of over $1,100,000

First off, this is a moot argument. As the president of a world class university, he holds an absolutely insane amount of responsibility and power. $1,100,000 is actually **much** lower than I expected. As a reference, the bottom 10% of publicly traded companies (most of which would be considerably smaller than GT in terms of revenue) paid their CEO's a salary of $878,000 on average as of 2011. ([Source](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/ilr.cornell.edu/files/workspan/02-11-Research-for-the-real-world_0.pdf)) The bottom 10%. There are a lot of very small companies in the bottom 10% of the stock market, so if anything Bud is being paid surprisingly little for his position, especially considering inflation since this article was written.

&gt;We must address that Georgia Tech’s curriculum is far more difficult and demanding than is necessary or reasonable.

Yep, thats the point. Ever wondered why we are #2 in Mechanical Engineering, #1 in Industrial Engineering, etc? You think you can just get a free pass to go to a stress free school and get one of the best possible undergraduate degrees awarded to anyone in America? That is just flat out ridiculous. This point is so overmade and is literally meaningless. School's aren't just ranked arbitrarily, the stressful curriculum of the school ensures that the best of students, both in academics and in ability to handle real work environments (stress), are awarded with a GT degree. Removing this aspect would render a GT degree much less prestigious.

&gt;Enfore Existing Reasonable Expectations for Coursework

I agree with most of the stuff you say here.

&gt; It is unreasonable to expect students to individually take on the added labor of maintaining their mental and emotional well-being when there are more time-sensitive needs to address.

Possibly the dumbest sentence in the entire letter. It is literally your body. Regardless of who's fault it is that you are mentally unstable, it is your sole responsibility to find the help you need. It's like saying ""It's not reasonable that y'all expect me to feed myself while going here."" (i.e. taking care of your physical wellbeing)

&gt; These conditions are not sustainable-- we cannot be expected to succeed if we are not fully supported as growing students and maturing adults.

Just a side note, its really weird that somehow these conditions are not sustainable, and yet probably 95% of students sustain themselves just fine and love the school.

&gt;Develop a contractual relationship between The Office of the Dean of Students and a mental healthcare facility to admit students for a flat fee paid by the institute for all involuntary and voluntary mental health hospitalizations.

Great point, well substantiated. Definitely the best part of the letter.

&gt;Eliminate all fees for Psychiatry appointments.

Yeah, also a decent point (given this is actually true)",positive,0.9906,positive,0.09158496732026142,12/07/2018

comments,"I know im going to sound like an ass here but hearing this ""you guys are more important than your GPA"" over and over again can be detrimental.

Dont get me wrong, im sure many do and need to appreciate the gesture. But it teaches people to be complacent about their GPA and leads to a self fulfilling prophecy which goes on loop every semester, depression towards final weeks etc. Nothing ends up changing. 

To truly solve the problem lies at the heart of oneself, and I believe telling people that having a low GPA is okay is something that actually leads to self-degradation ""i cant be like that guy or girl no matter how hard i try so i should just let things be the way they are"".

 A lot of stifled potential comes with too much assurance and a lot of mental duress comes with too much pushing. 

At the end of the day, everyone is different and needs different solution. What i want to say tho is that this trend happens all too often, and for people to be truly happy about themselves they shouldnt have to be reminded everything is going to be alright every semester.

I personally had a low gpa and I couldnt learn to accept the fact that I had to be told having a low gpa was okay. It was so selfdegrading eevery semester, hence why Im posting this for those that feel the same way. 

Regardless, im sure many students appreciate this kind of gesture and I thank all who genuinely want to help others. It still means something at the end of the day. Just dont overdo it",positive,0.9794,positive,0.20771604938271604,12/07/2018

comments,"You can either choose your teammates (usually up to five people on a team) or work with random people. AFAIK, you can’t change the team after they are assigned.

Although there are some individual milestones, most of them are team milestones that count for a chunk of your grade so if you have a bad team, you might have to carry them.

If your milestone grades are bad, you could get up to 50% extra on your grade with ec at the end of the year (and destroy your teammates on the peer evals), so you would be fine.

That being said, this is Waters’s last semester teaching so the format might be different for you.

comments,"You attribute a great deal of hurtful things to me, with absolutely nothing to back them up. As far as I know, I don't know you at all in real life, nor have we interacted much on this subreddit. What ridiculous propaganda have you swallowed, to pretend to know someone with whom you have never once met in any other setting than an online forum? 

Tell me, what are my ""real intentions""? What ridiculous malevolence have you ascribed to me, conjured from the dark places of your id? It genuinely makes me feel sorry for you, to see a person so filled with hatred for one they know only through minuscule amounts of Internet banter. Is your life truly that empty and joyless?

Anyways, the idea that I could ever ""commandeer"" this subreddit is a patently ridiculous one; even if the folks running the place were to offer me a position of moderator, I would barely have any power whatsoever; don't you know that the most recent mods are those who have the least power in a subreddit?

comments,"I don’t have time for the survey but if there’s a chance of taking some feedback here, I’m copying in elements of an old letter some friends and I wrote about campus changes.
     

The most important change that needs to happen to prevent more students from taking their own lives is to change the structure of the campus to increase student efficacy. Right now, most students hate it here. The feeling is that our work, our ideas, and who we are as individuals are completely insignificant to the school. We have no power, we are not heard, we are not empowered  to do what it is that we seek to do. 
     
1) why is there no gym, no place for physical exercise, in the heart of campus? There should be something where the student center is. GT is one of the only schools in the ACC that *doesn’t* have a fitness complex in the center of campus.      
      
2) Raise pay for TAs/RAs. It’s too expensive to build more full-fledged counseling facilities. Why not just raise everyone’s wages by $250/month so we can afford to pursue private care off-campus?    
    
3) Stop wasting money on things that don’t matter, like half of the new student union plans... why do we have huge cultural facilities but no general market to buy things like... you know... fresh fruit, vegetables, a place to have a choice (not just one) toothpaste, lots of school supplies, etc.   
    
4) Stop making us walk off campus to buy books. Yeah, I know we all just download the books anyway, but it’s really annoying that the campus “bookstore” is in tech square.     
     
5) Can we stop pretending that the faculty-student relationships here are okay?      
     
6) Add better-quality furniture, cover everything in whiteboards, the campus is currently 90% form and 10% function, if not even worse than that. Seriously. Most of the recently-built structures feel like ergonomically designed paperweights: expensive, serves limited purpose, pretty, and pretty useless.      
       
7) Increase the amount of money available for performance awards, for graduate and undergraduate research awards, by 25%.

Some people probably tend to become a CS major because they like computers/video games and want to make a lot of money, not necessarily because they have a passion for the material/work. In any challenging technical field, this is probably not the best idea. This may lead to resentment among some of the people in that category.

Furthermore, there are definitely complaints people have about CS, but the incredibly high job placement and pay mean you're not as likely to see many go out of their way to voice them.",positive,0.3847,positive,0.2161538461538462,12/08/2018

comments,"I appreciate the time you've taken to put together these thoughts, but I kind of disagree with them, especially in the context of changing campus culture.

1) The reason is because we have the big fancy CRC from the Olympics, and we don't really need another one? The student center is just that -- there's plenty of ways for students to gather and interact there. There's also Tech Green, where people are out playing frisbee or other games all the time. I don't think a fitness center is really necessary there.

2) I mean, sure, I'm a TA and more money would be neat, but that affects such a tiny percentage of the campus that it really would not make a difference.

3) Because we're in the middle of one of the biggest cities in the Southeast, so you can walk off campus in any direction and find those things at a store. I'd be kind of annoyed if new student center space was leased out to Walmart or something instead of something for the students. Fresh food would be nice, but just go to Publix.

4) Most people go to Barnes and Noble once a semester, max. And Tech Square \*is\* campus, officially. I don't think the business students think all their classes are off campus.

5) If you mean that there's a toxic amount of competition/grade problems/etc, then yeah, I agree.

6) I'm really not seeing how this affects campus culture in the slightest. My classes are literally in an old bank vault and we somehow make do. 

7) Again, I'm confused how this affects culture but regardless this affects very few students and doesn't significantly affect culture.

Put practice problems on your crib sheets instead of just information. Most of the problems on the final are the same with numbers changed. If you pick problems that you struggle on, odds are you'll a similar problem on the final and get it right the second time. If you're scared you're going to run out of room, use mechanical pencil and write small!

I don't know how much time you have, but actually skim the text book and make a one-pager for each chapter. Those will help you learn the more concept-based questions than the math problems

I want to refute a few of the rebuttles if I may.     
Specifically, starting with the additional money per month. Yes, it looks small, but no, it's not actually small. $250/month is on the low end of fees for private therapists that are any good. However, on the margin, I dare say the average tech student couldn't scrounge up $250-350/month for services. 
    
How does this affect campus culture: the more people are taking positive steps for their mental health, the more openly people will talk about things on campus. That will change stigmas about mental health over time where it matters most: classes and labs. I personally know people who have turned down ODS accommodation letters out of fear of retribution alone.

Regarding the CRC: the niceness of the building doesn't compensate for it's proximity to campus. Ive had bone cancer, it's not easy for me to walk across campus to the CRC, but I have to use weights (etc) for strength training. 
Open fields are not a valid point of comparison for a gym given the two serve different purposes (and some of the same). 

Most of us don't have time to go to Publix during the day. Not grad students anyway. Replace inefficient fast food with good food please. And for the sake of all that is good in this world, please don't let Walmart near campus. 
Can someone hit up trader Joe's about making a mini shop for us? That would be fire.    
     
Regarding the space: for the relative size of our endowment, the number of students, and the fact we are supposed to be a ""cutting edge R1 institution"", having classes where you ""make due"" isn't okay. I challenge your level of status quo bias here. Just because something works doesn't mean it can't be made better.

comments,"I was someone who was sucked into the CS hype my freshman year. I'm less interested in CS now, but am still graduating with the major along with my preferred major, Industrial Engineering. 

I still have a good appreciation for CS and enjoy using the things I've learned in the curriculum to supplement my work in ISYE, but I left it for my primary major for a couple of reasons. 

Majoring in CS is kind of like a greedy search algorithm. Insanely high payoff for little work early on, since you can just study a few coding problems online and find high-paying internships (around 2x, 3x pay than other majors) and high-paying jobs (1.5x pay than most other starting salaries). This is in addition to the clout of working for companies like Google, Facebook with a large media presence, where large companies in other fields largely stay out of the public eye. I'm not arguing clout is something worth chasing, but it is attractive nevertheless. Also, pay isn't everything, and I realized this pretty early on in my first internship when I was damned to front-end UI hell. The work wasn't intellectually interesting, and really repetitive. Even if pay was everything (it isn't), the pay eventually levels off as you grow in your career and I hear, though I don't have real numbers to support this, that business/management-focused majors outpace the salary of software engineers a couple years in. 

Some pros of not majoring in CS:

 - You might be more unique in your social circle for doing something different. This is a weak pro, but I kind of like it. 

 - You're largely removed from the toxicity that is CS recruiting. It largely luck-of-the-draw, but lots of people treat it like the company you work for defines who you are. 

 - CS is largely open-source in terms of learning and resources, meaning it's one of the easiest majors to learn about without spending your tuition. I can make no guarantees about your ability to self-teach. 

 - Maybe you would be interested in something else. 

Cons:

 - Lower starting salary

 - Weak con depending on the person, but you have less options to be in large cities post-graduation. Business majors might be excluded from this, but I know some majors are forced to look for jobs in obscure cities, whereas CS majors really can choose anywhere from SF, NY, Boston, etc. 

 - If you can't self-teach, you'll never learn this incredibly valuable skill that is becoming increasingly prevalent. ",positive,0.8875,positive,0.16551020408163267,12/09/2018

If you want to dip out of CS, you absolutely can. There is ZERO shame in it. Staring at code all day is not for everyone. Check out jobs at tech companies focused on recruiting or some other administrative role. Find a company that will pay for your MBA and build yourself up from there.

comments,"So, manufacturing companies generally have more wiggle room with GPA. Especially if you meet recruiters face to face at job fairs.  Sure, it is not as glamorous as being in a research lab, but can be challenging and rewarding work. I co-oped and then went full time into the paper industry. I'm only 3 years out of school, and I've lived in Richmond, Dallas, and now Charleston. I did research while at Tech as well, but I find this work far more satisfying. The dress code is really easy: jeans and tee shirts. I routinely get so dirty at work that I have to shower and change before I can leave. But the part I like best is sitting in the control room with a cup of coffee with the operators on a Monday morning talking about Saturday's football games. Like, here I am 2AM on a Sunday night at work browsing Reddit, drinking coffee, and talking about local news with two operators. We are in a boiler annual outage, and I got to be the night supervisor. :)  


So, a bit of a ramble to say try looking into companies like Dow, International Paper, WestRock, Arkema, etc. Some of them will have the high GPA  requirements, but some will not.

Things that my manager has gone on record saying is that he looks for people who accept getting down and dirty at work (i.e. having some experience in service industry or in a dirty research lab) and demonstrate the ability to interact with operators (i.e. having customer service experience/club leadership abilities).

Keep your head up. While realistically, it may be difficult getting your gpa above a 3.0, there are other things you can improve to make sure you have a fighting chance.

comments,"Sorry in the delay on some additional explanation.

1. We should have been a bit more specific in that this is solely for the chance of black ice- not for snow/freezing rain/sleet.  

2. Others are correct that the residual wet roads and some runoff may be present when the surface temps fall below freezing.

3.  The temps should not fall below freezing tonight until 3-4AM and even then it will only last through 8AM. We're confident that midnight breakfast should be fine.

4. Although the dew point temperatures should fall quickly tonight, we don't have as much wind as we typically do on the backside of these lows, so it remains to be seen how much drying will take place before it can freeze.  This light rain/drizzle should end by 11PM.

5.  Overall, this is not on the same scale as other weather threats in the past.  The area will probably see some icy patches and folks traveling in the morning should take extra precautions and allow more time. 

6. Without an exam period in the morning tomorrow, it made sense to go ahead and delay the opening in case conditions do deteriorate.  Regardless, as soon as the sun starts shining in the morning, everything will improve.

7. Impacts to campus operations and services are being compiled and pasted to the main website at www.gatech.edu.

Finally, we're considering doing an AMA on campus closures, especially with regard to winter weather.  Please let us know if you'd be interested and provide suggestions for subjects to cover.

We'll be on campus early tomorrow AM checking roadways and pasting updates to twitter.com/gtpdalerts.

Most of us students already have issues with procrastination and motivation when we have time specifically blocked out to go to lecture. Having it all online and learning on your own would imo just ruin motivation even more, and the comments I’ve read seem to confirm that.

Not to mention the fact that you’re losing immediate access to the professor for questions you may have. If this style appeals to you maybe you should go for an online degree, but we came here and are paying for the priviledge to get an in-person education.",negative,-0.4736,positive,0.18923076923076923,12/10/2018

Most people (myself included) would end up putting off the whole week's lectures until the day homework was due, at which point we'd cram the lecture recording while having MML in split screen.

Don't get me wrong, it feels great having that kind of flexibility, but it has drawbacks.

Meanwhile, other courses like ECE 3710 and ISYE 3025 have less interesting videos, not enough worked out and thoroughly explained examples, and just aren’t as great quality.

comments,"I agree with some, I had posted lectures for my morning Dynamics class (summer semester as well so 2 hour long lectures) and usually I just wouldn't show up. Watching them and trying to catch up would inevitably take way longer than it would have been to just go to class in the first place because my attention span, especially at home, is terrible and of course I'd procrastinate so I'd end up having 12 hours or more of lectures to watch right before an exam. Not a recipe for success. Now it might work better for other students but I'd personally say I didn't care for it.

I also think the logistics of recording every lecture would be pretty insane. You have to have a videographer there controlling to camera as the professor moves along the board and in many cases, switches to the projector throughout. That's a lot of people you're going to have to employ plus most of the classrooms on campus just aren't setup for it.

comments,"In order for teaching to be most effective, it needs to be dynamic, while recorded lecture are static. Good teaching relies on a feedback loop, more questions slows it down to get more detail and less questions means less detail. If you record a lecture, you have to anticipate the amount of detail needed.

as a student, I'm allowed to record lectures (through ODS), and it helps with the fact lectures are not good for me as a learning style. So I do understand the argument.

But in general, recorded lectures cause less students causes less interaction causes less feedback and thus less effective lectures. ",positive,0.8352,positive,0.14379084967320263,12/11/2018

comments,"Finishing up the third rotation of co-op here. I'll answer your questions based on my own experiences.

1. For a first rotation, you should have it verified before your waiver. That said, when you say verified, do you mean like you don't have an offer letter? In which case, I recommend calling/emailing your respective HR to ensure that's in place soon. I'm confused, because if they told you they were accpeting you as a co-op, they would need to give you an offer letter, which is all you need. At the very least, you should have an email/letter saying that they accepted you, and that hire-on paper work was on the way.
2. As far as I know, you should be okay here. As long as you have an offer letter and get the slip signed, you won't get penalized. I believe this applies to phase 2 as well, but if you want to avoid taking the risk, definitely get into contact with HR/your hiring manager.
3. I've registered my co-op phase 2, but it also wasn't my first rotation. It most likely depends on your advisor, but if you know it's a gauranteed position, I wouldn't worry too much about phase 1 or phase 2 stuff.

Again, I can't stress enough how important it is to **contact your company's HR.** If emails aren't cutting it, call them. They need to know the urgency of the situation. Additionally, **explain this to your co-op advisor** to make sure it gets figured out. I know you're stressed out, especially with finals, but try and remain calm and work on making sure that everyone involved here is updated with information and how urgent this is to you.",positive,0.966,positive,0.10670454545454545,12/11/2018

**Linear algebra** is the branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) concerning [linear equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_equation) such as

{\\displaystyle a\_{1}x\_{1}+\\cdots +a\_{n}x\_{n}=b,}📷

[linear functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map) such as

{\\displaystyle (x\_{1},\\ldots ,x\_{n})\\mapsto a\_{1}x\_{1}+\\ldots +a\_{n}x\_{n},}📷

and their representations through [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)) and [vector spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra#cite_note-3)

Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics. For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of [geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry), including for defining basic objects such as [lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(geometry)), [planes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(geometry)) and [rotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_(mathematics)). Also, [functional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_analysis) may be basically viewed as the application of linear algebra to spaces of functions. Linear algebra is also used in most sciences and [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) areas, because it allows [modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) many natural phenomena, and efficiently computing with such models. For [nonlinear systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system), which cannot be modeled with linear algebra, linear algebra is often used as a first-order approximation.

Inspired by the verifiable nature of blockchain technology, I'm proud to unveil Going Outside And Trying it Yourself, or GOATY. With GOATY, consumers can quickly and easily determine whether they can walk between two buildings in time.

This groundbreaking new product doesn't even require an Internet connection. Through the power of Your Own Fucking Legs (YOFL) technology, you'll be able to streamline the process, skipping posting on /r/gatech entirely and with guaranteed 100% accuracy.

This kind of innovation is only possible with the power of the Gech Cloud™, which will offer you shade unlike any other during the hot summer months of the beginning of the Fall semester. And unlike other clouds like AWS, the Gech Cloud is powered by renewable solar energy.

We're pleased to announce that GOATY, powered by YOFL and the Gech Cloud, is available starting today for just $0.",positive,0.9746,positive,0.24776334776334777,12/11/2018

Overall Georgia Tech culture is kind of a mixed bag. On one hand, we have a complainer culture due to abysmal student services (transportation &amp; dining). On the other hand, I've met some truly incredible people doing really cool things. People *generally* take classes and academics pretty seriously. 

As for class sizes, again, take my experience with a grain of salt as I'm taking mostly intro-ish level courses (CS 1332 data structures, Calc 2, English 2, etc). I've found class sizes to not be a huge issues. Lectures are pretty big but my professors are still responsive to student questions and generally gauge the room. Recitations are usually much smaller with less than 20 students. As for the bell curve grading, I haven't had it happen to me, but I do hear it happens, especially with the upper level courses. 

The biggest benefits of coming here will be the amazing people you meet, and also the career opportunities. Lots of companies recruit heavily from Georgia Tech, especially for CS.

comments,"Honestly, the flipped classroom debate depends on the class. Most if not all of BME classes are ""flipped"" in some manner, but what we do (and what should be done to make it successful) is have a problem-based learning, or PBL, session. These are sessions where you go in and work in small groups to do problem sets with the help of roaming TA's and professors. It's similar to recitation, but more in-depth and for longer periods of time. We still have lectures, but usually, just one or two during the week and in many classes video or audio recordings are uploaded. 

I've also had an amazing experience in a flipped statics class. The videos were all on coursera and all we did in class was work on homework and ask questions as needed. If you didn't watch the videos at home, you could do so in class and ask questions about them. 

However, I personally have had an awful experience with the Circuits flipped class. The video learning style is fine, but having quizzes at the beginning of every class, before any TA or professor has even gone over the material or anyone has had the opportunity to ask questions was difficult. In addition, our TA didn't really care and we didn't have access to a professor for the entire class. It wasn't until the CIOS that I even learned we had one.

But the gist of it is: Flipped classroom and partially flipped classroom learning is a great tool, but not if there isn't any accountability for the students. Students, especially the 1st and 2nd years that would be taking linear algebra as you mentioned, have a tendency to procrastinate and then be upset when they can't get everything done. It is amazing at helping learn the material, if you actually participate completely. I do however think that linear algebra should have a recitation, as it didn't when I was taking the class, so I never learned if I did the problems correctly until graded homework. 

TLDR; it really depends on how the class is structured, how good the video or lecture learning elements are, and how good the TA is. ",positive,0.9551,positive,0.2026666666666667,12/12/2018

I'd recommend it if you've had interest in CS for a long time and at least have some good experience with algorithmic stuff (hackerrank, leetcode, projecteuler, etc). Also it's a much easier major for people who learn on their own. The lectures are pretty meh to outright bad sometimes, so you have a huge leg up if you can teach yourself new material on your own with persistence.

&amp;#x200B;

The one super awesome thing about CS is the internships if you take advantage of them early on. If you're really proactive and do a lot of research into what makes a good software resume, you can make great money at comfy jobs starting freshman summer.

comments,"I'm probably not the best person to respond since even my masters is now two years old and this is very much an undergrad specific question, but I still have close ties to the Institute.  GT's culture is ... interesting.  The best reference I have found on GT culture is actually this derogatory article from a Clemson fan page: [https://www.shakinthesouthland.com/2018/9/21/17883408/georgia-tech-love](https://www.shakinthesouthland.com/2018/9/21/17883408/georgia-tech-love)  Honestly the only issue I take is his assertion that GT lacks school spirit.  A huge percentage of GT students think of football as something that screws up traffic when they're trying to get to class, but I know of few schools where students are as proud of their school academically as GT.  The average GT student complains about how horrible it is, but they're unshakably convinced that they're better than you because they're at GT and the only reason you're not is you couldn't make it.

&amp;#x200B;

On the minus side, the complaints about student services probably aren't misplaced.  Most of the dorms were old when I was an undergrad twenty years ago.  The food is mediocre at best.  Professors are consumed by their research and classes can feel too large, especially in the core and intro classes.

&amp;#x200B;

On the plus side, the professors are frequently on the cutting edge.  The GT CS program is very highly ranked and I frequently talk to large companies who located offices in midtown to make recruiting GT grads easier.  At the grad school level students are collaborative.  That was true at undergrad when I was one, but that was forever ago.  For both class size and classes with high failure rates it's much worse in the 1000/2000 level classes than the 3000/4000 level, so transferring in misses a lot of it.

comments,"Gay (South) Asian here. Currently have a white boyfriend. He's amazing and I'm glad I found him ☺️. We have a lot in common and we look past each other's races and love each other's personalities.

Gatech is very interesting in regards to the race situation. So like people everywhere, people are racist. It happens, and it's terrible. Constantly on gay dating apps, you'll see ""no asians, no femmes, masc for masc"" and it's on the borderline of discrimination (types are real, but the line for racism vs types is blurred imo). Gays in general think they can do this because they are already discriminated against.

The poc in the gay community can act the same way, only preferring white people. So if you're asking this question because you want to know if you can snatch a white boi, then who knows. Everyone is different and you might find one that likes you regardless of their race. But it goes both ways, you can't expect white boys to like your race and then you discriminate against your own race. You should own who you are and look past someone's skin color, you're only harming yourself and our fragile community.

But, if you're asking if the white gays are toxic and if they treat gays of other races badly, then you shouldn't worry, the gays on our campus are very nice.

It's finals season and I'm definitely feeling the grind, but it's not unreasonable for a top-tier college (I'm just a 2nd year tho, it might become harder for me later on 😬). The CS community is definitely more collaborative than competitive (this is one of my favorite things), save those one or two kids in lecture who try to one up everyone, as a result I don't really talk to them. There's a sense of ""we're all in this together"" and everyone's aware that everyone's super busy, no one's trying to pull fake shit to impress people by acting like everything's easy-peasy. Noticeable complainer culture, though some complaints are definitely justified (those regarding PTS/dining/freshman meal plan).

People are generally academically serious, especially in the compsci program, I think with regards to your problems with Clemson's academic culture, you'll find us quite refreshing.

The grading system that you described (everyone's getting shafted, then we wake up one day and we got curved to A's and B's) definitely happen with many classes (less common in lower level classes), not gonna lie. I'm taking machine learning right now and I'm getting absolutely shafted even when compared to the class medians, but this course is known to have generous curves and I'm hoping that'll carry me.

And it’s being live-streamed anyways so it’s not like it’s any harder to record for them. 

Other classes though that would take a lot of additional resources. Honestly though, with all the resources that you have like office hours / the textbook for 1554 at least you probably don’t need the lectures that bad anyways. ",negative,-0.6425,negative,-0.09837662337662335,12/12/2018

comments,"I'd just go through the collaborative study guide and try your best. Also, get some sleep because it is a lot of material and you certainly won't remember much on little sleep. If you look on course critique, it seems that there are many semesters where nobody gets a C let alone fails. With each assignment Professor Boots has increased the curve and I don't think the final will be an exception. The last time he taught the class almost 2/3 of the class got an A. Currently, based on the median scores on each assignment we can approximate the median grade of the class to be 89. Now, that would mean for 50% of the class to get an A the exam average would have to be above 93. The average on the midterm was an 84 after being curved 20 points. So, assuming similar performance on the final exam we could be looking at an even heftier curve. I wouldn't rely on it, but I would say there's hope for you.

comments,"I am a former GSU student, who transferred to GT on Fall 2018.

I would go with GSU, as its closer to GT and it will allow you to incorporate into the social life on campus (as you can go to big events) or simply come by and walk around campus for motivation.  

I don’t know how hard KSU is, but GSU is an easy school that’ll allow you to keep a high GPA to transfer over. Also, a lot of first/second year students are trying to transfer, which allows you to bond over a common goal. Another benefit of the amount of the large amount of first years trying to transfer to GT is that the advisors can help you create a good schedule that fits all of GT requirements, including the transfer credit equivalent. The downside is that there will be a little more competition to stand out in the transferring process, but that’ll probably be the same in any college in Georgia.

 The only issue is that the Atlanta campus isn’t that nice (it’s a bunch of buildings scattered Downtown), but it has its perks (good cheap food nearby, good coffee shops, no need for a car on campus, most first year classes are in same building). The campus doesn’t have a lot of common areas and green space, as the majority of students commute, that also means that weekends are pretty dull on campus.

I have been to KSU a couple times and their campus is better than GSU’s. I don’t know anything about their academics, but I believe that there are similar to GSU’s (specially during  freshman year). I have heard that it has a good social scene, and that being outside of the city allows for an easier commute. I have friends that transferred from KSU, and it was the same transfer if process.

Fellow transfer student. I transferred into tech with 45 hours and something like a 3.8 GPA. I heard the horror stories. I saw my sister struggle through her time here. I had many smirks when I told people I was transferring to Tech. I knew it was going to be hard, as you did too but that didn't make the transition any easier. The thing to remember is that you're here now so you have to make the best of what you have. Sure a 2.6 semester is a shit feeling but it also means you have a lot to build on. When I got my first sub 50 grade on a test at Tech, something that had never happened in my school career up to that point, I cried. I cried in class when I got it, I cried on the walk home to my dorm, and I cried on the phone to my mother. "" You have to pick me up, I'm not good enough, I can't do it, I thought I could but I can't"" The thing is, she didn't pick me up. I went back to class the next day and I got a plan for how I was going to improve my grades. It was hard and it sucked but every day at Tech since that fall has been easier. The thing that worked for me was to remember that you're not really here to have fun. 

You came to Tech (I assume) because you know the opportunity it affords down the road. If your life goals don't necessitate a degree from Tech, and trust me many many people who are at tech don't, then maybe it isn't for you and that is perfectly ok. If you do think you need a degree specifically from tech, then get a plan going for how to improve next semester. You can't change what's happened but you can move forward with a plan to do better. People bash this school for a lot of reasons but they really do have many services here aimed to help students like you. The more you take advantage of those services, the better off you'll be.

If this is for an spring internship, then yes. You should probably be worried. If you have any connections within your previous internship, I'd be contacting them to see if they have any last minute slots available.

Also try not to focus too much on what your friends do/don't have. Not that there's anything wrong with your friends having positions, but it'll honestly make you feel worse if they got something and you didn't, despite the billions of variables that go into these things.

You're probably feeling a lot of pain right now; what you need to realize, is that your pain is, in its truest form, energy. Use that energy, shape it, and direct it in a positive direction; namely, the motivation to make whatever changes you think you need to make.

Tech is such a rigorous school that to me, commuting seems like a terrible option. There’s plenty of lower-cost options for housing around tech, and the time that you save and the mental burden you lose is already worth it.

comments,"&gt;I really struggled this semester where it seemed like others were making ""A""s so easily. Physics has never felt natural to me, so to see a passing grade is a real relief. 

In Richard Feynman's (physics Nobel Prize laureate) autobiography, there's this great part where he goes on sabbatical to work in a friend's biology lab for a year. The gist of the story is that he did pretty badly, constantly embarrassing himself by pronouncing things wrong, asking for things that didn't actually exist (like a 'map of a cat'), and eventually contaminating a bunch of someone's high-value samples with microbe-contaminated liquid. At the end he talks about how the most important thing he learned from doing it was how to open tubes with one hand.

In other words, you can be literally one of the best in one field and not great in an adjacent field. The important thing is that you committed to learn some physics even though it isn't public policy, and you absolutely succeeded at that.

comments,"I transfered to tech this fall, as a physics major. Had 3.8 gpa and a 4.0 in my math n science classes.

I would not wait to apply, coz CS is hard to get in and most of the core classes taken at gsu dont transfer to tech which means u hv to retake those classes at tech. So excel in this spring sememster, fight for 4.0 and get in this fall2019
Another reason of applying asap is that if u get rejected u can reapply for the next semester. 

Have heard ppl getting rejected with a 4.0 and accepted with a 3.6, so dont worry about it too much (but still worry about it)(just dont punish urself)
Do something which will differentiate urself from other applicants, go to hackgt and do other extra/co-curriculars. Show ur passion for CS. Get good letters of recommendations. Write strong essays, go to career fairs at gsu, try for TA/LA posts in gsu, build a resume.
CS is very hard at tech, so gt looks for candids who can tackle the classes and take the pressure.

Hope this helps

Also, when you’re studying/doing homework, actually commit all of your attention to what you’re doing. I am amazed how my roommate manages to study 10hrs/day and still do poorly in classes, then I realized that his “studying” is him watching a lecture video while browing Instagram on his phone and listening to music. If you just sit down for like 1hr/week in each class you will literally be fine. The only studying I ever do is required homework and studying hard a couple days before big tests and I have a ~3.9 right now.

You could absolutely make it through with a TI-36 Pro. I used that one in CHEM 1310 (as my main one was banned) and had no real problems. The course is designed so that you'll struggle to get numeric answers without any calculator, but not to the point that you need an expensive graphing calculator.

That said, I personally used a TI Nspire CX CAS (that I already had from AP Calc) in 2211/2, and there were some things that it made easier. The ability to have the calculator work fully in variables sped up my test pace for symbolic test problems (probably the majority), as I wouldn't have to do the algebra myself. In 2212, it was helpful to be able to solve systems of equations at once (for circuits problems).

If you're in a program that is big enough to have multiple sections of classes, you should really **research every professor**. Look up their grading history on gtlite, get reviews from friends, and search for them on reddit, ratemyprofessor, and your major's facebook page.

comments,"Eh, its fine I guess. Shows what's possible, but not exactly what is -relevant-. 

It makes me anxious and insecure about my own lesser GPA, since it's my body's way of motivating me to ""correct a deficiency"". But it doesnt last, not anymore.

I just have a 2.3 GPA, and my friend has a 4.0 - I also need to do work-study, and he does not. I also have a senior position reserved for me at a steel construction company, and he does not. He also got awarded a grant to his undergrad team to develop a pencil-test alternative for an aerospace company, and I do not.

He wants to get into MSE, and maybe be a researcher. I want my own construction company, and make my own buildings.

Comparing my GPA stopped being relevant to me, because it got me no tangible rewards. Walking up.to a job site got me far more reward than studying for a final. And, being the lazy shit-for-brains bottom-feeder ball of philosophical and chemical energy I am, I go for the easy route to my goals. It just happens, that goal is to make mad bank and build cool shit. 

Idk, asking your question is dependent on your motivations. GPA is a tool for academic prowess - no more, no less. If it's relevant, great! If not, also great!

Just, get some chocolate and give yourself a full 48hrs to sit with your thoughts. Write down some stuff, see what's relevant to your future self.

I have changed my approach now my goal is not to maximize understanding but maximize grade outcome and my grades have increased dramatically; not my understanding though.

comments,"Fine. I'm not arguing that curves are better. I'm arguing they are a necessary evil when evaluating how comprehensively a student has learned the material of extremely difficult classes. For example, in heat transfer, the only way to test a student's understanding of forced internal convection is to give them a problem on it. If you studied hard and get the material, you can set up the problem, get a Reynold's number, and then follow the framework of getting a Nusselt number then finding h etc etc. But there are dozens of different Nusselt equations for very slightly different situations. These equations are long and easy to fuck up in your calculator. If there's a crossflow you have to calculate that too which has dozens of its own easy to fuck up equations. You have to pull half a dozen variables from tables for very specific temps and pressures, which sometimes have to be modified or interpolated. In this way, even if you follow the general steps and show understanding of underlying principles, there are dozens of difficult to avoid sources of error and you will likely get a completely wrong answer despite knowing what you're doing. By nature of the material any problem comprehensive enough to test real knowledge is also insanely difficult, too difficult to expect an ~80% average. There's no version of the problem where that's possible. The teacher didn't teach it badly and I didn't learn it wrong. It's just fucking hard. Therefore, curve.


As a freshman, you have not yet encountered classes of this difficulty. I don't hate you cause you're a dumb freshman, I am annoyed with you because you're not understanding or acknowledging the limits of your own Tech experiences.

comments,"Not saying things can't be institutionally improved, but I do think a lot of the culture shift needs to come from students. Personally, I haven't every felt severely victimized or prisoned by Tech. I balance my academic involvements with other stress-relieving things I enjoy doing-- dancing, hanging out with friends (of different majors too, so we don't default to talking about classes), going out, playing sports, working out, cooking, watching movies, etc. I actually still love going to school here, despite how shitty PTS is and how stressful school can be; it's balanced by some of the greatest times in life, also thanks to GT.

The thing I want to stress here is that it's a **proactive** **effort** on our part, as students, to balance our own lives. Yes, the institute can handle grading better so we're not failing classes until the end, only to have it curved 50 points. We shouldn't be pitted against our peers in an effort to be in the top X% of the class. I agree, and we should fight for that. In the moment, however, that's not going to change. At the end of the day, you're in charge of your own happiness. So make the decisions you need for yourself. Solve the problems around you-- create the next. Or just say fuck it, it sucks, find a way around it, and take the inconvenience as a cost for something greater you appreciate.

Go join another organization--change something up in life. Keep it exciting. If you hate your classes but feel like you'e stuck in your major, just involve yourself outside of it. If you enjoy them, good for you! It'll still be stressful at some point, but once you take a test, just learn from the experience and move on. Don't dwell on the past. Talk to your friends, vent, get the frustration out.

Every single thing isn't gonna be fun in the moment, but I believe that you can find a balance that works for you in the long run.

comments,"That's a good point. I came from out of state, so I never had to worry about losing a scholarship I couldn't get anyway.

As to talking to professors, I established 2 good relationships in my time. One was with my physics professor freshman year (Ed Greco, not sure if he works there anymore), and I sat in the front row of his class, paid attention, and asked/answered questions. So when I later went to his office and told him I was interested in doing research with him, he was very receptive. With the second professor (Lei Zhu, at the end of sophomore year), I literally just looked up some of his research and sent him an email asking if he had any undergraduate opportunities, having never previously spoken to him. I think I was the only undergraduate who had even asked him in some time, and he was happy to hook me up. It ended up being pretty difficult research to contribute to, since he didn't have an infrastructure in place to help undergraduates, but I did 3 semesters worth of research with him, took one of his grad level classes, and I got a nice letter of recommendation.

So I'd say just be direct, even if you haven't spoken to the prof before. Just tell them you want to do some undergrad research, and they'll probably at least engage with you.",positive,0.9526,positive,0.18333333333333335,12/16/2018

comments,"Yeah for heat transfer it's also impossible to learn all the concepts. Sure, it sounds easy to learn conduction, convection and radiation as overall concepts, and they're not hard to understand generally. But the breadth of problem types is staggering. Convection on a flat plate involves a totally different set of equations to convection of a fin heat sink, or a rectangular tube instead of a round one, or a rough surface to a smooth one. Radiation eqs are totally different for gray vs black surfaces or different shapes. Conduction eqs are totally different for a hollow shelled cylinder vs a solid one or a series of concentric spheres or 2d conduction in a plate. All of them are fair game and totally different animals. Impossible to completely master all of it. Exams are open book because you couldn't fit all the potential eqs you need even if you had 5 crib sheets.

This is where you not having taken a class like it makes it hard for you to understand. You do get partial credit, and that's why you can scrape together a 40 instead of a 0.

What's your argument them on classes where curves are definitively not necessary? I mean I'm still here in easy lower-level classes, but multiple classes that I am taking are being curved simply so that the professor can get the grade distribution looking how they want it. 

I was talking to some grad student, and they were telling me about how ""Asian professors, especially the younger ones without tenure, receive lots of complaints about their courses, so they just curve to give everyone higher grades to artificially make them happy.""

I wholeheartedly agree. As a transfer student (summer of this year, so admittedly pretty recent), it's really weird to see so many people so miserable here. I was *stoked* when I got my acceptance letter.

I know it's not all sunshine and rainbows here. I knew the classes would be challenging here (this is a plus in my book, my previous institution doesn't have the best CS program). Dining and PTS offer much, *much* more to be desired (especially PTS &gt;_&lt;).

There's so much opportunity at this school, but you have to realize that and make sure you capitalize on it as much as you can.

Multi does come up during diff eq depending on what material your professor chooses to cover. While you can learn how to do partial derivatives and related things pretty quickly, I think it’s easier to just go into the lesson knowing those things.

comments,"This is probably a less popular opinion, but I think campus stress levels have increased tremendously during my past 7 years here as an undergrad and then grad student. I don't think it's just students complaining on Reddit. Perhaps it has more to do with Tech's relatively quick increase in the quality of the average student. Compared to when I first entered, admissions is now more selective, SATs are higher, high school GPAs are higher. Students are used to being at the top, and I think part of the stress comes from trying to maintain that status in a really talented student body.

But, it also very largely depends on what the standards you set for yourself. I did my undergrad in 4 years and graduated with a 4.0.

comments,"Time management and sacrificing the amount of free or fun time.  You need to go to class, pay attention, take notes and then review said notes on a regular basis. Homework should be started early and you need to be fully vested.... Get through the work and don't forget about what you've done it what you've learned by doing the work as soon as you've completed it. Take time to study outside of normal course work.    The problem with GaTech is that you really have to take your academics seriously, which can stuck because it's also college which is probably the last time any of us will be young, surrounded by young peers and relatively unconstrained in terms of station,  responsibility,  obligation, and/or expectation.  Don't get me wrong, life can get way way better after college if you play your cards right... But the ability to live within that kind of vibrant, sheltered existence and environment is typically ephemeral.  Even if you can, most folks can't/won't maintain it for very long.  Life will track you down and take you to account.   

What happens is trying to decide upon what how to decide what balance of work, discipline and faith that your efforts will push you towards a better future is acceptable and can be maintained and how to manage the adverse effects (less fun, fewer opportunities for non academic experiences, more stress, danger of letting work become your life and achievement the only sustenance for ones self esteem).

There are other important lessons to be learned during this stage of life, and the rigor at Tech can stunt growth in other areas.

This is the source of the stress.  There isn't enough time in the day/week/month/semester to do it all without putting yourself at risk of burning out....and for what?  An internship that may or may not matter 3 years from now?  A slot at a company or in a program that someone else might have lucked or schmoozed their way into (or past).  Research that might set you up for major successes for the next phase of your life?   

A good GPA (or lack thereof) is like money.  It won't necessarily make life easy having it, but in se.circumstances not having it can lead to more obstacles between you and your goals.

My advice...if you do not have a good GPA, then use your hustle to make up for it.  Find part time work or internships or research or personal projects and work and network your way towards your goal.   People can and will sneer at a GPA all day... It is more difficult to shrug off or disregard the tangible fruits of one's labor.  If you get into the habit of being a self starter then you'll rarely want for a direction in which to move forward.

Look to the post that brought up our tradition of saying “I Got Out” instead of saying “I Graduated” as proof of the bonding that this school brings to its students and alumni. As others pointed out, social media also tends to highlight the extremes in experiences (who wants to share average events anyways) so consider that as well. 

This school is difficult and will likely test you, there’s no getting around it. But in the end you will be better off for it. You will still end up having a lot of fun here, if you want to. Like every school, a lot of Tech is what you make it.

This is a very savvy question.

The truth about gathering information online is that there is an immediate selection bias. Nobody who's not stressed is going to go online talking about how not-stressed they are. I can only say this - in the 90s it was very stressful. Everyone I graduated with had these:

&gt; It's been 8 years since I graduated from Tech, for some irrational reasons, some day I still wake up with a fear that I had forgotten to finish assignments 

The *""OMG I forgot to drop that class and now it's finals week""* nightmare is one I used to have about once per month, and seemed to be generally triggered by bouts of work stress. It lasted until I was about 40 years old. But that's anecdotal, and it's a decades old anecdote. 

In Tech's favor, I'll say this: It doesn't hurt to try it out and see. You can always quit/transfer if you don't like it. I know a lot of folks who failed out of GT and were still tremendously successful.

SOUP is for students who can’t make it to campus over the summer. It’s a fully online course vs. a flipped classroom.

No...I’m saying most flipped classrooms are implemented badly. Fully online courses like OMS and SOUP are different and can go well, but most students here value an in-person lecture more since it’s what they’re paying for.

It’s an experimental class capped at 50 and has a reputation for being easier than regular 1301. It’s also the exception to the rule as I heard it’s implemented pretty well.

comments,"To be fair, an NRE degree isn’t really about learning how to operate a plant. The only class I’m aware of that even touches on plant operation is Abdel-Khalik’s LWR Tech class where he teaches the systems and functions. Most of the NRE degree is teaching you about radiation and how particles interact, with emphasis on the core neutronics. 

I didn’t go into the degree expecting to learn how to operate one, and that’s not what I got. The purpose is to teach the physics, the how it happens, not how it’s run. With a degree you have an understanding of how to use the data you have to get to criticality if at all, run simulations for it, manage waste in the sense of the response of activity over time, etc. Not, well once you have it all in place and don’t really need to worry about the physics all that much since it’s set in concrete now, how do I keep soluble boron the right concentration, keep pumps steady and know the backups and procedures, know the RCIC, RHR and HPCS, and or even fuel loading for a new type of fuel. 

You don’t come out knowing those things, but you know how to apply the degree, interplolating that boron should fluctuate with time, steady pumps won’t change power levels, heat removal is necessary, and can merit a guess what will happen with a new fuel type based on geometry and composition.

&gt;You said most students avoid video lectures. If that is the case then why is MIT OCW so popular then since students in general hate video lectures 

The implication I made in my original comment (This is basically the flipped classroom concept and it is implemented for a few classes. Most of them are really badly implemented so the majority of students avoid them.) was that most students avoid **flipped classrooms.** Not video lectures.

It was also implied that we're talking about GT students since you're in /r/gatech asking why GT hasn't implemented recorded lectures in GT classes. 

MIT OCW is popular for a variety of reasons; college students may use them as a supplement to their own lectures (but honestly I haven't seen any students here use it), or people who aren't even college students use it to learn more, etc. 

&gt;Why not make it an option for every class to be online ?

It's not as easy or inexpensive to implement as you think it is. GT is a public university as well, vs. MIT which is private.

As for the gym, I personally didn’t make use of one during my time, but I know some people that did. I think they used the one next door that was more expensive and they liked it. When you first get there the program director will likely ask if you’re interested in the on campus gym and the monthly fee was relatively cheap as far as I remember, so that process is pretty simple because it will mostly be taken care of for you as long as you let the program director know.

comments,"Hey! I took ISyE this past semester. I don't know what the other sections did, but mine started off with basic probability axioms, independence, conditional probability and all the formulas that follow them. Other big, more specific ideas are law of total probability and when to use it, Bayes' theorem (this one isn't really important because it's easy to derive but memorizing the formula makes the problem easier). Get really good at the card problems. Get to know those well (at least understand the concepts) because pretty much everything after is gonna be built off of these basic ideas. For example, you learn in the first week that the formula for conditional for event a given event b be has happened is p(a and b)/p(a). Later on, in a more difficult case, you would need to use the law of total probability to find p(a) and you need an understanding of independence to find p(a and b). Also, there are different ways to find the probabilities depending on if it's discrete or continuous, joint or single variable. 

&amp;#x200B;

So after learning the basics, you move onto random variables and different distributions. There are two kinds: discrete and continuous. The big ones for discrete are bernoulli, binomial, geometric, poisson. Continuous: exponential, continuous, gaussian/normal. With each of these, learn how to identify them when given a scenario (don't worry, after a few practice problems they become really easy), calculate conditional probability, calculate the mean/expected value and the variance (learn the identities and formulas. Discrete has a different way to find these than continuous), find the cdf. For discrete, you need to learn how to find the pmf. Continuous: pdf. Continuous utilizes integrals so if you're not the best at them you should review basic ones. Smaller topics are markov's inequality and learning how to approximate upper bounds, approximating binomial with poisson, approximating bernoulli with laplace. 

&amp;#x200B;

After single random variable, you move onto joint distributions and basically do all the above. It's an extension of what you've already learned. Needless to say it gets a little trickier in joint distributions, especially continuous with all the double integrals. You learn about covariances. Towards the last few weeks of class, you learn about the central limit theorem and how to use it.

comments,"From the perspective of how learning works, simply listening to a lecture that was given in a class is not a particularly effective approach to learning. At best, you will be able to get something into your notes that you missed the first time around. At worst, you will think it's a replacement for the face to face version (thereby missing out on a lot of communicative cues that feed into your ability to learn), and you will mistake familiarity with the recording for actual understanding and learning (also why you shouldn't just review your notes over and over again to study). Overall, when learning in an online/recorded setting, simply listening to a recording is a subpar way to learn.

What you *should* be looking for are support materials from instructors to supplement your learning. A text book, access to videos or other content that covers a particularly difficult concept in a voice different from your professor's, practice problems that you haven't seen before, access to office hours to help when you're stuck, homework assignments that help you build your new skills, and so on.

So I can see why you might think that having lecture recordings available might be a good thing, but it actually turns out that they aren't the real answer, and most times are not likely worth the resources it takes to produce them.

comments,"To say something new, I'd rework the CS courses. A good number of classes (1331, 1332, and 2340 come to mind) are probably less effective than several online tutorials I've seen. Nobody should be paying tens of thousands of dollars for these.  2110 was the only gen-ed CS class that I felt was really worthwhile. 1332 in particular is an embarrassment for Tech

I also wish we had more classes on some topics like compilers and functional programming

For example, u(sic)ga has built 6 new dorms in the 2000s, and my flagship state school (Tennessee) is opening 7 new residence halls by 2019.  To be blunt, I'm jealous that there haven't been new developments in GT Housing during my lifetime, and that less rigorous schools have newer (and sometimes cheaper) facilities.

In addition, setting mini goals for big, somewhat daunting goals is really helpful. Like one goal you might have is ""get research next semester"". So a few mini goals would be ""Look up at least 5 professors you might be interested in doing research with, and narrow the list down to 2 professors by looking at their recent work"" or ""Email professors asking for research"" or ""Look up and apply to two labs before spring break"".

comments,"Honestly, you're doing fine.  As people have said, take initiative to find undergrad research opportunities and internships.  You might not get several for one reason or another, but, with persistence, you're going to find something.  A 3.1 GPA is hardly a disqualifying factor for either of those things.  I know that it never feels good to get a C, especially when you've gotten good grades previously in your Tech career.  Give yourself 2-3 days to beat yourself up over it if you need to, but then it's time to move on - last semester is over and you get a clean slate now from which to build yourself.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also, just a heads up, even if you don't get into grad school, your future is not bleak.  You'll have an EE BS degree from one of the best engineering schools in the world.  You can get a really well paying job and, after a couple of years, your company will probably have a program to pay for you to go to grad school if you still want to.  In that case, you end up with the same degree without having to stress about funding: a win-win.  There are always paths open too you other than the one you initially envisioned, and you have no way of knowing what the ""best"" one truly would have been.  All you can do is make the most of your situation, enjoy the process, and be willing to adjust your plan to get you to where you want to be should you need to.

As for the interviewing, almost everyone feels nervous and messes up during interviews. I think it helps to prepare doing a mock interview with another person just because it will help get you out of your comfort zone. Having a real person there will make you more familiar with how to calm your nerves and present yourself the best you can. I have the same problem and practice helped a lot.

Also, you don't have to feel bad for venting. You're right, it might help some people to know that others are going through the same things.

I lost all my scholarships because of those D’s, and I took out a ton of student loans (before the reform, when they were more predatory). I’m still paying them off, but they’re manageable and I learned a lot about personal finances.

I took a co-op as an IT guy at a local telco consulting company because my GPA wasn’t good enough for the “good” roles. 10 years later and two job changes later I run a 40 person consulting team *because* of the professional connections I made in that original co-op.

I met a girl at a party. She wasn’t supposed to be there and I definitely wasn’t looking for anything serious. We ended up getting married *before* I graduated.

Those 5.5 years were damn tough, especially after digging myself into a 6-D hole. Nothing in my professional experience has come close to being as tough as Tech and you’ll be a great employee, and likely a solid leader, because of it.

However the new head TA is a better person than I am and did actually send rejection emails to the people who interviewed but didn't make the cut.

With the exception of classes like 2050, which apparently hire without interviews sometimes, aka they'll like yolo at the beginning of the sem if they need somebody, I would say that if you didn't get an interview by this point (end of the sem) you probably didn't get it. However I don't think it would hurt to email the head TA if you're really curious, we wouldn't have minded or would mind at least.

Honestly dude if you didn't get it, please don't feel bad. TA hiring is a total crapshoot. It's largely based on TAs' gut which is wrong a lot. Like some TAs almost don't get hired but turn out to be amazing. Others get hired, top of the queue, and they are... _not_ amazing. Getting a TA job is not equivalent to being capable of TAing well, in other words, and even if it were I hope there's a class that clicks with you. 2110 was that class for me, I love it.

comments,"Currently a freshman so maybe my experience isn't as valid, but to my knowledge, time management skills are what will end up having a huge impact on whether or not you have a mental breakdown.  Most of my friends who had mental breakdowns or were dying of stress had packed way too much on their plates.  I'm talking 4 extra curriculars, 2 of which tacked on outside work commitments, and tried to balance a social life outside of those clubs as well.  The others having panic attacks were those who were ultimately unmotivated or feeling depressed because of non-academic things such as not feeling any accomplishment in life or having a good network of friends, but this ended up tanking their grades and just adding on academics to the list of things to be depressed about.

I'd say it's also about finding the resources you need whether it be academic help, a social network, or even therapy sessions and being able to manage your time and have self control in an environment where attendance isn't necessarily required and where procrastination is so much easier.

Ultimately if you feel like you were an academically strong student in high school, you probably have the mental capability to do fine in your classes, but it's a lot of the other things that dictate whether or not you actually will.

Hope this helps.

I was in these shoes at GT. It takes work, but you can get past it. 

Put yourself in situations to talk in public as much as possible. In a group project? Volunteer to be the presenter when discussing updates, presentations, etc. Search for a student organization where you feel comfortable talking about a topic you know about, and use that to gain comfort and trust in public speaking. 

Newborns don't come out of the womb being comfortable talking in stressful situations. Everyone has to coach themselves on how to work around or over it. 

I also adopted the approach of public speaking [following President Barack Obama's speech patterns](https://www.inc.com/wanda-thibodeaux/want-to-be-a-brilliant-public-speaker-take-a-cue-from-one-of-president-obamas-qu.html) - don't be afraid to stop or pause conversation to search for the right word or flow. If you find yourself stuttering and stammering, test out changing out your speech process by being more measured in how you formulate your conversation. You could even test this out in an online game or in a low-stress situation where social anxiety cues may be lessened. It works wonders in interviews.

You can do this. ",positive,0.896,positive,0.09793650793650793,12/18/2018

[Here's the policy](http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/policies/grading-gpa/grade-substitution/) on freshman forgiveness. The main things to note are that you must fill out the form before next semester ends and retake the course before your fourth semester ends, and you are not eligible if you were caught cheating in the course.

Now, as for tips for how to succeed when you retake it:

1. Start the homeworks the day they're posted. This is the best tip anyone can give for 1371. As you now know, the homeworks are miserably long and tedious. Start them ASAP and use Piazza liberally. If you aren't sure where to start, try drawing out the described process in full (including edge cases, which 1371 loves), then convert that to code, piece by piece.

2. Go to Kantwon's lectures or at least use his lecture notes (you'll have access to them even if you aren't registered for his section if you didn't notice). For tests, you'll be at an advantage next time because you'll know what kinds of questions to expect.

You probably already know this, but 1371 is not a class to neglect if the material doesn't come naturally to you. I believe you'll be able to make it next time, so don't let it get you down too much now! Also, think about what you did right and wrong the first time and try to figure out how to correct what didn't work.",positive,0.8888,positive,0.11056998556998555,12/18/2018

If everybody took the exact same amount of credit hours the average gpa as shown in the table would be the exact same as the average of students gpas for that semester. Most people take nearly the same credit hours at there time at gatech so the average gpa as shown in the table is very near the average of students gpas.

edit: Additionally if we assume the average gpa does not change with time (it can change from grade levels, but that change must have already been like that meaning it used to change in the same way with change in grade levels)  then this gpa nearly (same if same credit hours) represents the average gpa of those who graduate from tech (assumng no failing out or transfer)",positive,0.2231,neutral,-0.011666666666666667,12/18/2018

comments,"-from a 6th year- 
I changed my major twice, had to withdraw in 2016 due to a mental health crisis, and was finally anticipated to graduate this semester. 

Turns out, I didn't pass two classes. Tried pulling it out at the last minute, even had a devoted group of friends pushing me constantly at the end to grind and get out (they even made a GroupMe for that sole purpose), but was only successful with two of my other classes I took this semester, or so it appears based on my current transcript - still fighting to have one of those failing grades rounded up. 

There is a lot of shame I'm dealing with, because a lot of people were expecting me to graduate. I even walked across the stage at commencement and shook Bud Peterson's hand, all while feeling like I shouldn't be up there because I already knew I had failed one class. 

I'm dealing with feeling inadequate as well, despite other evidence pointing to the fact I am.

My advice is coming from someone in the middle of it. There is a difference between knowing something to be true, and actually believing it enough to let that knowledge affect the way you think and act. Plenty of people can tell you their ""best"" strategies and techniques for studying, for sports, or for life in general. I doubt any of them follow them 100% of the time. If the professional football players on the Falcons roster can lose the Superbowl after being up 28-3 and still sell tickets to their games the next season (the pain is gone, the memes continue), you can fail all your classes and still come back next year and kick gluteus maximus. That's what I learned from dropping out my 4th year, coming back after a semester break, then earning a higher semester GPA than any semester prior to that. I wish it hadn't taken all that to figure out what I'm doing and how to do it. But somehow, life is still amazing in a lot of ways. And guess what? This year, I failed again. But you know what? I may not have become better at school, I may have forgotten a lot of the stuff I learned, but after writing this and processing what has happened, I think the problems I'm dealing with aren't as big as I've made them to be.",negative,-0.9664,positive,0.05443548387096775,12/18/2018

comments,"I disagree with all of this - we have an office of disability services (ODS) that is set up to handle specifically situations like this. Approaching the professor directly is not the appropriate course of action until you've established yourself as a student with accommodations through the ODS. Professors are not required to accommodate you unless you're registered with ODS and can put them in awkward positions of saying no, being accused of favoritism or unfair practices if they do accommodate you outside of the official system. The system is there to protect both student and professor. Further, the professors are not entitled to know the details of the situation requiring accommodation, merely what logistics / accommodations must be made. This prevents the student from having to disclose their issue to the professor and have it be awkward or bias them.

comments,"Ive never done drugs or alcohol, but I do have a problem with very low self esteem and an inferiority complex. At times, it gets to the point where I question the validity of my own existence. I've not been diagnosed by a professional, so whether it's depression or not is uncertain.

A lot of the time, I keep wondering if I'm even employable/""worth-it"". My GPA is high as well, but I haven't gotten any internship offers yet (not that that's relevant to one's worth as a person).

My advice, which should be taken with a grain of salt, as I am not a mental health expert, is to take ""baby steps"" to get rid of your addiction. Focus on quitting a bit at a time. For instance, try substituting an alcoholic drink for a short exercise session (exercise has been proven to improve mental health). Then, if you still crave other drugs, substitute something else for them.

Additionally, if it is possible, find a way to get other mental health professionals to help. If it's too expensive, ask a group of friends or acquaintances. The great evil of depression is that it attacks one's self worth. So, let it be known that I, and the countless other Gech denizens, care about you and your self-worth. Thus, I highly encourage you to seek help and get rid of this illness.

That's all I have right now. Hope it helps!",positive,0.8967,neutral,0.029255952380952386,12/19/2018
comments,"Hey op, I'm really sorry to hear about your depression and addiction. I haven't dealt with substance abuse myself but I do have unhealthy habits I turn to in order to hide from my depression. It's been on and realllyyyy on for about 6 years, and I'm only now confronting my issues (major depression, empty feeling, self harm, suicidal thoughts). **My first suggestion is to tell someone in your life**. I finally told my parents a couple months ago that I've been depressed for a while and needed a therapist, and I told my friends and boyfriend about the stuff that goes on in my head. It's really helped having people to talk to, even if its uncomfortable at times. Taking that step has also kept me on track and honest about my progress since they ask me how I'm doing and what I'm doing to improve my situation. Tell your parents you need help of some kind. Just be honest about your struggles and hopefully they'll focus on helping you. I think having a therapist could help you since you seem to trade off one addiction for another, and possibly rehab if you think the situation warrants it. Unfortunately telling people who aren't invested in you isn't going to pay off ^(and GT isn't invested in our mental health), which is why you should talk to the people you're close to.   


Also, you need to cut out the enablers in your life. If someone is still pushing you to smoke or drink, especially if you tell them your situation and they keep doing it, you need to drop them. It's toxic and you don't need them to drag you down when you're already down. Delete your dealer's number. Throw away anything that has to do with drugs and alcohol and don't give yourself a way to get it again. Be honest with yourself and the people around you. This admission is a great step towards and healthier and happier life, but it doesn't end with just posting about it. Take solid steps toward finding your happiness, and if you ever want to talk please feel free to dm me.  Good luck :)",positive,0.9852,positive,0.13466880341880344,12/19/2018

comments,"Hi Pete, former student and CRC employee (not a lifeguard) here. I think I can shed some light on the situation. 

There is a general lack of accountability when it comes to CRC student employees. Our bosses consistently do not punish offenders so people consistently goof off. Unfortunately, this includes showing up late and closing early which leads to inconsistent hours. 

Though, I would argue that the lack of accountability is calculated on the part of our bosses. The CRC does not have enough employees so firing bad apples is off the table. Also, throughout the semester the CRC continually bleeds employees who find better jobs elsewhere. 

Throw in the fact that 75% of the workforce disappears over break and it becomes a surprise they attempt to keep the pool open at all. 

All the issues are magnified for the aquatic center because it is, with out a doubt, the most mind-numbing job on campus. When people are swimming, the lifeguards cannot talk or have headphones in. Just sit there, stare at swimmers, and have the same trash-pop music rotation echo through their brains. 

I am sorry the CRC can't fulfill what it promises. I wish my coworkers and bosses were more conscientious. But you won't find a solution (much like my chbe 2100 HW :[ ) except to wait till next semester when we all come back.",negative,-0.7935,neutral,-0.022619047619047605,12/19/2018

&gt;on and realllyyyy on

That's a really succinct way to describe depression. Too real.

I've taken a couple cracks at proper therapy but both did not turn out well (didn't mesh well with the Therapist). I tried to make 3 visits to Stamps Psychiatry this semester but only got to sit down for 1 (long story short - some of the staff there are pretty disrespectful of your time; the two out of three scheduled visits I didn't ""attend"" both involved me sitting in the waiting room for 25 minutes beyond the time my session was supposed to start and eventually walking out). I may try to revisit counselling in the future.

I'm fortunate enough to have 2 close friends I've been able to confide my depression in and they've been immensely helpful.

1. Cut out your enablers. Someone already mentioned it and its great advice. This is my brother's largest pitfall and it has caused him to relapse several times now. It might be hard to cut those ties, but its step one really.

2. Get back into your hobbies and start new ones. For real, pick up a sport like running, weight training, disc golf, etc. It gives you something to focus on.

3.  Don't have cash on you. This is one I think my brother picked up in rehab. With a credit card, someone can hold you accountable to your purchases. If you're carrying around cash, its impossible to do that.

4. Set small goals for yourself. Little victories get the ball rolling on your overall war.

Good luck brother. Just know that it is not a hopeless en devour and wanting to turn it around is a powerful first step.",positive,0.9513,positive,0.05287433155080213,12/19/2018

I cannot tell you how much I related to this post. I too discovered alcohol as a freshman  and it quickly escalated out of control and it led me into trying other things to manage my habit.

Steel your mental fortitude and understand that the anguish you will experience in quitting all these drugs is normal. Expect that aguish, experience it, and push onwards in spite of it. You will have to be strong, but you'll find that you have it in you. 

Right now, getting clean is your purpose. Once you've done that, go learn about existentialism; that will help you deal with the trauma you've likely been through. Good luck, and remember, you are all the things that are wrong (and not wrong) with you.

comments,"I'd like to think the students are getting better.  If nothing else, because of the way high school works now, fewer students are actually taking all the weed courses everyone used to take that destroyed GPAs. When I came 100 years ago, I'd taken 5 AP courses and that was considered amazing and rare. Now, it seems that most of you are coming in with a lot more than that, and having (believe it or not) an easier first term (the literature suggests the first term matters a *lot*). 

I'd love to see how the number of hours / term has changed over time. I didn't take fewer than 17 hours until I was a senior by credit hours and even then I was still taking 5 - 7 courses (I got out with three minors (or the closest we had to minors back then)) a term.  And I was doing a light load compared to my ME friends.

I say this of course without knowing what kind of relationship you had with your instructors, but please reach out to them BEFORE you are just on the edge of one grade or another, or in danger of failing a course. You'll likely be referred to the Center of Academic Success now, and if you aren't, you should consider contacting them yourself. Unfortunately, once you get to the end of the semester, it's usually too late too do anything. And speaking as a former teacher, the most annoying students were the ones who made no attempt to reach out/get help during the semester, then came at the end, hat in hand, hoping to get grades rounded up (sometimes way up). There are a lot of resources available on campus, but no one is going to search you out to offer homework help, you've got to accept your own agency and find the assistance you need.

For third years it becomes a lot more difficult if you're planning to graduate in four, and you'd have to ask GT cadre about specifics.

I had serious pain in my joints which I attributed to various injuries, and I was a ball of anxiety that dripped a trail of melancholy everywhere I went. Somehow I managed to do okay academically and excel professionally. I smoked because... Well... As I'm sure you understand it *just made everything seem less shitty*. Everything was indeed shitty to the Nth degree but since I didn't care it was manageable. I got adicted to the pain pills I was prescribed to deal with my Sciatica/Fibromyalgia and when I had a serious mental health episode I took Celexa, Prozac, abilify, welbutrin, diazepam, lorazepam, trazadone, geodon, seroquel... You name it, nothing helped.

I smoked a lot of weed, and I sailed through a pack of cigarettes a day. After school I got married and had kids and continued through every day in physical and emotional anguish getting stoned when needed in order to NOT hurt myself; I had other people to think about.

A little while ago I got diagnosed with chronic disseminated lyme disease I had likely contracted a couple of decades before (I think hiking down by the hooch). I took some serious antibiotics and for the first time in my life that I remember I dont just want to lay down and die anymore.

The exam dates were super flexible (you're given \~a week from the date its released to take it). Other than that, it's very close to taking the course IRL as everything is exactly the same (rewinding/2x speeding lectures is the bomb tho).",positive,0.9738,positive,0.12374999999999999,12/20/2018

I got quite lucky, but I think going to smaller companies / start-ups and talking to people directly rather than through an application portal (whenever the opportunity presents itself) is a decent shot. 

I also think it's worth it to try, because then you'll have some experience with job hunting for next year! It's very much okay if you don't get an offer this summer because GT will give you tools to find jobs in your later years. ",positive,0.9439,positive,0.175,12/20/2018

No one is going to care what your GPA is with a PhD.  PhD=good enough automatically, especially if it says GT on it.

comments,"I had an internship summer after freshman year and it was hugely beneficial to me. It's definitely worth exploring the opportunity to do one. That being said, it's gonna take a lot of leg work on your part, because careerbuzz isn't going to do much for you here.

Go out and apply to things. Personally reach out to startups. There are internship opportunities out there, it's a matter of finding them. Usually after freshman year you'll have better chances at smaller companies. But really, when it comes down to it, there is a decent chance that you might come up empty. That's okay, and you really shouldn't be too disheartened if that happens. It's not expected that you have an internship after freshman year, so you're not falling behind or anything.

Finally, my last piece of advice is in life, but especially while at GT, don't bother comparing yourself to others all the time. There's almost always going to be someone better than you at something, and accepting that is important. Instead of trying to ""keep up with the Joneses"" you just need to focus on yourself",positive,0.9847,positive,0.13216374269005848,12/20/2018

This could help you figure out if there is anything you aren’t aware of that you are doing in interviews that makes companies less likely to hire you. 

Also, get your resume reviewed by recruiters specifically.

There are also other factors at play - someone may have had opportunities in high school that you didn’t or just have parents that are well connected. That is just to say that you shouldn’t take it to mean that you are in any way less because you don’t find something. Most people don’t have a whole lot of marketable skills related to their major after 1 year and that is perfectly fine and normal.

That said, there are sometimes programs that specifically target freshmen and sophomores, so I’d try to apply to those if you really want to find something. Even with those though your odds are pretty slim since there will be so many first year applying with nearly identical resumes.

I always suggest studying abroad the summer after first year. That way the summer doesn’t go to waste and it’s usually the best opportunity for study abroad since you probably will want to be working in future summers.",positive,0.9849,positive,0.18413043478260868,12/20/2018

comments,"**3 helpful hints:**

If you look at the National Center for Educational Statistics you will find that every year there are just over 1.2 million Masters/PhD graduates in the US. 

(this will get you started: [https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017136.pdf](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017136.pdf))  

You are not only competing for jobs with this group, but also with active employment seekers with similar credential AND real life experience in the roles...  So the question becomes, *""How do I market myself to the firms that are doing interesting work that I would enjoy doing?""*

**Advisement hint #1:**  ""my GPA is okish..."", i can code less ""decently"" blah blah blah... your brutal honesty here tells HR managers that you are NOT the person to hire. You need to reign in your self-criticism and be bullish about yourself.   who cares how good you are at application""X""... what you are good at is learning applications, tools and turning that ability into actionable and revenue generating gains.  I will guarantee you that in any workplace you walk into, you will NOT know all or any of the tools needed... but you can damn well learn anything...and quickly...and not only that be willing to teach others.  Play up your strengths and your ability to contribute to a team and provide exceptional value and service to your employer.  This is what HR managers want to hear.   Not that you suck and PML5 programming.  If they ask you about VBA it is safe to say you have functional experience with the tool...  no need to volunteer your harsh opinion of your competencies.

**Advisement hint #2:**  Research the companies you are going to interview with.  Know what is currently going on in their press releases.  Know the names of their officers.  Know their products and what they do. Know their core values and activities they sponsor. Address your hiring managers by name and anyone else you meet by name.  Find a scenario where you could fit into what they are doing and how you can help take them to the next level.  Be that positive  energy that tells an HR manager that if they hire you they will not regret it.  You must be interested, informed and can provide value... you WILL stand out and this will often get you a second interview.

**Advisement hint #3:**  Make multiple resumes.  I start with a primary generic resume that is good for posting on broad based job search engines.  I try to focus on key search words.  Keep the language about what you can do and not what you can't do.  For skills that you have a bit of exposure to but could pick up with a few weeks of really focused hard work don't be afraid to include these skills...  You can say ""Familiar with Natural Language Processing Algorithms...even when your real experience is with other Machine Learning processes and you only have a basic familiarity with NLPA tools.  A Masters or PhD means you have the ability to learn what you need to know quickly.   

For jobs that I really want to dive into I will create a custom resume for each job application tailored to that specific job.  Say for instance I really want to do bio-medical research, I would then really tailor my resume to those critical skills and experiences that I have  that strongly align with what they are doing.  I will focus on bio-statistics and research methods. I would push less relevant skills down and move the key and critical skills to the top.  Most HR managers will have a stack of resumes on their desk and they are only looking at the first page of every resume.... make sure your targeted skills are easily spotted and recognized. This will prevent your resume from being tossed to the side as not having the desired skills in the initial screening process.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck with your search!

The outcome of a decision doesn't imply the correctness of the decision. And the whole point of this is to say that Wes Durham believes that Geoff Collins was the best decision for Tech to make based on that Tech made it for the right reasons. If Geoff Collins doesn't work out for some unforseen reason, does that mean it was a bad decision to hire him in the first place? Not by Wes Durham's reasoning!

comments,"&gt; So then it's a fair analogy? Alright, glad we're in agreement.

Perfect. Now walk backwards.

There is no possible way to determine whether a college football coaching hire is the right hire other than win loss record, in the eyes of the people who hire and fire the coaches, because the perfect coach who runs into a stream of bad luck is going to be kicked to the curb, while a horrible coach who runs into a stream of great luck is going to get a raise and an extension. This is baked into the nature of college football fans, who are the people who buy the tickets, which produces the money, with which we pay college football coaches. They do not differentiate between being lucky and being good.

So for college football, it is literally impossible to determine who is a better coaching hire until you see what the wins and losses look like, because that is literally the definition of ""better coaching hire."" It is tautologically true, because it can't be untrue, because of who evaluates what amounts to a ""good football coach.""

comments,"&gt;There is no possible way to determine whether a college football coaching hire is the right hire other than win loss record

Then why bother with going through a hiring process? Why not just pick someone off the street, let them coach a season, and determine if they get another season as coach based on that? After all, if this is *the only possible way* to determine it, there's no reason to go through this arbitrary bullshit of interviewing a hiree, checking their references, evaluating their history at other programs, etc. 

If anything, Stansburry is just blindly wandering through the darkness of coaching without any indicators as to who the right person to hire is. I mean, you *could* evaluate candidates based on an interview and their history and their references, but by your *expressed words*, that has zero bearing in determining whether or not someone is the right hire, so why bother?

In fact, let's go ahead and hire you as our head football coach. Bye Geoff, you're out: /u/Beej67, you're in - after all, there is literally no possible way to decide who the best fit for a program without throwing them into the gauntlet and letting them do their thing, so it could very well end up that *you* are a better head football coach than Collins, right? We just have no possible way of knowing beforehand! We'll give you three years to turn the program around, and only after the fact will we know if we made the right decision. Best of luck.

We'll tune out anyone who has an opinion that hiring some reddit user is not a good decision. If Ken Seguira asks Todd Stansburry why he hired a reddit user as opposed to an actual professional football coach, he'll say, ""We can't know for certain if it was the right move yet. We'll just have to wait and see.""

Wes Durham questions our reasoning and logic? ""We'll see.""

Mark Bradley thinks Georgia will stomp over a program without a head with any experience? ""We'll see.""

Jeff Schultz wonders if this spells the end of GT football for good? ""We'll see.""

***

You see how absurd you sound? If someone offers their opinion on whether or not Durham is the right hire or not, the response is not ""we'll see"" - people are more than capable of evaluating Georgia Tech's decision based on the factors that are available in the present. Tech made what they felt was the right decision without knowing with certainty what the future held, only that based on these factors, the future appeared best with Collins. Other people can offer their opinions on how that prediction might hold up, but if you say, ""we'll see"", you're setting yourself up to fall victim to [Hindsight Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias).

Tech has the tools to make a decision from their available options. Someone else is capable at looking at what tools Tech had available and judging Tech on their ability to use those tools properly. But none of those tools is some psychic foresight of Tech's 2023 conference record. How patently absurd.",positive,0.9803,positive,0.16848958333333333,12/20/2018

comments,"PTS' goal is to send an email notifying all effected customers 48-72 hours in advance of any impact to their parking. This is more important when we truly need the space cleared and less so when we can cone the spaces off and/or work around the vehicles. In W25's case, we coned the spaces off the night before and worked around any cars that were already there.  As a result, the email from Wednesday was really intended to keep customers informed so that when they showed up the next morning and cones were all over the place not to be surprised and/or to move the cones. We did not cite or tow a single car.

In cases where citing and towing is needed (i.e. Georgia Tech Football Games) we will not only make sure we meet our 48-72 hour email deadline but we place No Parking signs in the areas, and post notices on social media.  If we have to tow we make every attempt to contact the customer first (via text, email and/or phone) to move thier vehicle before actual towing occurs.

Approximately 3% of all of PTS’ revenue comes from citations and towing. Believe me I wish it was zero but unfortunately, it is a necessary evil.  Enforcement is a critical parking management strategy that is needed to ensure that parking regulations are followed.  This ultimately leads to a more efficient parking system for all.

As for the request and graphic, PTS received both from Faciliteis much later than what is printed on the document. My guess is that the date is when the document was created.

I happen to think that Geoff Collins is probably the best hire given our current situation *with the fans and boosters,* although if they weren't in play we would probably have better in-field results stealing Monken from Army.

But that opinion *literally doesn't matter,* because the hire will be evaluated based on whether he succeeds or fails, and on no other criteria whatsoever. What you describe is a good, objective rational position that makes *no difference in the world of college football*. Take, for example, George O'Leary and Chan Gailey. Were Chan coaching against Donnan at UGA then Chan would have won well over 50% of his games. George had the benefit of coaching against Donnan and won three of five. George was a ""good hire"" and Chan was a ""bad hire,"" literally because of their records, not any other reason. And not only that, literally because of their records against Georgia.

comments,"This has helped considerably, but if the AP was better, speeds would be much higher. I believe the ones you installed do **867Mbps** theoretical over 5GHz, and approximating for real-world usage with interference: 867/3 ~ about **250-350Mbps** best-case. Though it seems to fluctuate a bit too much.

Using a decent 60$ AC (1700 or better) router would net 450-650Mbps probably - though these would unsuitable for multiple-dwelling-unit deployments. Wired performance is consistently 1Gbps, which is super.

I just got a great idea to make money off of a idea for developing countries that I've never been to nor have I any idea what systems and cultural differences exist.

I'm looking for a cheap smart dude that I can abuse to build my pipe dream into reality, so if anyone is really dumb and wants to join, or knows someone dumb enough to join, let me know!

You need:

 - To be able to work with my money people in the US and bribe people in china and help me understand how china works

comments,"I did my Bachelor's in CS here at Gatech, and am currently doing my Master's here as well.

I'm sorry to say I don't know much about neuroscience at Tech, but I think the opportunities that Tech has to offer definitely outweigh a slightly lower GPA. We have events like UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunities) which is a research fair where research labs showcase their work, and try to recruit interested students. If you play your cards right, then you might even be able to secure a research position as a freshman. 

Again, I don't know the details for grad school for neuroscience, but for CS at least, GPA wasn't the only important thing. All of the schools I applied to wanted to know my work/internship experience, research experience, personal motivation, and of course what my professors thought of me (recommendations). GPA is only one part of the equation, and it's not always a bad thing if it happens to be a little low. Most grad programs expect at least a 3.0 GPA to be considered though, so if you're really worried about Tech's program and think that you can't keep at least a B average, then it might be worth thinking about other schools.

The problem is, you can't really gauge how successful you'll be at Tech until you've experienced it yourself. I made it out with around 3.2, and I had to work my ass off to get it. Others I know barely studied, and got nearly perfect GPAs. Anyways, best of luck in admissions, and I hope you'll consider Tech for your undergrad studies! There are a lot of great things about this school, and I don't regret my choice (for both Undergrad and Grad) at all!  ",positive,0.9946,positive,0.18145461309523808,12/20/2018

comments,"To clarify what IceColdy29 said, [the policy](https://registrar.gatech.edu/alumni/readmission#two-or-more) is that you will be considered to have left Tech (requiring readmission to continue) if you do not take classes for two or more consecutive semesters (incl Summer).

Registering your internship overrides that rule for the semester you're interning. For summer internships, it doesn't matter, as you'll resume classes in the Fall (only one semester away). But most people don't take classes during the summer, so if that's the case and you intern in Fall or Spring, you'll be missing two semesters, triggering the rule.

Some scenarios where registration isn't necessary outside of Summer:

* Study abroad over Summer &gt; intern in Fall -&gt; Registration **not** required.

I hate to be that person, but going by the course syllabus, mse3005 seems highly related to coe3001, and having taken 3001 twice unsuccessfully leaves a lot of doubt that you are ready to take 3005, much less alongside 3001.

comments,"&gt; Right now, at 3:07 PM on December 20, 2018, Geoff Collins was a good hire.

No. Right now, it *looks* like a good hire. Whether or not it *is* a good hire will be determined by results. If you disagree, feel free to tell me what the exact probability is that Coach Collins will beat Clemson in next year's opener. You can't.

The fundamental flaw with your analogy is that *a coaching hire is not a lottery ticket*. The lottery is a purely probabilistic exercise, in which every single individual play has an independently equal chance of winning. College football is not based on random chance, it's an imperfect meritocracy. 

When you're playing a game based on pure probabilities, hindsight is useless. That's because of the inherent independence of such probabilistic events. However, hindsight is *not* useless in a meritocracy, it is essential to evaluating past decisions and rectifying mistakes.

&gt;Five years from now, he will still have been a good hire because Tech effectively utilized its available resources to select the best football coach at the time

This is absurd. By your logic, there is no such thing as a bad decision that only seemed like a good one at the time. If it seems good at the time, it is a de facto good decision. We all know that this is false. Sometimes a bad decision only *looks* like the best one. That doesn't make it a good decision.The fact that something *appears* to be the best decision at any point in time does not mean that it is *in fact* the best decision. 

That's why every business in America collects data to retrospectively evaluate their own past decisions. In a game of chance, decisions are evaluated on pure probability. In business, decisions are evaluated by results. If you aren't re-evaluating your business decisions based on their results, you are an idiot.

If Geoff Collins goes 0-60 over the course of five years, that would definitively prove that it was a bad hire. In that scenario, anybody who maintains that it was actually a good decision simply because we had limited knowledge at the time would be rightly viewed as a fool. It's entirely possible to make a bad business decision while thinking it's a good one, and the only way to find out which is which is with results and hindsight.",positive,0.9884,positive,0.15342261904761903,12/20/2018

I hate to tell you this but the reality is life isn't fair and isnt always supposed to feel good. your situation is something 99.99% at this school will NEVER be able to relate to. Jack, a third year, is worried about whether this one assignment will cause his grade to change from 91.6 to 89.8. Jill, a second year, is worried about wheyher Ryan will ask her to his formal.

This situation you are going through will make you tougher, stronger, better. I guarantee it.

comments,"In my experience, Georgia Tech students are not very politically aware, so let me lay out some reasons I hate this:

1) Brian Kemp ran a very conservative campaign, one of whose main selling points was rounding up illegal immigrants himself. He portrayed himself as an even more right wing caricature of Trump. 

2) He blatantly suppressed thousands of minority voters and refused to resign as Secretary of State, which oversees elections in Georgia, while he himself was on the ballot for governor, and in general is a corrupt piece of shit.

And perhaps worst of all,

3)  He went to u(sic)ga.

I just want to see Tech associated at all with him. I don't really know how possible that is since Tech's a state school and he's literally about to become governor. But still.

It's interesting that when people post questions about how tough Tech is, there's an overwhelming response of ""Not that bad,"" but in everyday conversation or posts, people are ""dying."" Some of it, yes, is bonding over complaints and selection bias, but the complaints represent a very real and *intense* stress that you should be aware of. There's something of an expectation of suffering here, from both professors and students, that leads to an unhealthy balance.

comments,"The other comment was sarcastic; but here's what's really wrong with your post.

1. In just a few lines you harp on the unprecedented and implied certain growth of the company and want to ""share the wealth"". Most of us just see this as ""you won't get paid much, if at all; You'll be abused as a worker but if by some miracle this thing takes off you'll have some stake in the company"".

2. Full stack doesn't exist like this. Sorry, it just doesn't. Hiring one ""Full stack"" dev doesn't mean you now have the ability to assemble an entire backend, manage a database, and build consumer-facing applications. You need a team for this, plain and simple.

3. You're far too vague. You don't give your name, company name, contact info, or any real information about the business at all, leading us to believe this truly is just an idea with nothing else to back it. If you're really a ""Business guy"" with 15+ yrs of F500 experience than you should be more than comfortable sharing your name and previous employment with us. Honestly... If you're all that and have done ANYTHING useful in your career you probably wouldn't be asking for full-stack devs on reddit but I digress....

If this is just some far-fetched dream at this stage, that's fine, that's awesome actually. But if you want someone to jump into this idea with you, just say so. Don't go on spouting about some absurd niche market cap numbers, you just sound insane and too caught up for your own good. Honestly, this crowd will respond better to ""I have a crazy idea that might just work come join me!"" vs you trying to convince them this is a sound employment opportunity.

comments,"The Office of Information Technology’s Cyber Security unit has identified a widespread email phishing attack and identify theft scam that targeted approximately 8,800 students, faculty, and staff at Georgia Tech. Cyber Security is working with impacted parties to ensure the integrity of their personal information is preserved following the attack.

The original message was sent to Georgia Tech recipients Saturday, Dec. 15. Throughout the day, Cyber Security received several reports of suspicious messages – all of which had varying subject lines and messaging but encouraged recipients to participate in a car wrap advertising scam. The sender falsely promised easy money to individuals who agreed to shrink-wrap their cars with ads for popular brands. The purpose of this scheme is to solicit personal information from recipients and con individuals into wiring money to scammers.

The following information was requested from the adversary:

* Full Name:
* Residential Mailing Address (Not PO BOX):
* City:
* State:
* Zip code:
* Country:
* Car Make/Model:
* Telephone numbers:
* Average miles driven each day:
* Have you held a VALID US license?

The suspicious email reports were ultimately traced back to the same [gatech.edu](http://gatech.edu/) email address, which appears to have been compromised in a previous phishing message. The compromised account was immediately reset. Cyber Security also alerted recipients of the attack and encouraged them not to reply. 

Some individuals have, since, notified Cyber Security that they did reply with personal information and may have attached signed PDF documents in their responses. The unit encourages anyone who has done so to contact its Security Operations Center immediately at [soc@gatech.edu](mailto:soc@gatech.edu) and also report this incident to [IdentifyTheft.gov](http://identifytheft.gov/) at [https://www.identitytheft.gov/](https://www.identitytheft.gov/). 

Quick Facts:

The National Consumers League Fraud Center has been receiving reports of car wrapping scams since 2013.

Legitimate advertising campaigns will never request that participants wire money back from their personal banking accounts.

He did not make this law but merely did his job as secretary of state enforcing existing laws. Additionally this law is necessary for voting fraud prevention.

comments,"That's not the way they used to do it. You used to be able to call in. I don't know for sure, but here are a few possible reasons: 

Reduce no-shows. People are more likely to follow up if they've already put in some effort. Their resources have been so low for so long, that it was a waste to have unfilled time slots if someone no shows. Likewise, no matter how strongly students were told to come early to do the paperwork, most of them didn't. So, much of the initial consultation was taken up by paperwork, which 'wasted' up to 1/2 a session. 

If someone is in crisis, they can walk in and be seen that day, any time. It's more efficient for the people in crisis, but less efficient for everyone else. 

HIPPA compliant software for online communication regarding medical records is f*$%ing expensive. Keeping the records online isn't so bad, but transmission of info can be a problem. 

People would say over the phone they needed an immediate appointment, and then would come in and - granted, they felt horrible, but it was not an ""emergency."" Some people would call and not ask for crisis appointments when they truly needed them. People need to be triaged, and it's not ethical to ask the receptionist to triage callers for psychiatric need. They can't pay a therapist to be a receptionist. If a therapist is answering calls, s/he is not seeing clients. 

Finally, there are some definite unsolvable problems, and so they are just flat out doing something different because something needs to change. Sometimes you just have to change something, gather data, and see how it works or doesn't work. 

I hope that with the new resources promised, that they can fully staff crisis hours and regular eval sessions properly. 

If you are on campus for class or something else, try to find an errand in that direction. Then, at least you can drop in, fill out the paperwork, and have your next 'obligation' all set to go.

- If you failed your last semester and have any proof to show for it, doctor's note form the health center, etc; it is sometimes possible to have the school discard the semester for your gpa. *this is easier if you ask for help before the end of the semester though.

comments,"&gt;Can you name one time where he actually suppressed minorities?

Legality of enforcing the 'exact match' law is itself probably doubtful. It was struck down by a District Judge in November. Obviously will go through further appeals but Kemp's rules are hardly settled law.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/03/judge-rules-against-brian-kemp-over-georgia-voting-restrictions-days-before-gubernatorial-election/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.b49e61a9df22

A more compelling fact is that Kemp also purged 340k voters for a 'change of address' that didn't actually happen. That seems hardly legal to me. Especially ahead of his own run for governor. 

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/19/georgia-governor-race-voter-suppression-brian-kemp

&gt;Stacey Abrams wanted every vote to count, Brian Kemp wanted every legal vote to count. There is a difference.

Just gonna throw it out there that voter fraud is ridiculously rare in the United States and is mostly just exploited in-name by the GOP as an excuse to purge the votes of certain demographic groups likely to swing Democrat. There is a reason why Trump's voter-integrity commission was disbanded after years of searching for mythical 'illegal votes' in California and subsequently turning up with nothing.

Fast forward 4 years to me at my grad program at a different school, the same scenario occured where I showed up to their mental health services bawling.

It is up to his office to determine how to carry out the 'exact match' law - he expunged registrations that were wrong by exactly one hyphen (such as 'Mendez-Garcia' vs 'Mendez Garcia'). However, that's irrelevant now because Kemp is governor-elect and will soon sign off on state legislature. 

&gt;Secondly it is very reasonable to ensure that voters are residence of the state that they vote in. That policy is very reasonable and gave the people 2 years to respond.

Is it reasonable to prevent large amounts of people from exercising their legal right to vote in order to prevent an extremely rare crime? Which is honestly a bigger affront to freedom and democracy - a form of fraud so rare that it can almost never swing an election, or disenfranchising thousands of people through overzealously strict voter registration laws? 

For the record too - that '2 years to respond' notification was not as faithfully administered as you think it was. My voter registration in Georgia failed twice for completely unknown reasons and I received zero notification of it. It was only my obsessive habit of checking Kemp's stupid website that clued me in.

They will accept spring grades - just have your university send your spring transcript to them automatically in May once finals are over. 

Also I know people with 3.75+ GPA’s who got denied (and one with a 4.0, but i’m unsure how believable his story is).

I would say if you’re transferring from a hard school, a 3.3 is worth a shot. 

Finally I’ll say this. If you can barely keep a B average at your current university (which I’m assuming was less rigorous to get into than GT), odds are you will be having a rough time at Tech. I’m not saying you’ll do bad if you came here, I just want to put things into perspective if you haven’t already.

Maybe also Kalamata?). All of those also accept Buzz and Dining. 

With the current meal plan options, it’s not a significantly better deal to get X amount of swipes versus spending the same amount on pure Dining Dollars (aside from the freshmen options, if one needs that much food). (It may be a better value if you eat more on East Campus. Swipes are worth $10 at West Village where food is more a la carte, but they’re $14+ at the buffet style dining halls) 

As a result, I’ve just gotten Dining Dollars for the past few semesters. I sometimes cook or eat frozen dinners, and the $600 plan lasted all semester. There’s also a $400 option that  has the 10% bonus. They expire at the end of the spring semester. 

If you feel like getting other pre-made food or cooking, Publix and Kroger have great selections. You can get a good-sized hot meal at the Publix deli for $7.99 or less, if I remember correctly.

comments,"Be aware, GPA depends greatly on major and which professors you get. Also, you won't know until you get here if something like lecture classes really isn't how you learn. (It's not for me, to the point where I am a B/C student in them if I take more than 6-8 hours that semester). I don't know much about neuroscience, but I know the science-based majors tend to have higher GPA's than the Engineering based majors. 

I see a lot of people on here saying how us complaining isn't something you should take so seriously, but for some people coming to Tech really can be a huge adjustment. If you went to a smaller high school, a high school with a weaker stem program or are very young (under 18 at the point of entering college), you might want to be more cautious, as these things can suggest that you are too confident about your current skill level, as compared to Tech's curriculum.

Also, since neuroscience is new, we don't even know if we have a strong program here. They could just take a combo of the BME and Bio major classes and make them brainy, without a true neuroscience focus. 

Overall, Tech looks good for Grad school. But, if you don't do research you won't get in. If you are really concerned, look at the research opportunities in your field at the different schools you are considering. 

And at the end of the day, know its ok if you come to Tech and become an A/B/C student instead of the all A student you once were. Tech is great at providing you with the skills you need to be excellent in your chosen profession. And always remember, B/C students are often better in the working world than all A students.

comments,"Your problem is not the drugs and alcohol. The drugs you mentioned are by far the most functional drugs that the US runs on besides caffeine. Plenty of people that are pretty wonky live by microdosing LSD daily even. Your problem is the depression. You're just self medicating, and it just isn't cutting it anymore. Going into rehab to fix a ""drug problem"" will only make you infinitely more depressed, because you're going to be cutting off everything you've been using to make yourself feel half decent. Go to a counselor and please please please work on the depression WITHOUT stopping your drug regimen first. Kratom and pot are great for people that want to live functional lives.

&amp;#x200B;

This is coming from another successful GT student with plenty of vices that sound far scarier than any you have (I won't name stuff, but definitely in the category of hard drugs), so hopefully you can trust my opinion. For real, the drugs are not the problem. Either way, you're in a medicated world. Unless you go through the insanely slow and painful process of working through whatever problems you may have, doctors will just fill your brain with serotonin (SSRI's) for the time being. Try SSRI's for a bit maybe. They worked well for me when things were really bad by just taking the edge off of everything. While doped up and in a livable state, work on the underlying issues you have either with a counselor or by self reflecting, because it'll be slightly less painful with the medication. If you have to go to the counselor high to make any progress, that's what you have to do. I don't open up to people unless I'm not fully there mentally, so don't feel bad if you're the same way.

I applied for grade forgiveness at the community college and brought my GPA up to a 3.7; I applied to GT and got in. I'm here now with a 4.0 after my 3rd semester, and I have to say that some of the things which helped me most with my depression and lack of motivation were the exact drugs named here. I bust ass all day and come home and smoke weed and have a nice meal; it really helps me destress and honestly I find nothing wrong with that sort of reward system, even if it is technically self-medicating.

People say modern is easier because there is a chance that you have a vPython question on your exam. The content is essentially the same give or take like a week of lecture.

Tips for an A: 

- Prep for the material before each lecture so you can actively participate in clickers. They are only helpful if you know whats going on. 

- Make sure to do your hw early so you can get extra credit. 

- Get familiar with testing format, usually four frq and six mc so figure out what the main questions for each unit you need to know how to do.",positive,0.9389,positive,0.08970588235294119,12/23/2018

It's just four questions on each test, all being multi-part. Almost always, they're all FRQs. Occasionally, you might get lucky with one being MC.

Other than that, this is all good advice for getting an A in the class.

Also, actively participate in the lab whiteboard problems. They're actually pretty good for learning how to solve the types of problems that'll appear on the test. Don't stress out over lab quizzes, they're a small part of your grade.

The material we covered was basically just momentum, energy, work, angular momentum, pretty typical for a mechanics course.


The programming stuff is super easy it's the same concepts rehashed each unit. Don't worry about it, there's usually like 2 or 3 vpython questions on the tests total over the entire semester. 


There's a bunch of extra credit in the course, I think it was out of 108% with like extra points coming from participation, finishing homework early, going to public lectures, etc.

comments,"I will admit that the naming convention for the different networks across campus can be a bit confusing. We're working on consolidating the naming and back-ends of the systems to hopefully make it less confusing.

/u/GTWreckTechs is correct in their response. LAWN is the ""Local Area Walkup/Wireless Network"" across campus. That includes eduroam, GTother, and GTvisitor on the wireless side in all campus and residential buildings. On the wired side, LAWN refers to the general-purpose wired network that exists in places like Klaus, Clough, College of Business, the Library, and other places with publicly accessible wired network ports that aren't managed by one specific department (outside of ResNet and EastNet) .

""ResNet"" refers to any network in the residence halls, including (wireless) LAWN and START. START is the wired network in ResNet and EastNet, similar to Wired LAWN elsewhere on campus. It has its own subnet and VLAN assignment as well as registration system that's completely separate from LAWN.  

Eduroam, GTother, and GTvisitor (as part of LAWN) are the same networks across campus including ResNet and EastNet. There is a pool of VLANs that are used for Eduroam that are assigned based on a hash of your username. Once the hash is computed, any of your devices should get assigned to the same network regardless of where you are on campus.

comments,"By saying that I get a reserved IP address, do you just mean that I get a static IP address?

comments,"&gt;By saying that I get a reserved IP address, do you just mean that I get a static IP address?

Short answer is yes.

Longer answer: A reserved IP address is much like a static IP, but there's an important distinction. DHCP reserved addresses are still assigned dynamically by our network equipment to your device but you'll get the same one every time. Static IP addresses in the usual sense are hardcoded into the customer's device(s) - doing this on ResNet will _not_ work and will result in a loss of all network connectivity.

&gt;If so, why should i even need one to run a web server, other than that fact that the setup would be simpler? Is it not still doable with a dynamic IP address?

Registering with ISS disabled (and therefore getting a reserved IP) also opens up the campus firewalls to allow other devices (both on and off campus) to connect to your device's web server. If you leave ISS enabled and therefore get a dynamic IP, only device that are also on the same START network will be able to connect to your web server.",positive,0.9259,positive,0.09338235294117647,12/26/2018

2) some classes can be boring, IMO this will happen with a couple classes in every major however, also this may be dependent on professor/instructor

3) while the money/career prospects are nice, my field is also the only thing I could envision myself doing 40 hours/week (everything else in high school kinda bored me, but I'm i interested my field). In this way, I am very lucky that my field happens to pay well, and I recognize I am quite privileged as a result. I hold a lotta respect for the folks who follow what they love, as I do, but their fields naturally don't pay well and might be less societally respected, but those folks don't care and follow what they love, more power to them ✊

as a sidenote, for a lil while in my life I considered doing culinary, but that field is so cutthroat and tiring (i dare to say its twice as demanding as the hardest CS job) I'll stick to it being a nice hobby for now

comments,"That's interesting you say that about Collins. What are some of the things you don't like about him?

The way I see it, we weren't going to hire another option coach because it does hurt recruiting and a lot of the fanbase was sick of it. The Clemson OC was probably the ideal candidate, but it was going to take a lot to convince him to leave. Collins is solid defensively and he's done a fine job leading Temple, but more importantly are the things he contributes outside of X's and O's. He's from Georgia and has recruited for Tech in the past, so he already knows how to sell the school. This combined with increased finding from the AA for more dedicated recruiters should help with the talent gap between us and the other ACC schools. He's also young, energetic and by all accounts is a coach players love to play for. He's already done a great job of appealing to the fanbase and getting many of them back on board. 

By no means is he going to turn us into the next Clemson are suddenly have us competing for a national championship, but there's no coach that could do that. I think he is going to be able to have us consistently compete for the Coastal (much like CPJ) and at the end of the day that seems like a realistic expectation for Tech. 

Yes there's going to be rebuilding and some initial pains but Stansbury and Collins both are committed to seeing this change and that makes me hopeful for the future.

comments,"Hi!

1) Can I ride on the side walks? What about if there is no bike lane? 

No, riding a bicycle on the sidewalk is against Georgia law - OCGA 40-6-144.  If a bike lane is not provided you can ride as close as practical / safe to the far right side of the lane, nearest the curb. 

2) can I ride through the cross walks? 

No, you will have to treat the bicycle like it's a car.  You can dismount and walk the bike across the cross walk. 

3) can I ride on the the side walks around campus that aren’t street adjacent 

Such as Tech Green / Skiles Walkway, or shared pathways? Yes. But it can be a bit dangerous when school's in session.

4) what’s the most common reason GTPD cites cyclists and how can I avoid it? 

We try to educate more than cite but causing an accident, running red lights, running stop signs, not yielding to pedestrians can get you a citation. 

5) any other general information you want cyclists to know about?  

Be safe and follow all the traffic laws.  And we strongly suggest wearing a helmet. Any further questions about anything bike related, don't hesitate to reach out and ask us! Enjoy your new bike!

comments,"City sidewalks are defined in law and shared walkways are defined in campus policy.  The main difference is that ""Shared Walkways"" here on campus are on private property vs the city sidewalks, which are not.  Being on private property or being designated specifically as a bicycle lane is what makes it legal.  All the sidewalks on campus and around campus are not shared walkways and bicycles are not allowed via Georgia law.

OCGA 40-1-1 ""Sidewalk"" means that portion of a street between the curb lines, or the lateral lines of a railway, and the adjacent property lines, intended for use by pedestrians.""

Hope that helps.

comments,"Great to see the enthusiasm! Sports are fun and a good way of connecting to your school and those around you. Generally GT is biggest on football and basketball. We've had a fair amount of success in football (4 National Championships, the latest in 1990). In fact, we're probably the last team to win a National Championship that does not have a top 30 athletic spending budget. In basketball, we were the runner up of the 2004 National Championship and have otherwise had a decent to great program over the last couple decades. I am not as educated on our other sport histories, but I know we are generally great at golf and women's tennis. Baseball has also had a fair amount of success over the years.

[This is a nice review of the basics of football.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t6hM5tRlfA) They leave out some small details, but this is about all you need to know. The only difference in college is that the rosters go up to 85 scholarship players. Paul Johnson was our head coach the last 11 seasons and mainly was known for his unique offense. He retired a couple weeks ago. We recently hired a new coach named Geoff Collins who is known for his defense and his great recruiting. It will be a fairly large change of pace and is an exciting time to get into football.

[Here is a good review of basketball.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbtmGKif7Ck) The head coach is Josh Pastner and he's been great about building enthusiasm and excitement around the program. Like Collins, he came in with a reputation as a great recruiter. He's had some modest success the last two seasons and we are entering conference play pretty soon.

We play in the Atlantic Coast Conference (aka the ACC). We are among five conferences often called the Power 5. This is because these teams (65 in total) spend more on their athletic programs than most others and are seen as the most elite athletically. That being said, GT is almost always in the bottom quartile in spending, which generally labels our team as an ""underdog"" among our peers. This is in contrast to programs like UGA, Alabama, Auburn, and Clemson that are top 10 spenders.

I highly recommend you join a sports forum like [GT Swarm](https://gtswarm.com/forums/georgia-tech-football.4/) if you want to keep up to date on all of the athletics.

We'll see. Using NFL concepts, this won't happen if we continue to have recruiting classes ranked #11 in the ACC. We all know his strength is selling the brand and recruiting, but the question he will answer for us at GT is just how much a head coach like Collins can move the needle on that compared to a coach like CPJ. 

If he can really step up our recruiting, we'll compete for the coastal every year. If, in two or three years, we're still not even top 10 in the ACC in recruiting, I think things will only get worse.

I'm ready to move on from CPJ, but only time will tell if Coach Collins can be successful at Tech. I'm enjoying his charisma and the energy he's bringing, but next year is definitely going to be rough.",positive,0.9789,positive,0.18571428571428572,12/27/2018

comments,"Look into the Regents Engineering Pathway Program. It’s the most realistic way for any in state student to get accepted into Tech nowadays. Back when I transferred it was under a different name (RETP) and the deal was if you had a 2.7 math/science GPA with a 3.0 overall you were automatically accepted. Then in 2013 they changed it to 3.0 across the board for automatic acceptance. I transferred from Valdosta State but there are 17+ schools that participate in the program. Tech will never tell you you’re “automatically” accepted in the program and that the review process is “holistic” but in reality Georgia Tech cut a deal with the Georgia Board of Regents back in 1992 when they tried to monopolize engineering in GA so that no other school could have a program. The 17 schools that capitulated all became feeder schools and in exchange Tech made it so that requirements were more lax, hence why the program is called the “Regents” transfer program. Schools like UGA and Georgia State were banned from starting an engineering school for competition  reasons until 2014 when it just so happened there were 5 UGA alums on the Board of Regents that overruled the 20+ year law in a 5-4 ruling. Anyway, it worked for me in 2014 but the requirements have been increased again to a 3.3 for most majors. You’ll save money in the long run, increase your probability of keeping HOPE due to an easier time keeping up your grades, and ultimately once you graduate from Tech it’ll never say where you came from to get to Tech, only that you’re a graduate. My diploma came in the mail in June and from personal experience I’d say that’s the way to go. ",positive,0.9507,positive,0.1036111111111111,12/27/2018

We have mutual aid agreements with Atlanta Police and other local law enforcement agencies, where we could offer assistance in a critical incident and vice versa.  

Q5 : do you read like legal books and stuff? How are you trained on bylaws and regs?  That’s how I spend my Friday nights!  But for real, we have yearly and sometimes monthly legal updates which includes state law and local ordinances. And I personally read the OCGA and City Ordinances to keep it fresh in my mind and to understand the elements of the crime.

comments,"Hi! So first off, drinking or being in possession of alcohol underage is illegal and against the student code of conduct.  We obviously don’t recommend drinking until you’re 21.  And then drugs are always illegal.

THAT BEING SAID...

Georgia has the 911 Medical Amnesty Law.  You can read it here:

http://www.nchrc.org/assets/Georgia-overdose-prevention-law-legal-review-via-NCHRC-and-NPHL.pdf

This means “that anyone seeking medical assistance for themselves or someone else for a drug overdose can’t be charged if the evidence of a drug violation results “solely from seeking such medical assistance.”

We don’t really have a choice in “getting someone in trouble” under these circumstances.  GA law is clear someone can’t be prosecuted if they are seeking help as it is described in the law.

To anyone reading this... if you’re underage or using drugs and you or someone else needs help... call us!!! We are here to help you.... not get you into trouble. 

I have personally been to many calls just like this and I have NEVER gotten the caller into trouble even if they are underage or using drugs.

Usually the projects tend to be very creative using a wide range of mediums such as AR, VR, processing. These projects definitely helped me get job offers and hackathon invitations. Keep in mind it also depends on how much time and effort you put into these classes though. 
Feel free to dm me if you have any more questions! ",positive,0.9604,positive,0.15390625,12/28/2018

comments,"I had Wells Fargo and hated it. Their student checking account required a $1500 minimum balance or 10 transactions on the debit card every month, or else they’d fine you $10. Every month. Unless your parents help you out, you basically don’t have $1500 or have to remember to make 10 transactions every month.

Unrelated to checking but I was roped into getting their student credit card as well (it was my first credit card and bank account) and it has awful rewards and foreign transaction fees on top of that. 

If you don’t need to deposit cash into your account often, I’d highly recommend Charles Schwab’s checking. They’re entirely online and have very few physical locations, but they reimburse all ATM fees when using their debit card, which means you can use any ATM whenever you need cash. They also have no foreign transaction fees and reimburse overseas, so if you’re travelling or studying abroad, you can get local currency from any ATM whenever you want.

Only downside is the online thing if you require physical location services (mainly depositing cash into your account, checks can be deposited directly using mobile deposit in their app), and they don’t have the option to send you email/text updates when your account balance changes. But I’d take those downsides over WF any day.",positive,0.8954,neutral,-0.03932291666666667,12/28/2018

I've used various banks for different purposes, but Schwab is my daily driver and I haven't had any urge to switch to the other banks I've messed with. **Every** ATM is your ATM, for free. Not having access to cash deposits is a downside, but I haven't had enough of a need for it to care.

Credit unions are another good choice as far as avoiding the big national brick-and-mortar banks, but in my experience the more local/state ones tend to lag behind in UI/UX as far as their websites and apps. National ones like Ally don't have those problems, though.

**Note: Schwab requires a credit check (aka a hard pull/inquiry) to open an account. It's no big deal, but if that matters to you it's something to consider. However, they are currently offering a bonus of $100 for opening an account if you sign up using [this link](https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/promo/refer-prospect.html?refrid=REFER6EYV774D) (disclaimer: I don't get anything for you using that link, it's a public link)**",positive,0.9687,positive,0.10833333333333335,12/28/2018

We went over many interesting concepts and cemented my interest in CS (I was on the border before then). The focus was on discussion and proofs rather than following instructions and understanding examples.

However, this does not mean the class itself was easy. As people have mentioned, I met some of the smartest people at the college through that class. I had to go to office hours for homework help (more than I have for any other class since) but I do feel like I truly learned a lot. All in all, if you want another large lecture-style course where you just have to show up and follow instructions, take 2050, but if you really want to grow and challenge yourself, want to learn from the brightest, and participate in discussions with the professor, I would highly suggest taking CS 2051.

The main difference that you'll need to watch out for is 2051 doesn't do nearly as much hand-holding and is not nearly as fucking pedantic as 2050. For that reason it's that much harder since you have to put in considerably more work if you've never been exposed to proofs before. 2050 can sneak up on you if you slack because it seems easy, and 2051 will fuck your shit up if you don't go to class and do the homeworks properly since there's so much material.

On that note though, if you put in the work for the class, you'll really get your tuition's worth out of it. It moves at a rapid pace and covers a large variety of topics in-depth. I'd really recommend it for everybody, unless life is kicking you in the balls for some reason to the point where you can't put in the time, in which case take 2050.

As for general tips for either class, learn your definitions and notes thoroughly. You'll be expected to reproduce both what you've learned and to an extent extrapolate on it.",negative,-0.5838,positive,0.11325187969924813,12/28/2018

Jesus fuck dude, you trying to die? Props if you pull this off.

Anyway, one thing to realize about 1332, that's a time sink. Projects and test cases are annoying as shit. 2340 can be easy if you have a good team but you could also end up having to pick up the slack for your team, which would make it another time sink.

Beyond that, analysis is generally a hard class that you'll have to put a lot of work into (so I hear) and I personally think probability theory would he easy, but I haven't taken that specific class (though I have taken 3670, which is obviously different, so take that with a grain of salt). Dont know anything about 4032, so let's hope somebody comments about that one, but it also will probably take a lot of work.

Don't know anybody who took 2561, I'd be curious to hear how that is. 1331 is boring but easy, the professor you have is nice in my experience (she's a former coworker of mine). 2105 is also boring but easy, don't slack too hard and it's an easy A (seriously, don't slack, you'll be kicking yourself later if you do). 1102 is fine, don't worry about it. 2106 can be a very forgiving class, it's an easy A or B if you keep up with going to class and doing homeworks **properly**. I got a C and I really didn't put in much effort at all. For the love of god, READ THE FUCKING BOOK. They pull homework and exams questions from it.

When you get there you’re given a metro/bus pass (covered in all those fees you paid) so you can easily get to anywhere in the city. In the residence we stayed at, a lot of places like the beach and shopping/eating areas were walking distance so it was really fun to take advantage of that as well. 

Some advice that I have would be to always be aware of your surroundings and cling tightly to any bag or items that you’re carrying. I personally did not get pick pocketed but a large number of people in the study abroad program did, so really be aware! Also take advantage of exploring parts of Europe that you’d never imagined you’d go to, like aside from the basic (sorry) France or Italy. I would recommend going to countries like Greece, Hungary, Croatia, Poland, Switzerland, etc. 

Before you get to Europe, don’t forget to buy adapters for your chargers!! And while you’re in Europe, be sure to always have some cash on you as some places don’t accept certain credit cards or any credit card at all (a lot of places do though).

If you are a part of the CS Barcelona Summer Program and you’re living at Residencia Onix.... go to the local grocery store MERCADONA!!!!!! They have freshly squeezed orange juice and some of the best chocolate chip muffins I have ever had. I hope you have the one of the greatest summers of your life!!

comments,"&gt; I'd be kinda surprised if nobody asked you that question during the process

It's because they usually can't. Recruiters typically are not allowed to directly ask if someone is a citizen or not at a career fair or interview. There are ethical and legal issues that prevent recruiters from discriminating against candidates based on sex, race, nationality, citizenship, sexuality, etc... so most recruiters will never ask directly about your citizenship status and rather wait for you to self disclose on the actual application.

It is however allowed to be asked during an online application process. Those questions typically have a disclaimer that it does not affect the application process; it's mainly there so that if you lie about your citizenship then they can terminate you if you ended up getting the job. It is implied that you are a citizen if you apply for one of these positions if it is a requirement in the job requisition.",positive,0.5492,positive,0.12361111111111112,12/29/2018

comments,"GSU as in Georgia Southern or Georgia State bc the two provide two completely different options. If Georgia Southern, then stick with engineering and just use the REPP program, but if State then ultimately it won’t make a difference between the two since Georgia State is not REPP eligible. I will say mechanical engineering statistically has the most applicants and therefore has a lower probability of acceptance. Also trying to change your major after acceptance assuming you get in is usually a bad idea. Once again, if you’re using REPP, then you’ll have a major lock that will prevent you from changing majors for either a semester or two. If you have a rough first semester then you’re screwed because you need a 3.0 or higher to change into almost all engineering majors and should you have a sub 3.0 then you’ll be stuck in that major until you raise your gpa. Ultimately I’d say you need to stick with what you plan on making a career out of or otherwise you’ll just be wasting time trying to choose a major that’ll increase your probability of being accepted.

Perimeter originally was granted the transfer program in 1986 and is simply retaining what has already been in place for over 30 years.

When you apply to Perimeter it is not even the same application as Georgia State and the requirements are not the same.

What I can say is your Math/Science gpa will be heavily scrutinized so your calculus courses as well as physics and chemistry will likely be a make or break case bc GT openly states that they take the Math/Science gpa as an entire metric on how successful you’ll be in your given major. Ultimately, the best thing you can do is keep your options open. I know that’s not easy in GA due to a lack of quality engineering schools but you definitely want to expand and make a plan B, C etc. The only other advice I can give is to try to apply for the Summer semester if possible.

It's usually wise to become suspicious any time you see someone quoting Adam Smith.  Economic thinking has progressed kind of dramatically since the 1700s, and quoting Smith is often a sign that someone doesn't understand economics as much as they'd have you believe.

I kind of quit reading after that, couldn't stop laughing long enough to keep my foil hat from falling off.

Mark Richt may not have been a successful coach as far as victories are concerned, but he was a good man and a good leader of men. That is, leader of men who were willing to be led. He sought to grow his players to be loving and caring husband's and father's rather than trying to force them to win. When he came to Miami (his Alma mater), he came with a hope to try and turn around the culture and put Miami's program in a positive light. It was clear that the players and even some of his assistants didn't buy into it (made even more clear by them now hiring Manny Diaz as head coach). He lost control of a program because he was trying to lead men that would rather be thugs than good men.

Go discuss your situation with the Dean of Students the first chance you get.  Send an email.  Set up and appointment.  Bring documentation if you have it.  Explain where you are and ask for help.

The sooner you reach out, the more flexibility the administration has in dealing with your situation.  If you bailed on the last couple weeks or so of classes due to a medical issue such as depression, the incomplete is there to address that exact situation.

Go talk to them.
