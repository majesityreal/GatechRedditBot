I worked hard to automate most of their legacy QA processes as they were folded into Watson cloud and tying to scale. IBM‚Äôs business model for acquisitions seems to fall into the ‚Äúgive them a year, then overhaul Everything‚Äù category. Our year had poor product leadership, a lack of executive vision, and a revolving door of corporate ‚Äúexecutive sponsors‚Äù for our business unit. When we approached our one year mark, a slip up from another team cost our division a massive contract penalty, and they took it as a sign to start slashing. Nearly 40% of my business unit was laid off within a week, myself included. From the folks I know still there (who haven‚Äôt been laid off or constructively dismisses with demotions or confusing re-orgs), leadership issues persist all the way to the top, with Ginni not sure what the company wants to be when it grows up, and too big a ship to keep changing course.",negative,-0.8254,neutral,0.04652777777777776,09/30/2019

&gt;forcing him to shoot them

**No one** forced the officer to shoot. I will never deny the difficulty of the job of police officer, but it is precisely these worst-case scenarios that officers should be tried and prepared for. Three other officers did not feel the need to shoot. They should have been equipped with other methods of pacification (taser). If required, they should have shot non-lethally.

&gt;Suicide is a selfish choice

# Oh fuck off.

This attitude *causes more suicide*. It is precisely why there's all this mental health awareness going on, because of dangerous misunderstandings like that. Regardless of how you feel about Scout, your comment is despicable, as is the behavior of each every person who upvoted it.

&gt;Yet, even though suicide causes massive collateral damage, can it really be considered selfish? I have worked with many patients now‚Äîboth civilians and veterans alike‚Äîwho have at times been in suicidal crisis. I would argue that it‚Äôs not a matter of selfishness, based on the following observations.  
&gt;  
&gt;The suicidal mode is an altered state of consciousness. When a person is battling with their demons and feeling hopeless, their thinking is often significantly distorted. They do not see reality the way they would if they were not in suicidal crisis. Their thoughts loop on the theme of how they are a burden to those they love.

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.""

comments,"&gt; But Scout was shot in the heart. That is so targeted and deadly.

Targeting the heart is as difficult as targeting a ""non-lethal"" (sic) area, and just like the latter, targeting the heart isn't a thing.  Shots are aimed at ""center mass"" and, yes, the heart is near-center-mass, but the heart itself isn't the target.

Why center mass?  The area is much larger, thus misses are less likely, which is important not only for stopping the target, but also preventing ricochets and hits on unintended people/objects.  The area is thicker, thus overpenetration/pass-through is less likely, and thus the likelihood of unintended hits on non-target people/objects are further reduced.

&gt; If required, they should have shot non-lethally.

What is a ""non-lethal"" (sic) shot?  At the ground?  Definitely not -- ricochets can (and do) kill people regularly.  At the leg?  Definitely not -- assuming the leg is hit, the likelihood of hitting the femoral artery is high and has a very high fatality rate.

comments,"I don't believe that GTPD ""executed"" Scout, Scout's death was likely not what they wanted that night, so I disagree with that characterization. Could it have been handled in such a way that Scout was still alive? Possibly, but at this point that's speculation. 

That being said, it's been a while since we've had any debate of what's free speech on campus and it's interesting that the post that gets upvoted a ton is saying that uncomfortable speech from the left isn't free speech (to be clear, the standard for fighting words is very high and this would almost certainly not meet it), yet the reaction is usually very different going the other way.

I think you also misunderstand the point of a protest, it's often supposed to be inconvenient or disruptive. I'd say this is pretty tame in comparison to other methods discussed, such as blocking the road in a protest. Speaking in a broader sense as I can't say what's the view of individuals in this sub, it's often that such protests are roundly criticized when they happen in the US yet are hailed as heroic in other places (for example Hong Kong where protesters shut down the streets, train stations, and airport).",negative,-0.2669,neutral,0.020145396825396823,10/01/2019

Maybe the students don't fully understand how it works - the corporations *pay GT* for the right to sell high-priced swill to a captive audience. I'm pretty sure no one's listening to arguments, moral entreaties, or student rage. Bud Peterson heard the campus request for in-house, GT-run dining services, and he went and took Aramark's money anyway. Because doing it correctly and respectfully is hard and expensive, and selling you out to a jailhouse chow-line looks like a budgetary win on paper. With the State Legislature whining about ""how much money colleges are spending"" it's really easy to just sell you out, take the gold star, and forget about the students who get shafted.

Platforms have to look at their target audience and population, and make decisions that make it easier to survive. Especially with the rise of cancel culture.

It's easier to shut down any controversial discussions - especially around topics like Scout - because it's just too large of a media shitpot at the moment. No one needs some random bloggers picking this up and making r/gatech out to be the next 4chan.

I think the more important thing I did, however, was before I started writing down math I wrote down either a paragraph or a numbered list, in full sentences, detailing my exact plan of approach for solving the problem. Especially on the practice tests, this forced me to recognize when I didn't truly understand a concept; it also helped me reinforce the concepts I already knew.

About chances, ask yourself some questions. Are you in-state? (biggest advantage) Are you female and interested in engineering/Cs? Those affect the admissions bar greatly.

If you can sell it as just a game of playing the registration system and finding what really interests you, then why would a company care, as long as your GPA is good in the classes you finish and you actually graduate. 

In the very very rare situation that a company would 

1.) Ask for your full transcript 

2.) Actually look at it beyond GPA and making sure you graduated 

3.) Know what Ws are

4.) Care about a few Ws out of the many courses you took

5.) Put in all that effort but don't ask you about it and instead instantly disqualify you for the job...

MRDC Bathroom: top choice, but mostly because as a girl there's not too much traffic &amp; I'm always there anyways

Bench outside MRDC on that weird gravel path: pretty isolated, nice ambiance but GTPD has approached me several times to ask if I'm alright

Tech Tower bathrooms on the 1st floor: bougie af. probably messes with their vibe but it's a great experience-gotta stay quiet though

Stairs beside stadium/Bill Moore: less luxury and privacy but it's often possible to plop down on a cement stair/ledge and have a ponder and a sob

Peter's Parking deck, willage parking deck: not too much traffic, worry about getting mugged at night but usually a good place to find an unoccupied corner. A few benches on the willage one too.

Student competition center after hours, invention studio after hours: it usually dies down late at night so if you have access...use it. But-don't use power tools or solder while crying-done that, have scars to prove it-not worth it

CRC, top corner exercise bike on 5th floor: if you're quietly sobbing and facing the corner no one will confront you

**some controversial hot takes:**

clough roof: yes it's too busy. But if you have no shame, it's a very cathartic experience-can be disappointing if you want to go there at night and forget it's locked

the alley behind all the frat houses by the ID building: I don't know the actual name of this area but it's a nice crying pit stop if you're going from Tech square to west campus

in a professor's office hours: They hate it and think you're faking for sympathy but sometimes you truly cannot control it. Would recommend working on self control but if the only option is not going to office hours or crying during office hours and you need to learn the material...just do it. 100% of my 1st semester professors saw me cry.

The smoking hallway in Skiles 2nd floor, the armchair hallway on the 3rd floor (right across from the Skiles walkway), after dark, is solid.

comments,"I asked my advisor about the crazy low graduation rate for AE's and she said that was due to incoming freshman who didn't know what they wanted to major in being afraid that putting Undecided would hurt their application chances.  She said a surprising amount picked the first one alphabetically (which didn't sound real to me but my freshman year I met three AEs who changed their major for that exact reason) and then she laughed and said it doesn't matter because Tech doesn't consider major on the applications.

Why don't you read actual accounts of former GT employees instead of the words that GT spits out?

basically it's embedded in engineering culture that everyone needs to be sad, stressed, overworked, and generally feel awful. Students' who don't feel that way actually end up feelign stressed that they are NOT feeling that way and so must be doing something wrong.

It's a negative feedback loop that only students can change, but faculty and staff can help with. For example - see the signs that got put up about mental health and the almost universally negative reaction here.

comments,"Really depends on how good your work ethic is and how driven you are to succeed at Georgia Tech. If you're willing to make sacrifices and avoid the vices that would sidetrack your academic career (drinking, smoking, the like) then you'll be okay. 

Tech is a crucible. You will be tested in ways you have (likely) never been. If you make the decision to succeed in spite of that, you will come out stronger than you could have possibly imagined. It is difficult, it is grueling, and there will be moments of emotional (and physical) exhaustion. It's all worth it.

That all said, you will have free time. There's tons of clubs and cool people on campus, and whatever your interests are, you'll be in a prime position to explore them. GT isn't a party school, so if you want that, this isn't the place for you. But I'm a PhD student doing full time classwork and research, and I still have enough free time to hang out with the boys, go on dates, and help run one of the clubs.

Sleep: A bad mattress can ruin your life. If you think your mattress is the culprit, try getting a mattress topper that either makes it firmer or softer to sleep on. Additionally, sleep on your back. If you're a side/belly sleeper, sleeping on your back might give you relief within a day or two.

Exercise:  Take care of yourself. Do stretches that help your lower back and resistance exercises that help your core (i.e. abs and lower back).

comments,"Maybe that's the angle you want to take on your essay, figuring out as you go and being open-minded to the fact that you don't know what you don't know. The thing about going to college is that while students pick a major and think they know what they want and where they're headed with it, when they actually get there they are exposed to ideas and opportunities they didn't know existed, and they find other things that pique a new interest or discover new skills that they are really good at.  These can be through classes, or student organizations, or from interacting with the variety of people they meet. Maybe these things will relate to your major or maybe not at all, because college is your best chance for self-discovery, and to learn for the sake of learning, not to just do stuff for building a resume and landing a job. Even though you are sure of what you want your degree to be in and (hopefully) have the discipline to stay the course and work hard to accomplish it, it sounds like you are open to a broad range of opportunities because you never know where they will lead, Your go-with-the-flow perspective is genuine, which always makes a better essay IMO.",positive,0.9756,positive,0.23623737373737372,10/03/2019

comments,"A reasonable question, I don't think you're ignorant!  

Number one, the vast majority of graduate students are barred from participation in the athletic programs funded by this fee per NCAA rules, which mandate that a student's eligibility to compete expires five years from when they started undergrad (meaning most grad students are only eligible for their first year).

Number two, those not participating in athletics can take advantage of this fee by attending ticketed sporting events free of charge.  I am speaking anecdotally here and don't have numbers to back it up, but I believe graduate students more often than not don't attend and furthermore aren't interested in attending these events.  Attending sporting events was an integral part of my undergraduate experience at the University of Florida (and that's where my sports loyalties still lie), but I've never felt the same kind of connection with or passion for my graduate institution, and I think many others feel the same way.  There are also many more international grads than undergrads, and while some of them may develop a passion for GT athletics, the majority are completely uninterested.

Number three, and this is more of a general opinion not related to the grad vs. undergrad distinction, I don't think that big-time athletic programs that bring in tens of millions of dollars in revenue and pay their coaches absurd amounts of money deserve a financial crutch from students.  Here's a good (though a bit dated) [article on the subject](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/why-students-foot-the-bill-for-college-sports-and-how-some-are-fighting-back/2015/11/30/7ca47476-8d3e-11e5-ae1f-af46b7df8483_story.html).",positive,0.9685,positive,0.2217391304347826,10/03/2019

comments,"To graduate with a double major in CS, you would complete the non-cs degree requirements first, then declare the secondary major through the same process as changing your major. Be prepared for a lot of classes though, not too much overlap. 
See here for more on that: https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/college-advising

I don‚Äôt think you can find separate statistics about people who get into scheller since tech‚Äôs admission process is to the institute not specific colleges, so you essentially have the same odds of getting in regardless of what your major is (unless something changed). They do consider your enthusiasm for the major you checked though. I suppose that means the overall first year profile would then be the best place to look if you‚Äôre trying to figure out the admission stats.

I think that in recent years, people are less savvy, less aware, and less likely to take positive action now that they're saturated and fatigued with this constant knowledge that data-hoarding authorities keep losing control over that data. 

And I also blame the rise of bullying platforms like Facebook, Adobe, O365, etc, that take your control away to such a degree that people are just used to letting the platform shape 100% of their participation. When you get prompted for sign-ins, personal data, etc -- let's face it, you probably just automatically start typing (real, accurate) things into whatever blank spaces pop up. People do this without even thinking, these days. It drives me nuts to watch. And they don't even bother to come up with fake data. It's crazy.

That does not translate into being less affected, though. It just means you get to be surprised when the consequences land.

* If you own any electronic devices, you need to learn how to actually use them, not just how to click on stuff that the OEMs are trying to sell you. The number of people who can't even tell me what Android is (""I think I have a Samsung?"" or better yet, ""Yeah, I know what kind of phone I have! It's T-Mobile!"") is worrying.

* It's a good idea to know how common scams work. [The FTC site is an excellent resource.](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/scam-alerts)

* Maybe 80% of the people to whom I've shown https://haveibeenpwned.com had *no idea they even had an account* at some random site that subsequently lost their password. ""I signed up for LinkedIn?"" and ""No, I never had a Zomato account!"" And I'm like, yes, you totally did, because you gave them a password. Then criminals got it from them. 

* 2FA your everything. FYI, if you have the Duo app because of GT, [you can also use it to secure many other accounts as well.](https://guide.duo.com/third-party-accounts)

*  ""I don't sign up for, or into, things."" 
    As the nice video taught us, don't give out your info. What that means for the everyday user: do NOT fill in blanks in websites or apps. You can make exceptions, but it should be a small whitelist of vetted services you're well familiar with. 
   I don't care if you ""need to register to see what [someone you know] seems to be trying to send you."" Now, sure, sometimes the site is legit-ish, but your first instinct should always be to get mad and assume a scam is happening.

Keep an open mind to different colleges and majors, keep your grades up and start early with SAT/ACT prep. Also choose extracurricular activities that you want to do because you would enjoy them, not just because you think they would help you get into Tech. 

Most importantly, try to develop good time management habits - work hard in your classes, get enough sleep, and allow time to relax and have some fun every day. You sound very smart, but if school is coming easy for you now, there will come a time when it won't and you will have to know how to learn when things start getting hard and you don't get it right away anymore.

Don't compare yourself to others, because everyone has a different process and background. Happiness, sanity and self acceptance all have value. Setbacks happen all the time. Failures happen all the time. You all have a talent to offer a perspective employer (lol who cares?), a future partner or contribution to make the world better. Life happens in teams for reasons. 

You will get there. Slow down and don't beat on yourselves. The world is a challenging place, across the board. Depression, anxiety, feelings of inadequacy are all common. Burn out happens too. Get on your own team. You're awesome. You moved away from home. You choose hard degrees. You took on debt or scholarships. You are taking on challenges to improve yourselves and figure out youselves. You like reading textbooks on packaging (this me, I'm a weirdo) just for fun.

Isolation can amplify depression so talk to people in your classes. Ask other people how their day is going. Do they want to study together. Do other things outside of classes like clubs or the CRC or picnic in Piedmont Park.

Some reporting from other schools of similar size shows 3-6 student die of suicide per year, but again, not that much data. 

Please also consider how factors other than school rigor and mental health resources, or perceptions of those things, affect suicide rates. Eg: it varies dramatically by state, with some states having below 10 per 100,000 and some more than 20. Consider the unique statistics across schools that can also vary wildly like socioeconomic status, foreign population, religion, etc. It‚Äôs just not as simple as saying ‚Äútech doesn‚Äôt care about mental health so we have a higher suicide rate‚Äù. I acknowledge that‚Äôs not at all what you‚Äôre saying, and that we don‚Äôt even factually have a higher suicide rate, but this seems to be the trending rhetoric. So hopefully this gives some perspective.

The fact that they even email us when a student passes shows transparency. I won‚Äôt pretend to know best practices either, but copycat suicides are a very real thing.

Suicide is a public health issue, and it's best tackled from all sides. We are all responsible for the well-being of our community.

If you don't know how to support somebody who is suicidal (or generally having a rough time), if you don't know what to say, where to get help, etc, now is the perfect time to look into it.

I agree that we should strive for the best, but suicide happens and it‚Äôs not in everyone‚Äôs control- whether you want to blame the administration, professors, the competitive culture perpetuated by students, whatever it is. People don‚Äôt kill themselves because of stress alone and generally people don‚Äôt become mentally ill because of stress alone. It‚Äôs a very delicate, nuanced problem.

I  am taking a class this semester and I previously learned the material from a coursera class online in the summer  so I know what going on in the class. A lot of people in the class are confused and I am not surprised the prof just flies through the material and concepts don‚Äôt connect at all. Concepts are not hard but the way they are presented makes everything more confusing then it needs to be and guess what people need to go to class to not learn and then go home/dorm room and learn from other resources that actually make sense. I think you can cover a lot of material if concepts are structured and presented properly to increase the bandwidth of communication rather than just doing a half ass job due to time pressure and keep going back and correct/ refine concepts. I am telling you most of the things I learn are not from GT but other resources and I I wish I didn‚Äôt have to waste my time going to class than study everything again at home or get some goddamn good resources together that you could use year after year

By far the easiest (albeit nontraditional) and most convenient volunteer opportunity for college students is through the Crisis Text Line (https://www.crisistextline.org/), which is the largest text-based crisis hotline in the USA. You can volunteer from home at whatever hours are most convenient for you, and they only ask for a 4 hour commitment per week (and to eventually reach 200 hours total). If you need time off or are unable to work regular shifts, they're very understanding. I love this community, and this is the hotline that I choose to continue to work with.

The Trevor Project (which specializes in LGBTQIA+ youth) similarly has a text based service that you can volunteer for: https://www.thetrevorproject.org/get-involved/volunteer/#

If you're looking for a traditional, call-based hotline to work with, do know that those positions come with much more structure and are generally more demanding positions. You'll be working out of a call center, so you'll have to have reliable transportation off campus. NAMI's Georgia Office is looking for volunteers: https://namiga.org/volunteers/.

comments,"I never said there were 6 student suicides last year? 

The leading cause of college student death **on average according to that one paper based on a limited set of data** is accidents, but that doesn't mean it necessarily applies to GT every year. Especially since /u/lmn237 and OP pointed out that not all student deaths are publicized in emails/When the Whistle Blows.

Edit: For example, going by the numbers in my linked study GT had a higher death/suicide rate in [2016](http://web.archive.org/web/20170408211112/https://www.news.gatech.edu/features/when-whistle-blows) (13 students) and [2017.](http://web.archive.org/web/20180802113500/http://www.news.gatech.edu/features/when-whistle-blows) (9 students)

comments,"Hey there, your opinion is a very commonly held one and one that you're definitely welcome to. The general defense to ""involving ourselves"" in the lives and ideology of suicidal folks is that suicidal ideation, depression, and other mental illnesses and disorders cloud and distort thoughts. When somebody is battling tough situation after tough situation, wanting to end all their pain is not only normal but also... expected. It's only normal to want to minimize pain, but it's important to remember that there are many ways to do that (many of which aren't lethal). When you're in a suicidal crisis, suicide seems like the *only* solution--that's a perception and not a reality. If you can move somebody out of that mindset, you can prevent an early death.  For most people, suicide is a temporary problem.

In fact, [90% of people who attempt suicide go on to survive and not die by suicide (and 70% of attempt survivors will never attempt again)](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/survival/). ""This relatively good long-term survival rate is consistent with the observation that **suicidal crises are often short-lived**, even if there may be¬†underlying, more chronic¬†risk factors present that give rise to these crises.""

I'm not sure if that's a good explanation--I'm writing this as I chat with my family--but generally we intervene because, if somebody wants to kill themselves, that's a temporarily held desire. If we can move them away from that mindset, we can more often than not prevent a death and help somebody return to a healthier, happier state.",negative,-0.9952,positive,0.15952674897119343,10/05/2019

I don't think it's fair to blame every suicide on Ma Tech.  People don't kill themselves over just grades, class stress, or general Tech stress.  Believe it or not, suicide is common off this campus, too.  We have no idea what his motivations were nor anyone else that has committed suicide.  Money, personal relationships, family issues, legal trouble, job issues, etc. are common motivating factors.  We'll likely never know what led to this, so why point the finger at Tech?  He could have had the same problems independent of what school he attended.  No one is suggesting that GT isn't stressful, but I've known plenty of GT students capable of navigating some extremely tough classes with little stress while having anxiety attacks over the most benign social situations.

Note: I'm not suggesting GT Counseling has their shit together.  In my opinion, either offer a good service or don't offer it at all.  (Applies to PTS, Housing, and Dining, too.) But, we don't even know if he was on their radar.",negative,-0.7681,neutral,0.047467320261437906,10/06/2019

comments,"I can tell you‚Äôre upset about the way interviews work, and I agree that current industry standard is not ideal in terms of discerning who can write clean code that can scale well over time. I actually discuss this skill with my coworkers a lot - the difference between taking time to architect a solution versus a quick fix to get something working, and how to verify if somebody can do both and know when each is applicable!

But ripping into some kid who has his first interview isn‚Äôt the way to do fix the standard. You‚Äôre very clearly salty about your career and I think you need to sit back and reevaluate yourself. You‚Äôre tearing into some guy who‚Äôs literally asking how to do well on his first interview, not how to develop a scalable app from the ground up.

By your flair I guess you‚Äôre a sophomore, so congrats on the interview! The questions companies ask vary a lot - some are totally non technical, while others like G or FB can ask some real tough ones. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre applying for a Freshman/Sophomore program if you‚Äôre going for one of those though, so it‚Äôll be a bit more manageable.

1332 is great to know DS/A, but the implementation really isn‚Äôt that important for interviews. Try to focus on the usage (I.e. Big O time for each, where they‚Äôre appropriate, etc.) The only implementation based questions you‚Äôd probably get would be linked list based ones (such as write an algo to detect a cycle in a linked list).

I would say your best bet since it‚Äôs close is to try grinding some leetcode easy questions (and maybe a couple mediums if you have time to spare). These questions are most indicative of interviews. When In the interview, don‚Äôt get obsessed by optimizations, first just write something that works! Then optimize. If it‚Äôs non technical, remember the STAR method!

comments,"So this really depends on the kind of company that you're interviewing for.

For BigN and unicorns:

1. Read Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI). This book includes a lot of info on what you should do during an interview and a basic review of data structures. You can find a PDF on the same site where you got your pirated textbooks.
2. Practice coding questions on Leetcode (easys and mediums are usually the kind that show up during interviews). Don't look at the answer or the hints until after you've at least *tried* the problem. Once you've done a couple dozen, start timing yourself to simulate a real interview environment.

For other companies:

Usually small tech companies or non-tech companies will have a more ""informal"" technical interview process. They might ask algorithms questions, or they might ask you the in and outs of various frameworks and languages on your resume, or how you did your side projects. For these kinds of questions, in addition to practicing leetcode, review what you've done on your resume and be comfortable talking about it.

**There is no shame in practicing for technical interviews**

Grinding leetcode questions and reading CTCI does *not* make you a ""hack"" or a ""charlatan"" as others might say, it's a normal and accepted part of the CS interview process.

I did it, my friends who work at BigN companies did it, Google *literally* recommends that you do this. It's totally normal (and for the record, my friends and I are doing fine in the tech industry, even though we needed to practice for our interviews).

Source: Work at BigN company, do interviews for BigN company, have friends who work at BigN companies, have friends who do interviews for BigN companies, have friends/co-workers who do university recruiting for BigN companies.

comments,"**Library Genesis**

Library Genesis or LibGen is a search engine for articles and books on various topics, which allows free access to content that is otherwise paywalled or not digitized elsewhere. Among others, it carries PDFs of content from Elsevier's ScienceDirect web-portal. Many publishers have been accused of immorally benefiting from publicly tax funded works, research papers and textbooks written by professors on public payrolls.Started around 2008 by Russian scientists, it absorbed the contents of, and became the functional successor to, library.nu, which was shut down by legal action in 2012.In 2015, the website became involved in a legal case when Elsevier accused it of providing pirate access to articles and books. In response, the admins accused Elsevier of gaining most of its profits from publicly funded research which should be freely available as they are paid for by taxpayers.

The thing I always keep in the back of my mind when I receive an ‚ÄúIn Memory of‚Äù email is this: every single one of those students had families, friends, and even strangers whose lives they impacted. Sometimes I look back on my day and reflect upon who made me feel even just a bit better, whether through a simple ‚Äúhello‚Äù or a thorough conversation. While I may not have personally known many of the students that we‚Äôve lost during my time here, the loss of their presence on our campus and in our world is felt deeply by many. One of them may have been the guy who smiles at me every day on the way to class, leaving me in a good mood even at 7 AM on a Monday morning. Another may have been the girl that would quietly scribble away at her notes during chemistry class, who I envied for having neater handwriting than I could ever hope to achieve. 
My life has been positively shaped by countless individuals who probably thought that their presence in my life was nothing but a faint imprint that would fade away in a day‚Äôs time. If you ever feel lost, just know that you even just being here helps so many others, whether it‚Äôs being their go-to during times of trouble or a source of familiarity on a campus that can be overwhelming at times. Never underestimate your impact in the world, nor the one that you have the potential to make. If you ever begin to doubt it, feel free to reach out to me.

comments,"You say that you don't feel like you have a perfect life. What would an actual perfect life look like to you? What would make you feel satisfied and filled inside?

Life is hard. But there are so many opportunities for joy and happiness all around. And if you're current situation isn't conducive to experiencing things that bring you joy, then think about how you can change it. By no means am I discounting difficult life situations, but most people have the opportunity to change something about their situation. Keep looking until you don't feel the emptiness inside.

Hackerrank is good too but I think the problem statements are kind of wordy and leetcode is closer to what you will probably be asked.

If the job you are applying for has language specifications, I would also recommend looking up popular interview questions for said language.  Another thing you should consider for your interviews is that luck is a huge factor and often times there will be other factors that are out of your control such as your interviewer having other things going on in his or her personal or work life. I used to treat all of my interviews like it was life or death (exaggerating) and leading up to each one, I would do nothing but think about it. I have found I do much better when I do not stress about interviews too much and just try to do my best. If it doesn't work out then the opportunity wasn't meant to be.

comments,"The feeling of emptiness/lack of purpose in the face of otherwise positive circumstances is often a hallmark sign of depression. I know other people who have had the same sorts of thoughts, and many people go through the process of blaming their feelings on a philosophical worldview, or an ingratitude for the good things they have in life, before they go and reach out for psychiatric help. Sometimes the issue is that a person doesn't find meaning in their job/education and feel empty because of a lack of purpose, but other times it's because there's a chemical imbalance.

I'm not saying that you have depression, and I'm definitely not claiming to be qualified to even recommend getting checked out for it. But I know people who had these same issues because of a late-onset depressive disorder, who went and saw a doctor and are now doing almost completely fine on a single medication.

You may not see the immediate impact of your current research, but that does not mean it will not have a positive effect on the world in the future. There are many opportunities, however, where you can see the impact of your work almost immediately. Think about what brings you joy and satisfaction and then try to find things that fill you in that way. Volunteering, whether with the young, less advantaged, or elderly, with animals or with a cause near and dear to your heart, can be extremely gratifying and might help you see your purpose. You DO have purpose. It‚Äôs just a little harder for most to find. Fortunately, there are likely many in your community, familiar faces and strangers, who will be happy to help you on your journey - that might just be their purpose.

comments,"OP - sorry to hear about what you are going through.  there are plenty of good replies already, so at the risk of sounding trite, let me add something from a different perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

are you staying physically active?  i'm a big believer in exercising regularly - some cardio, resistance training, flexibility/yoga, etc.  there are plenty of physical benefits, but associated mental benefits as well.  I won't say this will turn things around for you definitively, but if it's not a part of your life now, it's worth a shot.  give it a good 4-6 weeks, 3-5 times a week.  (I'd go so far as to say it's even worth shaving a BIT of sleep time from your schedule to get a regular workout in.)

&amp;#x200B;

be sure to couple the above with a healthy diet (reduce or remove refined sugars) and be sure to take meaningful, deep breaths, not shallow ones.  doesn't have to be every breath, but be sure to incorporate some serious, mindful deep breathing throughout your day.

&amp;#x200B;

finally, as others have said, try to step back and appreciate the small things about each day to be grateful for, e.g., Atlanta sun shining down on your face, the smile from a stranger when you hold the door for him/her, a genuine exchange with a friend that makes you both laugh a deep laugh.  

&amp;#x200B;

if it all gets too much to handle, do reach out to someone.  every life is a precious one.

&amp;#x200B;

hang in there; clearly you have others, strangers even, pulling for you.

comments,"I actually will counter some of the other viewpoints on here and say that I think your successes are catalyzing you up the pyramid and you're a bit depressed because you haven't figured out where to go with it. That's all right. You are allowed to feel like ""What is the fucking point?"" Everyone does sometimes. You don't sound despondent to me, but I will say don't glamorize suicide when there is so much fun to be had in self discovery.

You have some of your processes ironed out such as academically, financially, and socially, so now your mind is going on a vector of what is my actual purpose? This is a great question to have! It lets you reflect on your values and what you actually want.  It's easier to get trapped in, why do I even give a shit to continue contributing to this world. Challenge yourself to look internally and figure out your drive vectors. This is not easy to do. Therapy can assist this process, because it force you to have conversations with someone while you figure this out. I'd encourage you to try it.

When you started on this process, did you have an end game or something you were pursuing? Did you go to grad school to get a better job or learn or just because you had the grades and it seemed like a logical progression? What was your motivation when you started and how does that initial motivation align with what your experiences have brought you? Did your values change? When you got your ""primary"" processes (social, financial, academic) figured out, did you start any exploration into new hobby or leisure or social pursuits? Do you want to be a parent? Do you want to volunteer? Do you want to support people entering sciences? What things that grant you your successes can you give back to others who haven't had similar stability points? This is what leadership is.

[https://immoderatestoic.com/what-is-stoicism](https://immoderatestoic.com/what-is-stoicism)

To answer a question you asked below on how we (I'll answer for myself only) keep going.

I learned along time ago that I like people and I want to be nice and benevolent as much as possible, even if it makes others think I'm weak or I get walked on sometimes. Whatever, I don't have to engage in negativity because I'm negative myself. I want the world to be less of a shitshow, so I'm going to contribute in small ways. Simple shit makes me happy. I like helping people and hearing conflicting view points. I get fulfillment out of relieving stress from my colleagues who are awesome with lots of different walks of life and challenges, but who also help me. I like the mission of my work, now. (The corporate world can be about as soulsucking as it gets). I like taking bare minimum supplies into the woods alone, walking for a long time, thinking and camping. My family members think I'm insane sometimes when I go off grid alone as a chick (Thank god for PLBs!), but I want to test my boundaries and hangout in nature. I want to cat sit for my friends. I want to pay taxes and support education. (I need to volunteer more... :( )

To answer your question, there is no tangible prize. It's all a value assessment, based on your self assigned values. Do you want to be the richest? Go get it. Do you want to be a simple, arguably boring person and just laugh at shit then try to move things forward? Welcome to my party. Do you want to be the subject matter expert? Cool, go get your role on.",positive,0.9984,neutral,0.023711319544652887,10/07/2019

I tried to kill myself, but I couldn't follow through because I was left with one final question: Is there something besides the emptiness?

I tried drugs to help. Alcohol. Self harm. None of it sparked anything inside of me.

I went to a psychiatric hospital and looked for help there.

It's been a rough road, let me tell you, but it's been worth it. Two years later and I can feel again. Sadness, anger, disgust. But also joy, love, and thankfulness. 

The emptiness doesn't last forever.

Please don't go out alone. Please talk to someone. Reach out for help. You are your greatest advocate. Hell, if you can't do it let someone else reach out for help in your stead. But don't let the emptiness be the last thing you feel. We need you to be okay. We want you to be okay.

comments,"Why do you want to study your chosen major at Georgia Tech, and what opportunities at Georgia Tech will prepare you in that field after graduation?*


Ever since I was an elementary school student, I built from scratch gumball machines, pinball machines, foosball tables, and even Rube Goldberg machines out of standard lego blocks. I enjoyed making things work better by modifying these interrelated mechanisms. Therefore, I want to apply my observant and creative thinking to higher-leverage situations of medicine, which involves the workings of the human body and helping people. 
This brings me now to my future studies, where if I enjoy learning the way these toys work, then I would like to understand the way how large-scale systems work. My interests in science may lead me to focus on Biology, where I can learn about the internal functions and equilibrium in the human body. Or I could troubleshoot issues underneath the skin by identifying bone fractures, and make modifications and improvements to damaged body parts, and organs with man-made materials, like a surgeon.
There are three unique features of Georgia Tech that can help me achieve these goals. First, I was really intrigued by Georgia Tech‚Äôs Student Hospital Connections. Becoming a member of this pre-health organization would allow me to obtain valuable experiences in two of Atlanta‚Äôs largest hospitals: Grady Memorial Hospital and Atlanta Medical Center. Secondly, I believe the American Medical Student Association can be an invaluable resource to help me reach medical school. It's a focused program where I can learn about the internal functions and equilibrium in the human body. AMSA can even provide me with a variety of great programs, including mentoring with upperclassmen, volunteer opportunities around Atlanta, and even job shadowing. Thirdly, the Students for One Health club will help integrate my passion in environmental science into public health. This collaborative concept will help provide me with elaborative workshops, community service, and health workshops with physicians to support interest in global health.",positive,0.9945,positive,0.15694444444444447,10/07/2019

They can only make up new rules for USG units, not private entities who happen to own land on or near USG campuses.

comments,"&gt;What are some actual solutions for therapy or when I'm feeling suicidal that have helped other people?

That's certainly the million dollar question. I'll break this answer down into the classic therapy options and the non-therapy options.

When it comes to therapy for suicidal thoughts and other mental illnesses, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is arguably the most common type of therapy provided today. CBT, in short, focuses on how thoughts influence feelings and behaviors (and vice versa) and attempts to retrain the way you think about scenarios and restructure negative thoughts into positive ones. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a branch of CBT that is very structured (four modules: interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, and mindfulness) and adds an additional focus on acceptance and validation. These are generally two effective types of therapy that lots of people undergo for a variety of mental illnesses. These are obviously long-term therapy options that I'm not entirely sure our Counseling Center at Tech can offer (our Center on campus focuses on short-term counseling, not long-term therapy). That said, many staff members at the Counseling Center have a PhD or equivalent degree and know a lot about these therapies and can offer more guidance about what third party services near Tech might be available to you.

Therapy is obviously expensive and time-consuming. For a lot of people, professional therapy simply isn't an option, so let's look into some short-term solutions for when suicidal thoughts pop up. In crisis counseling, we focus a lot on identifying coping strategies and support networks. If you're suicidal, you're in a state of crisis. The long-term goal is of course to solve the underlying issues that are causing the suicidal feelings, but before you can get there you first have to get out of crisis, from a hot moment to a cool one, if you will. Coping strategies look different for everybody, but, in short, your goal is to identify some small task that you can do to keep yourself busy, bring yourself a little bit of joy, or feel empowered. Some folks like going for a walk, others enjoy making their bed or listening to music. Journaling, drawing, playing video games, texting a friend, and watching TV are other common ones. Coming up with good, healthy coping skills takes time. If you're struggling to find some that work for you, [here's a list of 99 different ones](http://www.yourlifeyourvoice.org/pages/tip-99-coping-skills.aspx) to get your brain thinking. If you struggle with finding healthy coping mechanisms and instead find yourself relying on harmful coping mechanisms (self harm, for example), [a good set of alternative coping mechanisms can be found here](http://www.selfinjury.bctr.cornell.edu/documents/distraction-tech-and-alts.pdf).

The shitty part about all of this is that it takes time to develop good skills that work for you. Time is, unfortunately, not something a lot of us Tech students have lying around, but if you can devote just 10 minutes a day to a healthy coping strategy (and/or a new activity like meditation or writing down 2 reasons why today was a good day), you're doing more than you were before. It's ok to start small and build your way up--that's how we all do it. Don't beat yourself up if it takes some, or a lot of, time.

And as a last note, make sure that your physical health is well before working on your mental health. You'd be surprised how often three meals, decent sleep, a regular cup of water throughout the day, and standing up every now and then does for some folks. This isn't to say that you need to head to the CRC and lift 4 days a week, but if your body feels physically bad, looking into ways to alleviate that physical need first is a great place to start.",positive,0.9382,positive,0.13466127727491367,10/08/2019

I agree with a lot of what you said at the end of this post. Progress in the professional and administrative department is slow, so for the time being a lot of the hard work falls to us. That's not to say that there's no hope--the very fact that we can have this discussion means that the culture at Tech is slowly changing, and the general outpouring of support on mental health posts the past few days shows how many students care and are willing to give each other the support we all need.

We need better counselors and mental health providers at Georgia Tech. Good on you for keeping on even when things seem so overwhelming - I know how it is to feel depressed and overwhelmed at Tech and it's hard to get out of the funk. It can be worth it to stick it out here - as a graduate, most of my friends have been able to find really good jobs just with the GT name. And these years you can also make some of the best friends you'll have in life. Joining clubs can help if you haven't done that. There's bound to be a group that fits your interests here. For me it was Cru and GT Wushu.

I will say that with a suicide attempt, GT probably has a protocol to keep you safe. And that means the unpleasant inconvenience of sending you to a facility. They had no idea if you were to actually take your life and they don't want that to happen and the way that they can control for that is  by having you in a controlled environment for a bit. It sucks, but who knows if they stopped you from doing something bad?

comments,"A very similar thing happened to me back in 2012. This is not new.  I got sent to Ridgeview (I was threatened with a squad car but I told them my boyfriend could drive me).  No matter how much I told the doctor at Tech that I wanted to get better, that I didn't want to kill myself - that I just thought about it all the time - wasn't good enough for her.  When I got to Ridgeview, I was put in a concrete room with no windows.  It felt like prison.  Thankfully, I managed to convince them I didn't want to kill myself and that I wanted to get better, so I didn't have to 'stay the night'.  When I asked if they had long-term treatment, they told me all they did was week-long classes and that I'd have to find someone else to treat me long-term.  So I was stuck.  I'd finally reached out to someone to get better, and they'd just dumped me at an asylum.  

What I learned from my experience is to never tell a counselor, therapist, or doctor you are suicidal.  Most places just won't help you.  They will tell you to call a hotline, or to call emergency services, but they just don't want to deal with you. Its just the way it is.",positive,0.3295,positive,0.2484848484848485,10/08/2019

comments,"I've gone to therapy with extra clothes/etc already and this post just reinforced that my fears were justified. I'm never like...explosively suicidal though, and I'm rarely a risk since my preferred method is pretty inaccessible, but I've definitely come close to being comitted. I'd honestly rather die though, 10-13 and similar laws are inhumane and should be illegal. If I had to choose between myself or a loved one being subjected to that or comitting suicide, I would choose to let them/myself do it. To think otherwise is selfish. This is also why I hate the push for suicide hotlines over the past couple years and will never call out without taking the necessary steps to make my location/identity hidden.

I think I've stopped seeing suicide as an absolute evil to be avoided at all costs. I genuinely think there are people who are simply not compatible with the world. I don't know if I'm one of them, but I'm confident they exist. Can I live with myself knowing my inability to live without someone subjected them to suffering they could have avoided?

However, there is a key difference between undergraduate and graduate students. Graduate students are almost all employees of the university, and many generate a significant amount of money for the university (through conducting research). Despite this, graduate students aren't fairly compensated for their work (the argument being that our degree is part of our compensation -- which is silly for many of the same reasons athletes not getting paid by the NCAA is silly). Most graduate students make around 30,000 a year. Making them pay 10% of this income in student fees is crazy.

comments,"I agree with you regarding the transportation and technology fees--either everyone should have to pay in or they should be optional for everyone.  I don't have much of a background in economics, but it appears to me that both of these fees fund public goods that benefit many members (both undergraduate and graduate) of the campus community in a non-discriminatory way.  The best way to collect them kinda depends on how you feel about socialism--would you rather have everyone divvy up the cost, resulting in lower (but mandatory) fees, or let those who use it pay (substantially more per person) for it?  I lean towards the socialist policy for these two fees.

The athletic fee is different because NCAA rules preclude most graduate students from participating.  Your eligibility to compete on an NCAA-sanctioned team expires 5 years after you started on your undergraduate degree, meaning most graduate student athletes are ineligible after their first year (and probably used up their 4 years of eligibility in undergrad anyway, making it a moot point).  So the question becomes why are grad students helping to pay for programs they are barred from participating in?  I'm also less inclined to embrace a socialist policy for athletics because I don't see them as a ""public good"" in the same way that technology and transportation are.  The athletic department also generates quite a bit of revenue on its own and doesn't, in my opinion, need nor merit financial help from the student body.",positive,0.9007,positive,0.3055555555555555,10/08/2019
comments,"No. This is not an institutional policy. This is standard policy for dealing with mental health issues who call in this state of crisis. Also the OP is factually wrong in that a hold is mandatory. The attending at Grady refused to formally admit me after a nurse tried to 10-13 me when I tried to leave. They kicked me over to GT psychiatry instead for outpatient. But the cop cars rides do happen. I was threatened with arrest if I did not voluntarily go in an ambulance. If you resist certain help, they will make choices for you.

I am also a primary source. Please listen to me when I say that it sucks that this is the state of things, but scaring people off isn't a great process either. I am happy the OP is transparent, my posts are also in my history around this issue. I am a better person for doing this because it absolved a lot of my fear of certain things, such as OP's like telling my family and actively seeking therapy myself.

Remember that we love you guys. Also I'll second the Alumni response which is GT needs to figure out their counseling center and psychiatry or they won't be getting money from me.

Also, talking about these issues allow removal of the stigma. I took two mental health days last week and while I don't advertise it, I am in a place where this is more supported. Being human is allowed. Taking a day off to hang out with your kids is allowed. Keep fighting for environments like this. Be nice to people. Remember that Millennials like myself are working towards better working environments.

I got fired because I stood up for myself because chronic insomnia and depression issues will always be things I have to deal with. I want to deal with them and I'm happy to be here. I also told a manager to ""do whatever he had to do"" after I was direct with him that I was struggling and he took me to HR like a little child on his last day as my boss. No problem, man.

comments,"I am so sorry this is happening to you. I think it is awful that students are AFRAID to reach out for help. I was afraid and I was blessed with a pretty decent experience (there was only one time --ironically a walk in just like yours -- where someone belittled me/didn't try to help -- I was trying to strangle myself/was hurtting myself by not breathing until I almost pass out and he said 'you know you can't actually kill yourself like that?' and I was horrified and ashamed that my depression wasn't good/server enough)
I feel like teacher-student interactions are the best resource at Tech right now. My teachers were all super understanding and accommodating. HOWEVER, the amount of support you receive from this (in terms of class help, etc) varies widely from department and individuals.
The other thing I will say is I hear fewer complaints about Stamps Psychiatry than the counciling center, so if you are feeling really bad again go there? I have interacted with 3 doctors there (one is no longer there) and 2 nurses/staff there and each one has been kind and supportive way more than counciling was.
So I guess I am changing my verdict: psychiatry might be the best place at Tech and then it's teachers. Which considering we have a counciling center they claim to funnel money into WHY IS IT SO HORRIFICALLY AWFUL?!?!?!
Seriously I hoped after Scout real changes would occur..... And honestly I don't know if any did.... Maybe some teachers became more aware of how widespread the issue is... But that's kinda it.",positive,0.9076,neutral,0.03805114638447971,10/08/2019

comments,"Hey. I want to just talk directly to you and tell you not to be afraid to seek help in any form. This is not a reason to run from seeking help. Remember no one gets through life alone. We are social beings with social purposes. It's a mandatory need. Also GT psychiatrists helped me after a suicide attempt. Not really the counseling center as much but the psychiatrist I saw let me talk and he wrote some funny things about me which I laugh now reading because it was bounded in truth. 

""It's a shame that she never developed a more rounded version of herself."" No worries, Dr. Croft. We are good. You sat with my mother when she didn't understand what was happening because I couldn't tell her. You let me vent about the situation with my parents always being a concern for me. While I still choose to love my father, his severe viewpoint was wrong, often. Facts I only accepted later. Their demands of me, never let me be me. ""She wants to live her life for herself."" Yes, being everyone's empath in my family can be tiring. Literally, all of these people need therapy, but Dr. Dad doesn't believe in it.

I'd challenge everyone ITT to understand that problems like depression, suicidal ideation and anxiety are all problems that benefit from earlier detection and management, just like any other medical condition. If you avoid dealing with certain situations, they can fester. You can all judge away and downvote me. Go for it.

You are an adult. Can you take some of the financial burden in loans? Is it worth it to do so for a social perception? Do you think you would be fine with dorm living for a while? Do you think apartment living is better for you? I like pro/con lists as cheesy as they are. Weigh your decision. Make a choice. Do what works for you. Don't undervalue solo spaces. It's not really a luxury to have your own spot when classes or life gets demanding. It's more or less mandatory.

You'd be amazed that 3k (pretax) is less than two weeks of work for me, less than 5 years out.

I lived in off campus dorms earlier rather than later because financial concerns were always in my mind. ATL has changed ($--&gt;$$$). May be worth it to stay on nowadays.

I lived in the old 4th ward next to project housing and walked 2 miles in daily, but I grew up near ATL and in a less wealthy area so I never was afraid of some of the city life problems. My rent was $300/month. I traded time for finance. I care a lot about finance. Pro/con.

When does it change from awareness to literally contributing to our affliction?

These people could really use someone giving them wisdom about how they made it through a particularly tough time. Instead, these younger students are fed the rhetoric that life here is bound to be depressing and there is very little they can do about it.

There's a lot of horror stories about Home Park, but I've found living here for 4 years to be pretty safe (I live on Atlantic, so I know it's not super deep in the neighborhood and YMMV) and the fact that I'm only paying about $400 a month for a shared room makes any issues pretty much worth it (older/worn down houses, bugs, no central A/C etc.) Think of any tough times you go through right now as a down payment on better times later.

Most places want older folks because the odds are higher that these students will come work full time there. From their point of view, they're investing a lot into interns and if they end up going somewhere else, it's kinda wasted money. They want a good return on investment, which sounds pretty crappy but at the end of the day they're there to make a buck like everyone else.

Keep working hard, you're definitely not doing anything wrong! Leetcode and side projects and a good GPA are all solid ways to attract offers next year or the year after that.

Another piece of advice I'd give you is to look at places that aren't Big Silicon Valley Tech companies. Smaller companies, or even bigger ones that aren't software companies all will very often give you solid experience, and even though they aren't as flashy as the big names, your odds of getting a spot are higher and you'll be able to apply for the big names the following year with actual work experience on your resume. I applied for a FAANG company last year and got rejected, wound up interning at State Farm (which has a not well known but really good internal software engineering/IT department). The FAANG company kept tabs on me, and they actually called me up at the start of the year to get me to apply! I'm currently interviewing with them.

I know you mean well. at least I hope so. but there are other ways to channel your toxic positivity into something more meaningful. i don't want to be mean and assume, but you don't really seem like the kind of guy to empathize with those with depression and anxiety and other mental health concerns. I wish I could say the same. but you have to realize that your bitching about our ""bitching"" isn't going to accomplish anything. 

if you're worried that underclassmen are being fed the rhetoric that mental health issues are a problem here, ***why don‚Äôt you do something to help out?*** overhauling our subpar mental health services is a good place to start. 

I'm only asking you and the people who are doing well mentally because right now, I don't have time to focus on anything else like telling freshmen that's it's gonna be okay or talk to SGA or whoever to improve our mental health initiatives. I don't have time to do any of that because I'm too busy fixing myself and getting by one day at a time.

comments,"I taught a section of GT1000 last year, and we discussed team dynamics. One of the most important things you need to do **AS A GROUP** (and I cannot stress that enough) is laying out ground rules.  We even had our groups make a ""team contract"" that everyone had to agree to and sign.  It covered things like meeting responsibilities, participating fully &amp; professionally, and accepting consequences if not abiding by team rules.  I know it seems like this is super strict and serious, but it is a good jumping off point for groups, especially ones that you don't pick for yourself.  

Sounds like this might be a little late to initiate a team contract, but I wouldn't hesitate going to your instructor.   Depending on how much time you have left until the assignment is due and the time you think it will take to get done, maybe send a final email/message to your group saying that you don't want to have to go to the instructor, but if you don't hear from everyone by X date, you will discuss the situation with him/her. 

As a side note, this basically happened to me while I was an undergrad here, in my senior project class. So I get it. There were four of us, and one person was a total slacker. We carried their weight the first half of the semester, but got sick of it and went to the prof.

comments,"&gt;Another piece of advice I'd give you is to look at places that aren't Big Silicon Valley Tech companies. Smaller companies, or even bigger ones that aren't software companies all will very often give you solid experience, and even though they aren't as flashy as the big names, your odds of getting a spot are higher and you'll be able to apply for the big names the following year with actual work experience on your resume. I applied for a FAANG company last year and got rejected, wound up interning at State Farm (which has a not well known but really good internal software engineering/IT department). The FAANG company kept tabs on me, and they actually called me up at the start of the year to get me to apply! I'm currently interviewing with them. Definitely don't discount the little/not well known names.

comments,"Are you actually kidding? Characterizing Carter's strategic decision to support El Salvadorean death squads wasn't a mistake, it was a calculated effort to suppress guerrilla rebel efforts and protect American interests in the region. He knew damn well what he was doing and willingly did it anyways. It's not some fucking mistake like forgetting to turn the oven off. He knew exactly where his money was going, and he gave that money anyways. Do a little research before you casually excuse the deaths of 75,000+ Salvadorean citizens as ""a mistake"".

In 1980, Archbishop of San Salvador √ìscar Romero [wrote a letter to Carter](http://www.justpeace.org/romeroletter.htm), discussing the actions taken by the government, urging Carter to not support the right-wing regime. Carter's response? Instead of heeding Romero's pleas, his administration asked the Catholic Church to ask Romero to tone down the rhetoric. Weeks later, Romero was assassinated by the regime, and at his funeral, 30-50 people died as the regime fired upon mourners from the national palace. In the face of overwhelming violence from the El Salvadorean government, Carter knowingly continued military and financial support. Your ignorance is on full display if you think you can characterize Carter's role as that of, at best, an unknowing bystander.

If you think that a man capable of knowingly arming a paramilitary regime dedicated to suppressing their opposition with extreme violence is someone who deserves to be celebrated for ""philanthropy and charity"", that's crazy. I don't give a shit how many houses he built, he helped murder people. That's not ""some irrelevant negative bullshit"" that he ""may have done"", it's established. Curb stomping someone's head in and turning around and giving a dollar to charity doesn't excuse the fact that you're a criminal. A man's character can only be judged at its worst, and at his worst, Carter enabled war criminals and unheralded massacres.

I will give you this, Carter absolutely has an unending desire for charity - charity to right wing governments willing to massacre their own populace to maintain their power.",negative,-0.8907,neutral,-0.01663566468253969,10/09/2019

comments,"Thanks for doing this! I'd also like to point out to those who may be unfamiliar with graduate student pay, how the taxes for grad students income/tuition/fees work. The state/federal government sees our income/stipends as taxable, while tuition which is paid by our funding department/organization is not seen as taxable income. Student fees are NOT counted toward tuition. While we get taxed for \~30k in income per year (though grad pay ranges form 24k-34k by department/fellowship) , the university REQUIRES us to pay student fees (\~3k) out of our student stipends. SO while our actual before-tax income pay is \~27K once we pay student fees, we still get taxed for the full 30k. This also means that 10% of most graduate students annual budgets go entirely to student fees. Graduate school is a full-time job, so while some of us may be able to get extra income from side hustles or part-time work, this is not reasonable for everyone. After tax, grad students take home just about $2k/month. That's $2k/month for rent, groceries, insurance, utilities, healthcare, and any other mandatory expenses. If student fees are treated the same way as tuition payments and paid by the funding organization, then grad students would take home $230 more per month. That's significant when your monthly budget is as tight as ours.  


Bonus: They don't tell us this, you have to find it for yourself, but if grad students submit a 1098-T tax form, then you can deduct student fees from your tax return under the ""Life Time Learning Credit"". HOWEVER, the life time learning credit is only deductible up to $2k/per tax return which is still less than the student fees...",positive,0.8016,positive,0.126984126984127,10/09/2019

They announced during opening ceremonies when/how team formation was going to happen. Worry not, they'll make sure you know!

GT is one of the only schools that forces graduate students with GTA/GRA/GA positions to pay mandatory tech/transport/athletic fees.  


The main reason why the tech and transport fees make no g.damn sense is we have to technically use those things just to do our job. So, by paying those fees out of our stipends, we're paying to be able to do our jobs.

Both the ideas and the words are considered intellectual property.

When citing long portions of text verbatim (such as an entire paragraph), most style manuals have specific specs for such long quotes. Often you're supposed to create an indented paragraph for the quote.

Saying ""as described in the textbook..."" followed immediately by the *exact words* from the textbook without quotation marks gives the appearance that you're paraphrasing (using someone else's *ideas* but your own *words*).

From reading OP's comments, I don't feel there was necessarily bad intent, but if OP is graduating now, I find it difficult to believe they are not clear yet on what constitutes plagiarism.

That being said, it sounds like you at least tried and made a mistake (at least from the information you have given us here). Technically, all plagiarism and cheating is supposed to be reported to OSI. However, most professors/TAs aren't likely to do this in most cases because it can be a very long and drawn out progress for the student. I would think a 0 for the entire project is very harsh and I consider myself pretty harsh, having given out 100s of zeros for cheating/plagiarism in the past. I would try talking to the professor contritely in person and apologize for it and see if you can get at least partial credit given you. It's important you learn from this but the punishment should also be reasonable.

I doubt OSI would give you worse than a 0 on the assignment, especially for a first offense. Though I hear they take a long time to deliberate, so that may affect your graduation plans.",negative,-0.922,neutral,0.017,10/10/2019

You should expect a case interview, and they're not going to give you more information in advance (I've had other case interviews where I was instructed to prepare something, it's not like that). There will be some simple math involved like multiplication and percentages and all stuff that's within your capabilities as a GT engineering student. Like most case interviews, they care about your reasoning, and they're typically okay if you don't always give direct yes or no answers as long as you explain (""well it depends because option a would be better in scenario x but option b would be better in scenario y""). During my interview they were pretty forgiving about minor math errors or me needing to pause and think since they didn't give me the case in advance, but just make sure to think out loud as much as you can.

Delta Chi stays away from calling our new members pledges and calls them AMs (Associate Members) instead. We changed the name to make a point that our new members are treated with respect. We have a strict policy against hazing, and it is never allowed. If you haze someone, you get kicked out. Even more important, everyone in our Chapter agrees that hazing with alcohol is wrong, and that it has no place at GT. We work really hard to create a responsible social environment where that doesn‚Äôt happen.

At the undergraduate level, it provides a good introduction to a wide range of topics that are necessary in robotics (artificial intelligence, perception, computer vision, embedded systems). Threads are customizable, so ymmv. Keep in mind that a nontrivial portion of your college experience should come out of pursuits outside of coursework, so I highly recommend exploring your interests through research and extracurriculars as well!",positive,0.9521,positive,0.13854166666666662,10/11/2019

Network, network, network.

Go meet people and talk to them. If you got friends with internships / jobs. Hang out with them and see if they can help you put your foot in the door.

The older you get, the more you'll realize that getting a real job that you'll actually love is all about knowing the right people and having the timing work out when your skills and needs align. The more you network, the more those opportunities appear, and the less the timing matters, because everyone will be trying to hire you as your network grows.

You come out of GT with 3 internships, no one will even ask you about your GPA.

I didn't have AP CS offered at my high school, so I had pretty much no CS background coming in (you're already ahead of a few of us!). I struggled quite a bit during my 1st year and some of my 2nd year with the CS curriculum, but I'm still here and I feel like if I can do it then anyone can. If you come here and keep persevering I think you can manage the stress.

You don't really need any experience with robotics or hardware coming into the CS major. Of course, there are probably going to be a few ambitious students in your classes that have had experience with hardware/robotics before, but you'll be fine with learning it for the first time in the same environment. Most CS majors don't really dive deep into hardware though. It's almost entirely dependent on the threads (similar to concentrations) you choose. For instance, in the Devices thread you will be exposed to more hardware than someone who is in a People/Media thread combination.

I know plenty of people who have failed classes at Tech (myself included) due to the rigor of some of these classes. Does that make us failures? No. Plenty of those same people (myself included) went on to do  CS internships at some of the biggest companies in the world.

Is it challenging? Yes, but that's what makes it worth it. College is a place that encourages you to make mistakes and learn from them so you're ready for the real world. It gets very stressful at times because of the rigor, but it's important to find a support system to help you make it through these times and utilize your academic resources when you need them.",positive,0.8507,positive,0.14255555555555557,10/12/2019

comments,"I didn't get any interviews as a freshman and only one as a sophomore, but interviews are seriously much easier to get as a junior, and you'll get better at doing them over time. Doing well at interviews doesn't always have as strong a correlation between being good at CS as you would think - there's a healthy amount of luck involved as well, and whenever you see people who have gotten an offer remember that they only had to do well enough and get lucky once.

Of course, it helps to be good at algo, and you should definitely practice with mock interviews (the best way to prep in my opinion), but the last thing you want to do is get discouraged because the recruitment process has a lot of randomness in it, and confidence maximizes your chances of overcoming that randomness. I've gotten offers from all the big 4, with smaller companies flat out rejecting me at the resume screening stage, and the opposite happen to friends of mine. I ran the technical interview club for around a year, and the most important thing I learnt from speaking to people going through the process is just how imperfect recruitment is, so prep in the best way you can and keep on trying.

Edit: also put work into making your resume good. I started TAing for algo in junior year so that made a huge difference when I put it on there.

Proof of enrollment is usually only needed if you're still in the jurisdiction that's calling you, i.e. for GT students if a Ga State or County Court is calling you.

They can't order you to appear (or at least enforce it) if you're out of the jurisdiction for any reason anyway, and they're typically so awash in crummy excuses from other people who just don't want to do it that when a legit one appears they'll often just instantly cross you off the list.

It also tends to go easier if you act sooner rather than later.

Certificates are not really worth much in my experience; it might be a deciding factor if you're applying for specific relevant positions, but so would the coursework on the transcript itself really.  And then there's always this weird conversation with recruiters: ""Um. Certificate?  What's a certificate?""  And a lot of hiring applications don't even provide a means to enter minors much less certificates. 

A minor like the [Denning T&amp;M](https://www.scheller.gatech.edu/centers-initiatives/technology-management-program/index.html) is generally going to do a lot more for you with a similar amount of work.

comments,"My total cost was about $6k outside of the school/program costs (Thats all available online). I was there for the fall semester.

$1100 eurail pass

$450 flight round trip (i got great deal, can normally be easily upwards of $800)

I was generally spending about 200 euros or $240 a weekend. Some more, not many less than 180euros

Then once you add in groceries, baguette sandwiches, and generally fucking around in Metz at the bars, i probably put down another $1000 there

If youre out of state and you can get in state tuition at gtl i believe. A lot of students i was with said they spent about the same in europe as they would in atlanta due to this. BUT, they got to do so much more with that money at gtl. For those of us in-state, its a straight up extra cost.

It was a lot of money for me as I paid my whole way, but in my opinion totally worth it. Ill probably not have another chance to do something quite like that later in life",positive,0.7071,positive,0.05845959595959596,10/15/2019

comments,I would say this is a pretty accurate estimate.  I would like to add though that the housing at GTL is cheaper (about $1000 cheaper if I remember correctly?) than if you were staying on campus in ATL so that helps offset the costs.

comments,"1. Yes. This info should be on the website for you to verify. *assuming same as two years ago.

2. I didnt really buy souvenirs. So it was a product of travel food, hostels/airbnb, drinks, general attractions, and transportation around the city additional to the eurail. And it varies a lot depending on the city/country. For example, interlaken switzerland. Great time, but both the food, hostels, and attractions are expensive. Compared to Prague or budapest are also a great time (very different type of place) but eastern europe is generally cheaper.

3. I dont recall food being too much more expensive at the grocery store there than in atl. So that is just gonna depend on your shopping habits tbh. And that figure was just for the weekdays when i wasn‚Äôt traveling

I forgot to mention cell phones also. I had tmobile and they have international coverage. Very slow but it worked. A lot of others got a french carrier. Someone else may be able to answer this more accurately, but i wanna say the put down about 20-30 euros a month for that as well.",positive,0.9538,positive,0.13261437908496732,10/15/2019

comments,"Judging by the timestamps of the emails, you sent this right before school started. 

As a student who assists in the advising department, advisors are absolutely swamped at the beginning of the semester. They have students emailing and walking in about their schedules, panicking that they won't graduate on time and that Phase II is about to start and they don't have the courses they need. During this time, advisors work overtime trying to get students the courses they need WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. 

Expecting to be coddled about APPH 1050 by an advisor that doesn't even belong to that department during peak stress for advisors was your mistake. I'm not saying their reply was the best, but you made the error by even expecting anything to begin with.

Have some responsibility and at the very least look up the correct advisor. This is pretty simple stuff that you should be able to do at this age. In the same way that you go to the appropriate professor to talk about grades, you need to go to the appropriate department advisor to get help.

I also agreed that the first advisor to respond was not helpful at all, but I tried to justify their actions by offering insight to what it's like to be bombarded with students needing advising, and yet still having to answer to questions like these that could have easily been fixed by some googling. 

Again, I work with the advising department. It's a lot more work than people think it is. When advisors get asked ""dumb"" questions, they tend to not be very friendly in their reply due to the fact that they are simultaneously tending to hundreds of other requests that, comparatively speaking, are a lot more relevant to what the advisors can actually do. 

He got the help he needed, just not what he wanted. The help he needs is being made aware that questions outside of his advisor's realm need to be asked to the appropriate advisor. The reply was curt and a bit rude, and I agree. But either way, the help is the same.

I think we both agree that the first advisor was rude, but to go as far as to say they were entirely unhelpful is, in my opinion wrong. Teach a man to fish...",positive,0.9313,positive,0.1342013888888889,10/15/2019

comments,"Hi. You are absolutely not alone. I dropped out of college and just went back to finish my AA last summer. I am 24 and just transferred to Tech this fall and feel so dumb compared to the intelligent/highly motivated and accomplished freshmen and sophomores I am in classes with. Im really not sure how I got accepted here but I am so lucky to be here and that‚Äôs what matters. I‚Äôm literally only taking 10 credit hours because I came from a very small college and didn‚Äôt want to overwhelm myself but it blows my mind how people are taking 18+ credit hours when I‚Äôm struggling to get by in my 10. This is the least amount of credits I‚Äôve ever taken but it‚Äôs also the hardest semester I‚Äôve ever had. My advice is to take advantage of the tutoring centers and have them do old exams with you problem by problem so you can be more prepared for the next exams. Practice really does make perfect. It‚Äôs great to understand concepts in calculus but when it comes down to a times exam, your best bet is being able to problem solve in a short amount of time which only really comes from practicing problems over and over again! You ARE good enough and the first calc exams is always the hardest!! You can pull your test grade up and likely even replace the grade with your final exam grade! You‚Äôve got this, you are worthy of being here, and you will make it through. :) 

As far as counseling &amp; mental health services, go back to care and explain to them that it‚Äôs an emergency. They have no right to turn you away and I‚Äôm so sorry that happened.  Make it known that you need the help because your mental health is important! I personally use GA behavioral health so if you do end up going to see someone off-campus, I highly recommend them. Clubs and organizations can also be a great help in feeling accepted and lifting some of the depression and anxiety symptoms so if you haven‚Äôt already, maybe consider taking the time to join a group. :) sending you all the love.

If you mainly want skills you will directly use on the job then business would be better, also the faculty in scheller are awesome in helping you get internships/jobs. 

IE is more quantitative, but you don‚Äôt get the specific business knowledge you would get with a business major. But, I think you get better problem solving abilities, and you get more required CS classes, more math classes. Also, apparently there‚Äôs a lot of statistics and probability. All of these subjects are the backbones of understanding the technical aspects of the financial sector. Also, you can pick up important business knowledge through clubs like the investment committee or consulting club.

I‚Äôm assuming you want a business related job, and if that‚Äôs true, IE and business will both get you most places, but a business degree probably won‚Äôt net you a engineering job. 

IE will be more intensive, but if you have a lot of credits or study abroad it‚Äôs very manageable. Business will give you plenty of free time trust me. 

Both majors are great and will place you well, but it comes down to your personal values and interests. Do you care about engineering or just business subjects? 

The kicker for me was that I wanted a more academic foundation of knowledge, for myself.

""It hurts my brain and my heart"" were his words.  This is not the kind of thing I listen to with a big, toothy grin. And then of course he tweets the next day ""There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week"".

Like other people have said, withdraw if you need to. There‚Äôs no shame in withdrawing from classes- I wish I had withdrawn from at least one or two that first fall semester. Also, use the academic resources here. Go to academic coaching, it‚Äôs free and they teach you one on one how to develop good study habits and have motivation to work hard. Use one on one tutoring; go to help desks &amp; plus sessions. But also take time for yourself. If you‚Äôre trying to force yourself to study 24/7 you won‚Äôt be successful; if you feel guilty every time you aren‚Äôt studying ditto. Don‚Äôt be ashamed of taking time to do something you enjoy outside of classes, otherwise you‚Äôll burn out really fast (as I learned). 

It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt make straight A‚Äôs or even straight B‚Äôs. Everyone here was a top student in high school; we can‚Äôt all be top students here too. Reaching out and getting help is completely okay and struggling in tech‚Äôs really difficult curriculum is only natural. It doesn‚Äôt make you dumb or even mediocre; tech is hard and everyone here is very smart.

If you don't know what you're talking about you should just not say anything instead of spreading misinformation. You're deluded if you think race isn't a huge factor.

comments,"The lecture is fine- I wish it was 3 days of class plus a day of recitation rather than 2 days of class and recitation so that you had more class time with the professor to practice problems together. Because of this, I highly advise going to recitation as much as possible. I imagine Shepler is going to be somewhat better than Garg because I have heard Shepler say she really loves some of the material in 2214. 

The lab is okay. It‚Äôs a 6 hour period, and most of the time the experiment itself takes about 5-5.5 hours. The lab reports are very easy considering it‚Äôs just an excel sheet, an abstract, and a couple of questions. The excel sheets are graded mostly on formula you input into excel, so make sure you don‚Äôt forget to do that (I have gotten a 60/90 on 2 lab reports because of this). Other than that, I really enjoy lab- it is long but I think it goes by fast. The lab ‚Äúprofessor‚Äù for next semester isn‚Äôt the same as this professor (Peak cs.

Don't be afraid of withdrawing from a class, multiple times in a row if need be.  I took AP calc in HS and passed the exam, but I decided to repeat calc1 at GT.  I passed it, but then took calc2 twice, calc3 3 times, and it took me 4 tries to get through calc4.   Calc5 was an easy A for me.   Physics was similar to calc in the number of times I took them.  Granted, this was over 2 decades ago and the courses have changed somewhat, but the culture of Tech remains much the same.

comments,"A couple notes:

\- T&amp;M is extremely competitive to get in and is also a 22 hour minor instead of the regular 15. It's a great program but I would look into other minors as alternatives just in case. For example, if you choose business you may consider Computational Data Analysis. Should you choose IE you may look into some sort of certificate through Scheller.

\- I'm pretty sure the T&amp;M minor you take is decided by your major. If you're in engineering or any business concentration except IT management, you take engineering &amp; business. If you're business with ITM concentration, you take computing &amp; business. You may want to confirm this with somebody tho.

\- I'm in the process of switching from BA to IE. The decision mostly came down to me narrowing down what I want for my career &amp; future and a more technical background is much better for what I want to do.

comments,"I may as well have written this post myself. I'm currently in my fourth year here, and majoring in computer science, but I was in your exact situation. Top ten in my small graduating class, middle of the road here at Gatech. Never had to study, so I never learned how. I still struggle with it, but I have also learned a lot. 

Because I don't like to study, I almost never miss class. The more you pay attention in class and learn the material there, the less you have to study. You said you were exhausted and missing class, and I can't pretend to know how you should fix that, but never underestimate the power of eating right and getting enough sleep. Also, start studying early. My freshman year I hated studying so much that it was not uncommon for me to start studying for something at 3 in the morning the night before a test. Then, shockingly, I would not do well. I still struggle, but I make the effort to start small. Maybe go over your notes for half an hour a few days before a test, and work from there as you figure out what you don't know or need to focus on. That way it isn't so overwhelming.

Don't be afraid to reach out to professors and TAs as well. I avoided going to office hours for so long because I was embarrassed and didn't want to admit how much I didn't know. But that's what they're there for. I have never had a bad experience in office hours. Study groups and group chats are also lifesavers, if you can find those.

I think the fact that you're doing just fine in most of your classes is fantastic. Math here is so hard, so don't ever think you're alone in that struggle. Curves are your friend! I promise it does get better, especially when you start taking classes that you actively enjoy and make you excited.

2020 is usually the first engineering course ECE's take, so it starts off at a very fundamental level and with the exception of a few topics (boolean algebra, state machines), it does not get too difficult. There are a few professors to avoid though, but their names are not coming to me off the top of my head. I had Raychowdhury and he's one of the best lecturers around. Unfortunately, he's a research professor so the class was very administratively disorganized (cancels a lot of classes, returns exams weeks later), but I still learned so much and highly recommend him. 2026 is definitely a bit of a time sink with the homework and labs, but as long as you're on top of your work, it won't be too painful. The content can get a bit tricky at times especially if you're not a math person, but with some studying it's honestly not too bad compared with other ECE classes. Also remember your recitation professor will be your greatest resource for 2026, I had Krudysz for recitation and he was awesome, and I also heard amazing things about Benjamin Yang!

I personally loved 2020 and 2026 and they stand as two of my favorite classes at Tech. Enjoy your spring semester! :)",positive,0.9964,positive,0.1785483870967742,10/17/2019

Focusing solely on academia is too stressful and thinking all day can really bog you down and possibly bring your grade down (that‚Äôs not scientific btw it‚Äôs just an idea). Try maybe doing some exercise every other day and maybe drawing or meditating.

comments,"I don't want to be *that guy*, but there are some inaccuracies in the part of the survey about credit.

First and most glaring, the statement ""If your credit card is stolen and someone uses it before you report it missing, you are responsible for $50, no matter how much they charge in it"" is marked as true.

This is false or at least misleading. While federal law requires a $50 fraud liability cap, almost every major issuer has a $0 fraud liability policy nowadays. A sweeping generality like this is rather misleading when it is likely untrue for most major credit cards. A card that doesn't offer $0 fraud liability probably isn't one worth having, in my opinion.

Second, the statement ""If you have any negative information on your credit report, a credit repair agency can help you remove that data"" is marked as false. While it is true that credit repair companies cannot help remove *legitimate* negative information from your credit report, the most common use of these companies is to help you get *erroneous* negative information removed, something which is a much more common problem than one may think.

A survey meant to encourage financial literacy shouldn't be plagued by such inaccuracies. There are one or two more misleading/incomplete things, but they're more nuanced than most consumers likely need.",negative,-0.8682,positive,0.06796874999999998,10/17/2019

To me the tests felt like he just flipped the question structure and shuffled the molecules. So instead of asking X (question) about Y (molecule) and expecting Z (answer), it would ask Z about A (molecule on homework) and expect X.

I've heard he's pretty eh, but his tests are easy, but I've also heard that your success in that class is also heavily dependent on your TAs.

comments,"Breathe!

First: if you don't get your project in, the worst case is that you get a zero on the assignment. I don't know if that means you'd fail the class, or get a grade you don't want, but keep some perspective! Yes, it sucks when you work really hard and end up not hitting your goal, but tomorrow's always a new day, and if you put 500 tomorrows together, you know what you get? *A day where that assignment you didn't hand in has absolutely no bearing on your life whatsoever.* Seriously, it's hard to remember in the day-to-day, but think about all of the stuff you stressed about a year, two, five ago and how much of a difference that stressing about it actually made for you in the long run. Probably not much, right? So...

Second: Stressing about something only makes you live through it twice. Stress/anxiety can be productive and helpful at times, but mostly it just serves to make you live through a bad thing twice: first, stressing about everything you have to do, and then stressing about actually doing it. So, take a breath, let some of that anxiety go, and know that you're doing the best you can. The anxiety and stress won't make your assignment better, it will be what it will be. And honestly, it'll probably be great!

Third: Any chance you could ask your instructor for an extension? Sometimes they have a heart and will give you a couple extra days to get the work in.

EDIT FOR DETAILS:

I am looking for a someone to partner with me on my venture to start BACTap. BACTap would become an app that provides the user with their BAC based of a few simple tests. This allows them to empirically know the effect of alcohol on their body, no subjectivity! Other features I have considered would come together to provide an app that drinkers can use for their one-stop resource when going out. My target customer segment is young adults who drink and I have already conducted experiments and performed over 123 interview to validate product market fit. I am confident that if the product can be competed, BACTap shows high promise. 

The partner I seek needs to be proficient in coding as they will be working the software development side of BACTap. Specific expertise/qualities I am looking for should consist of strong coding abilities, experience with machine learning, a willingness to commit to BACTap, strong soft/people skills (important for understanding our customers). Further, I will be taking this idea to Create X idea 2 prototype class in spring 2020 semester and ideally to create X Launch this summer (Those who select the teams for each of these programs have expressed interest in this start up).",positive,0.9808,positive,0.22333333333333333,10/18/2019

comments,"I'd recommend doing some serious thought about this the earlier the better (putting it off won't help), and explore all your options. I find that introductory classes aren't the best representation of what a career in a certain major looks like, so don't let your current struggles dissuade you too much. I've switched my major a couple times, but I still don't know if I really like my current major, but I wanted to graduate in four years and so I am. Still, I might have been happier studying something else all together. I think I was too preoccupied with graduating in four years and the preconceptions I had about other majors. But if there's something you want to pursue, don't let those things stand in the way. Think about what you want your day-to-day to look like: do you want to travel a lot, sit at the same desk everyday, interface with people, etc. Another suggestion is to look up a company that you might vaguely want to work for, look at their open positions that interest you (and their job descriptions), and see what they are looking for in a candidate.

comments,"This one is quite the double edged sword;
It is very difficult to have Tech held in high regard while allowing the experience to not be very hard. So let‚Äôs not just say to make everything easier, rather we should discuss how we can make things *better*. Some points that come to mind:

-Difficulty=/= Quality. Although, there is a relationship there. How do we give the best possible education to our students in a way that both the institute and students can afford (in terms of both time and money)? I am a proponent of adding more practical experiences to classes; these tend to be easier than the theory and help highlight the advantages that you can get from theory. For the individual, I‚Äôd recommend pursuing research, relevant extracurriculars, and internships. However, not everyone is going to do these, whether from course load or simply not wanting to, so how do we cause change that will help everyone?

-You don‚Äôt call all of the shots, but organizations will listen to students. Sure, it‚Äôs not always perfect, but the faculty is trying to make Tech better. Help them. There are all of the surveys you fill, and you can take an active role in communicating to those who can make things happen at an institutional level (don‚Äôt forget that you make a difference at the local level though). This can take shape in many forms, so it doesn‚Äôt have to be through the regular ‚Äúactivist‚Äù methods you see, but you can do those too.

-Culture. Tech seems to have an overall pessimistic culture, and as a pessimist myself I kind of enjoy that. However, connection is important to people, and it can be very, very easy for people to become disconnected or distant at Tech. Remember to be helpful and friendly to your fellow students, because ~~we~~ you all struggle in some ways, some more than others. It can be hard or weird, especially when being social is a weak point for a decent chunk of the student populace, but talk to each other! Make jokes. Have fun. You don‚Äôt need to throw a party, little things can go a long way, especially when things are tough. And don‚Äôt ostracize those who are clearly going through rough times, be supportive of them, even if only in words and what advice you can give. How can you help yourself *and* the people around you?

-Grow up. On the other side of the coin from being supportive, don‚Äôt baby anyone, you‚Äôre adults now and tech is a hard school. You need to step up if you‚Äôre going to succeed. If you or someone you know is having a really hard time at Tech, be sure that you/them take care of yourselves and take a little time to relax, but realize you will have to sacrifice time and effort to get something out of this. Make realistic plans to get to the point where you are at least content with how successful you will be a few years down the line. It can be very hard, much like tech, but it will be worth it if you put the thought and effort into it. Also don‚Äôt be set on one plan, being open minded to different methods for succeeding here can be a very helpful thing. If something isn‚Äôt working for you, you can consider alternatives. The question then becomes this. What do you want from college and are you pursuing it?

-Appreciation. Tech will kick most of its student in the teeth, it kinda sucks. But there are reasons we go here. The location is pretty nice, the scenery beautiful, and there are many, many opportunities. We are a good school that will give you valuable experiences and a leg up in the job hunt, even if it doesn‚Äôt always feel like it. Many of the people at Tech are quite good at what they do, and willing to share it with you (talk to your (good) professors but also other students). We‚Äôre a research institute, there are opportunities to do interesting and meaningful work while you‚Äôre still a student. There is a very impressive number of clubs and organizations for you to spend time with and learn from. 

As a last note, this is not permanent. The end of school is coming for you, even if it‚Äôs 15 years away (for most of you it‚Äôs not). Those classes are hard, but one way or another, you won‚Äôt be stuck doing them forever. These hardships will float away with the passage of time, all while new ones pop up. I will say as a graduate that things seem to get a lot easier after you‚Äôve finished Tech. You‚Äôll be done someday, so might as well make the most of the time that you have here. If it‚Äôs too hard for you, talk to some people, a lot of people, however is best for you, but talk about the issues you‚Äôre having. You most likely have it in you to finish, but you don‚Äôt necessarily have to. A lot of people leave Tech early and are fine, it‚Äôs not the end of the world. But if you do, definitely have a plan for what you‚Äôll do next. May you have good health and a good education, and if you do, share it with others.",positive,0.9995,positive,0.1974432511932512,10/18/2019

comments,"Hello! 2nd year BME major with prehealth pathway. Here's my plan for next semester so far. Thoughts?

CHEM 2311 - with Pollet - must take

BMED 3100 - Machelle Pardue - course critique averages seem okay

BMED 4853 - This is actually BMED 3400 Intro to Biomechanics - with Frank Lester Hammond - seems to be very new and has never taught this class before

BMED 2310 - with James Keith Rains - I hear is a total jerk, plays favorites, gotta kiss ass to get grades, etc

Expecting 9ish hours of research a week, and maybe going to emory/choa once a week for shadowing/volunteering if I don't do something else hospital related

So unless I'm blind, I couldn't find any information on any of the bmed professors in rmp. I wonder if these professors will change during phase II. I hear Rains is an actual asshole, so I'm considering switching that class to something else. I want something that takes a decent amount of time bc my later semesters don't get any easier. But I'm also tempted to pick BMED 4813 with Jeremy Ackerman, which I believe is the healthreach class with volunteering at Grady hospital? Correct me if I'm wrong.

comments,"Overall, your current plan seems doable. Research might take a toll on you if you're also having to take 2310 but it seems like you're considering replacing 2310 with an equally time-consuming class so that won't change much.

Buzzport might currently say Rains for 2310 as a whole but usually Martin (Marty) Jacobson and John Lau are in charge of the 2310 sections so I wouldn't stress about it too much. 2310 is going to be very time consuming regardless of who's teaching it.

BMED 4813 is actually called the CODE class (it's different from HealthReach which is BMED 4863). You do go to Grady and Emory but it's not volunteering. I'm currently in it and you have to do two 3-hour shifts/week at both locations. You are given free rein in the Emergency Department to walk around and observe things and ask questions.  Those 6 hours of shifts don't account for travel time though and there are presentations and papers that you have to work on as a group outside of class. Overall, it's a pretty time-intensive course.

BMED 2310 vs BMED 4813: I think 2310 is still more time-intensive than 4813 just because of the fact that you're learning a lot of new concepts (drawing, SolidWorks, etc) while also having to focus on improving a device with your team. You'll spend a fair amount of time outside of class prototyping and talking to experts and subjects of interest. Additionally, you'll have to work on more papers and presentations (kind of like 2250 but worse). I know 2310 isn't a prereq for 4813 but if you're interested in the CODE class, I would try and wait until you've taken 2310 first. While they're not necessarily related, it helps to have the drawing skills and the design experience from 2310.

Edit: I also wanted to add that I noticed you're on the pre-health track. I'm not sure where your motivation to take 4813 is stemming from but if it's purely from a med school standpoint, I would re-evaluate taking it. Ackerman told us in class quite bluntly that the course is more geared toward people considering grad school or industry.",positive,0.9878,positive,0.1448499776085983,10/19/2019

comments,"I went last year (which was the first year as well) and I thought it was an awesome experience. I'll do my best to answer your questions here, but if you have more feel free to PM me.

* I liked the program a whole lot. I thought the class offerings were good (and they're even better this year), the location was awesome (in terms of the dorms &amp; the classroom) and I love Berlin. There were a few inconveniences that came with living in a foreign country, but nothing really major. Public transport in Berlin is awesome too, it made me so sad to come back to Atlanta and have to deal with MARTA.
* I took Startup Lab, Machine Learning, Stats (not offered this year, you're welcome), and CS 2340. All the classes were really reasonable in terms of the amount of work you put into them considering it's a summer study abroad. I didn't feel stressed at all.
* The startup culture in Berlin is awesome. If you take the Startup Lab course, Professor Owen will post about and take you to lots of events in the area. I still get emails from them. I'd highly recommend taking Startup Lab if you're interesting in learning about startups (even if you won't use it for Junior Design - I'm not) or even just curious.
* Oh boy. Berlin is so centrally located in Europe, especially with two international airports, that you can go pretty much anywhere. I highly recommend Prague - including transportation (recommend RegioJet - really cheap), lodging, and food, I spent probably $60-70 for a weekend and had an awesome time. Don't forget to explore Berlin as well - it's an awesome city with lots of stuff to do. I also loved Budapest and Vienna. Going to the Alps is also a must, though it can be expensive depending on what you do. I stayed in Munich for the weekend and took a train to Neuschwanstein Castle for the day - very good decision. Note that places like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Switzerland are also great times, but they're expensive, so plan for it. There's lots of opportunity to make your own adventure though - some guys drove around Norway for a weekend and slept in tents on the side of the road, and a group went hiking in Painter's Way a few hours south of Berlin in Germany (I wish I had gone, honestly). You'll have more places you want to go than weekends to go, unfortunately, so plan early!
* Meet people before going so you can plan travel. Remember that you do have classes so like, don't forget to do your work. Make sure to sleep, traveling takes a lot out of you, especially every weekend, but it's super rewarding. Eat a currywurst and a d√∂ner and a d√ºr√ºm. Say hi to the guy who runs the Chicken Gem√ºse Kebap place right outside the U-Bahn station, he's cool and his food is good (and way less of a wait than Mustafa's, which is apparently one of the best in Berlin). Eat lots of ice cream (I regret not trying asparagus when it was in season because when else will you have the opportunity?). Have fun.",positive,0.9993,positive,0.3075403551251009,10/19/2019

comments,"I went this summer!!

* Enjoyed the program overall, there were some drawbacks in it being the first year because there was a lot that probably still needed to figure out and we didn't have a lot of guidance. The classes were interesting, if not as hardcore as they would be on campus. I enjoyed that Berlin was a lively city and that there was plenty of things to do, if one took the opportunity to go out. It is pretty well located in the middle of Europe, which allows for affordable travel to other locations for breaks.
* I took CS2340 (Obj&amp;Design), CS4641 (ML), Startup Lab, and Ethics. For each of these classes, save for ethics, we didn't really have much of the experience I thought we would have with those classes. Not to say anything about the teachers of course, they were great! If you're looking to learn these classes to the full extent as you would on campus, you will probably be a bit disappointed. However, I did learn at least a little from each class and would not have chosen other classes. I'd imagine that in future runs of this program, they'll have a more solidified program and more will be taught in classes.
* The startup culture is quite nice! I took startup lab with Professor Owen, who really cared about making sure we had the chance to get engaged with the local startup scene. We'd take off class a couple times to go on trips to events such as ""Silicon Allee"" and pitching events (ie, where founders practice their pitches to an audience). We learned useful information from these meetups, plus it allowed us to have a proper chance to meet Germans in the area! Basically, the startup scene is supportive to those just starting off and exciting for those who wish to get involved!
* Many of us went to Prague, as it was one of the closest cities to travel to for us. It was pretty nice, although not as exciting as I had hoped. Paris and Barcelona were true standouts, and Amsterdam was quite nice too. There are so many places to travel and I definitely think most of them would be quite nice to see, but those three were definitely a great use of my breaks!
* Make sure to remember that you're there to take classes, and as this program isn't as lenient with breaks as other program, keep on track with assignments. It's not as rigorous as on campus, however, so that should be a relief. Also, should you choose to go, make sure to interact with the city. There is a TON of stuff to find in the city, and there are a lot of museums and events to explore. We stayed in Kreuzberg, and the neighboring area of Bergmannkiez had a lot of restaurants that were generally affordable so that is nice as well. Having a European student ID for discounts is definitely helpful, as well as the quick, safe, and well-spread transportation system.

comments,"If you're trying to do CS, engineering, anything STEM, GT hands down. 

The biggest tech companies like Google, Apple, SpaceX, Facebook, Amazon, etc. will never take a UGA student over an equivalent GT student. UGA isn't a target school when it comes to CS. Being a target school is a huge deal, without it you'll have to work much harder to get your resume noticed by recruiters. 

You can read stories all the time online about people who apply to hundreds of jobs online and never getting a single response. That's because their resume is just one of hundreds, if not thousands, for every single position they apply to. When you're at a target school, companies will have dedicated recruiting teams to recruit people just from that school. 

College is just 4 years of your life. Sure you can take it easy and ""have a social life"" at UGA (despite what you think, it's not like you won't have a social life at GT), but you're going to have to work much much harder after college if you want to work at the very best companies.

If you're just looking for something easy to pay the bills, you'll likely find it more easily with a degree from a better school like GT, but the benefit/stress ratio isn't as good and maybe UGA would be the better option in that case.

I'm of the opinion that you shouldn't throttle yourself and choose to go to a less rigorous school just because you're afraid of being stressed.

comments,"Alright, let's bring it back to the basics.

When we go to the library, we're supposed to be quiet, right? Not only is it a rule, but it's both common courtesy and logical that when people are doing quiet things such as studying, reading, etc... that that quiet atmosphere should be maintained.  Even when there is a place being utilized as a study room (even if it isn't ""intended for studying"") it is - again - common courtesy and logical that to be even somewhat considerate to others, a decent level of silence should be maintained. But when there is a large disturbance amidst the quiet sea of studying, it causes a hindrance to all the people that were already there studying before you decided to go over and put on a little recital.

Imagine this: some guy decides to listen to his music - ok, right? - but instead of using headphones, he uses a speaker. Not only is he disturbing the people around him, but he is also disturbing all the people in that room (or in this case, on that floor of West Village). Sure, some people might like his music and vibe super well, but others would be severely inconvenienced by this whether they typically like that kind of music or not, in addition to the others who don't appreciate that kind of music in the first place. So someone gets a little upset and asks him to turn it down. And to that person's surprise, the guy with the speaker agrees...but he lowers it by one volume bar. That is not gonna change how loud it sounds to other people on that floor if he was already playing at full blast in the first place. Translate that back to the piano: not everyone wants to listen to your piano. 4-5 PM at West Village on a Saturday is by no means empty, but in fact, the opposite. Not only that, most people there are there not to have fun, but to study. If you took a poll of everyone there at West Village at that time, I can guarantee that more than three-fourths of the people were studying and that at least that number of people did not appreciate you slamming on the piano for the good of the other fourth. You ask how I know? Because I saw their faces, and they had the same face I had.

Ok, let's also talk about this. How many other pianos are there on campus? West Village is not the only building with a piano in it. Not to mention, the Couch Building which is literally a minute walk from West Village, IS the music practice building. For literally $30 a year, you don't have to bother anyone by going to a practice room - BY YOURSELF -  and practice to your heart's content without disturbing another soul. Play it loud or soft, slam the keys or use a little finesse, it doesn't matter to another dang soul.

Let me also say this: you are not a bad piano player, but what you are is inconsiderate of others and a VERY LOUD piano player. After I went to the third floor because I could no longer concentrate on my studies, I could still hear your piano playing very, very clearly....from the third floor! Ok sure, you can play the piano even when there are other people, but the least you could do is not slam the keys so hard that you can hear the piano from the third floor, or at the very least, that it doesn't penetrate the ears louder than my headphones on full blast while trying to listen to my music.

Overall, let me conclude with this: just think about others. If three people come up to you asking you to play softer, then take a hint and at least don't play fortissimo throughout the entire piece. It doesn't matter if three other people came up to you to complement your playing, those three people are suffering just for the listening pleasure of three others. If you took into account the other people there, then for those three people's benefit, more than ten, twenty, maybe even thirty people are suffering just so that they can listen to some ""good music"".

If you read this far, than I appreciate it, but please just try to be a bit more considerate, yeah?",positive,0.9782,positive,0.08959638680033415,10/19/2019

But seriously, it is perfectly possible to have a social life at Tech. Plenty of people do.  

I think the main thing I would advise you to remember if you are used to being a big fish in a small pond is that Tech is a much bigger pond, and you have to accept that if you come here you will not always be among the top performers (or even the top 50%). Constantly comparing your grades, job offers, study habits, etc to everyone else is a recipe for a lot of stress.

In addition, one thing I hear from many EnvE people is some gripes about how the degree requirements are a bit less flexible than those for civil engineering. Namely, CEE 1770 (CAD/drafting class) is not a degree requirement, but it's VERY useful for getting internships, so you would likely end up using your free elective on that class. And all (or almost all) of the main environmental classes in the CEE department will also count towards the CivE degree, so you can take a ton of EnvE classes and still graduate with CivE.

comments,"While I can agree that it's better for the sake of all (including the piano) that people be gentle with the piano, I disagree with your idea that it's easy to find somewhere else to play. 

Of all the pianos on campus, there are only two that are regularly accessible to the students: One is in the student center, and the other is in West Village. Even if I paid $30 for piano access at couch, it is often that those rooms are being used as there's only 4 practice rooms that have to be shared by the entire school of music. Finding times when a room is actually free is very difficult. Furthermore, the pianos in couch are subpar at best. The piano in West village may not be perfect, but it is significantly more playable than the pianos in couch. 

Remember that the student center decided to put the piano in West village. If they wanted the area to be a study space they would have left it somewhere else.

Immediately remove any empty food containers and clean up dirty plates, spills on counters, table tops, floors, as all these will attract them. Any food not kept in refrigerator needs to be sealed in zip lock bags or canisters. Make sure you don't have any drippy faucets or leaks where even a tiny bit of standing water will attract them. If you have potted plants, they could be attracted to the water in the pots. Don't use Raid. Get a boric acid powder (look for roach powder at Home Depot or Amazon) and sprinkle it lightly in dry areas where they are likely to walk through it; don't put it down too heavily or they will see it and avoid it.

I've tried this before, not with PTS but with a local towing company. I took them to small claims court, they didn't respond to the notice, and I won. I even got an official piece of paper from the court saying I was entitled to the full amount I was suing the company for. When I got the judgment paper from the court clerk, this was the conversation I had with him:

""So how do I collect the judgment, do y'all just take it out of their taxes, or...?""

""Oh, no, you have to go to them and get them to give you the money, or find out where they bank and get it from there.""

I did some research into this and collection is always the hardest part of suing in small claims court. Some people get lucky and the company sends them money to be done with the case, but if they don't, you're pretty much SOL. If you go to their office, they can call the police to have you removed for harassment/trespassing. If you send them letters they can ignore them. If you call them repeatedly, they can sue you for harassment. No debt collection agency is going to want your $200 judgment, and no credit bureau is going to allow an individual to report an unpaid debt. You can have the county confiscate some of their property and auction it off, if you can verify that the property is owned by the exact entity you sued and not by the company's owner or even a variation of the company's name. And unless you have the vindictiveness and money to hire a PI to find out where a company banks, *and* you have the luck to have that bank be cooperative with a judgment letter, going to the company's bank isn't an option.

Basically, small claims court is absolutely useless against companies. It really only works if you're suing an individual and can get his employer to garnish his wages.",negative,-0.9416,neutral,0.023809523809523805,10/20/2019

comments," As one of the three people mentioned who asked you to play quieter yesterday, here is my opinion.

I personally enjoy piano covers of different songs, so normally I would really enjoy your playing. And there are parts of your set that I do enjoy. However, you play most of your set extremely loudly. I was trying to work on a group project yesterday and needed to wait until you finished your song before I could have a conversation with my partner. For reference, we were sitting near panera, on the opposite side of the bottom floor as the piano. And this isn't just a problem I have. When you started playing around 4 yesterday (and around 5 today as I am typing this) the tables near you were full. After 30-45 minutes, most of the tables near you had cleared out. If you/other people playing the piano would play just a tad quieter, I think these people would be more likely to stick around and enjoy your playing. I personally would.

I see the discussion here about whether West Village is intended to be a study space or not. Regardless of what you believe, this doesn't change the fact that a large number of people use it as one. It is very inconvenient to expect someone to walk 20 minutes to the CULC from West campus to study (during a rainstorm) just because they want to be able to have a conversation about an assignment with someone sitting next to them.

TLDR: If you play just a bit softer, more people will probably appreciate the background piano music.",positive,0.9833,positive,0.2015584415584416,10/20/2019

That being said, it was not as big a time sink back then as you are describing it now... most people slacked off and did the bare minimum, and frequently the machines failed, even in the final competition, and so no one worried about it as much. I wonder if things have gotten harder or your batch of students just cares more. 

We had an individual component to the course early on in the semester, prior to being assigned teams, and on the individual competition they had negative points for the machine failing to meet the goal. I got the third highest score in the class because I was only one of three people with a total greater than 0, everyone else was in the negative! So the class was a pain, but everyone sucked at it. 

In our final competition every machine got three turns, and ours kind of died on the third one so we got a zero that round. Many other teams had machines that failed to accomplish tasks, and that was considered ok. I ended up with a B on the course. Are you in a class full of overachievers? Or are you just setting the bar too high for yourself? If not, try not to sweat it so much and focus on your other classes too. If there are a few different tasks, maybe take a call to just not attempt one of them and accept that you will get a zero on that task.

Your only deliverables are the lab and a final project (which if capstone utilizes the material a lot he lets you use your capstone project as your final) . The labs are also not too bad. Biggest curve is learning C but he assumes you know nothing when teaching it . 

I have this and controls lecture (ME 4452) , and mechatronics is definitely the lighter load.",positive,0.9634,neutral,0.01000000000000002,10/21/2019

Add onto that the several personal issues in my life these past few months, I literally cannot focus at all in my other lectures and have little to no study time or time to do what I love this semester because of the time and stress 2031 creates and that's why I'm so frustrated since I absolutely love learning and also believe that's what college should be about.

You don't hear from them much on here but a good percentage of this school is able to balance school work and social life without much issue, and coming in with a lot of credits definitely sets you up for that.

That said, the things people are saying about how employers won't hire UGA students over GT students is pretty blatantly false. The name brand of the school may give you a small bump when they read your resume, but friends of mine at UGA haven't had any trouble making it to interviews at top CS companies (Google, Facebook, etc.) and plenty of people at these companies never even went to college or went to some generic state school you've never heard about. The value in going here has more to do with building a solid network, getting access to better career services, and getting a top notch education.

If a large number of people decided to use Stamps Field as a study space, are you really justified in getting mad at the people who want to use it to run track? The actual purpose of a venue is important beyond what people try to re-purpose it for. 

&gt;It is very inconvenient to expect someone to walk 20 minutes to the CULC from West campus to study (during a rainstorm)

There are actually an abundance of study spaces on campus, most within close walking distance. Once you're done with your freshman year, you'll prefer virtually any other spot to the CULC most days.

And I would hope that if the study group is blocking the track, that they, when asked nicely, would move out of the way.  For the West Village case, I would hope that, when asked nicely, the person playing the piano would lower the volume.   I would also hope that the people studying would be reasonable and ask nicely.

In response to your claim that the purpose of west village is NOT to also be a study space, here is the first sentence of the Mission Statement of West Village found on the official Student Center Website [HERE](https://studentcenter.gatech.edu/about-west-village)

"" The goal of West Village is to activate the West side of campus and enrich student life, providing a place for the campus community to not only get a meal, but to meet friends, network, and **study**. ""

It is also rather difficult to get into a building like Love or the MRDC on a weekend without Buzzcard Access.  I have been trying to get access since freshmen year, but ME facilities is not very motivated to give access to these places. 

I, along with others, have been using West Village to study for the last three years and it has been great; it's close to my apartment and close to food.  I originally thought, and still believe, that the piano is a good addition to the space.  But recently, people have taken to playing too loudly.  

There is no reason that people playing the piano shouldn't be able to coexist with people trying to study, and I think the key to this is volume level.  I personally would enjoy live music while studying, as long as it is kept to a reasonable noise level.",positive,0.9869,positive,0.1840909090909091,10/21/2019

Your department probably has a building with uncrowded study spaces as well. Likely not as far as the CULC from West Campus either (unless you're a business major lol)

""Tell me about a time when you had a challenge working on a team"" etc. I'd go as far as to say it's helped me get a few job offers. 

But really more than anything else the class teaches you that sometimes you have to really go above and beyond to achieve your goals. I was in a group of 4, but basically only 2.5, and I learned that sometimes your goals are different than others, and you need to do what *you* need to do to succeed. Finishing that competition was one of the greatest feelings I've had at Tech, seriously. You'll be done quicker than you think.",positive,0.881,positive,0.1185897435897436,10/21/2019

comments,"Hello everyone, it‚Äôs Jason at the Library. I wanted to address some of the concerns raised in these posts. 

First ‚Äî the stools on the second floor. This is largely due to the fact that we‚Äôre in the middle of construction, so everything is crammed into one building. When Price Gilbert opens, the second floor will convert into its intended use ‚Äî low-technology iterative design space. This is why the tables are wood ‚Äî they‚Äôre meant for cutting, pasting, making, etc. That‚Äôs also why there are exacto knives and markers and stuff in the vending machine. Eventually, this space will be entirely for making things with your hands in a noisy space, and studying will move over to the quiet floors in Price Gilbert. So it‚Äôs set up like a studio because it would only function as study space for 18 months. The rest of it‚Äôs life it will be active, creative space. 

Second ‚Äî the expense of the chairs. These chairs are very expensive, largely because we have to buy them to stand up to thousands, if not millions, of uses a year. Before construction started ‚Äî five years ago ‚Äî the Library saw around 1 million separate visits a year. When everything is reopened, we expect that number to have grown in tandem with the student population. That means we have to buy well-constructed furniture ‚Äî because the adage is true: You get what you pay for. Cheap furniture will fall apart in months, if not weeks, because of the intensity of use we see. 

Third ‚Äî the relative comfort of the furniture. This is a pretty interesting topic, especially for those studying space design. We knew when we were designing the library that we‚Äôd have to accommodate a full spectrum of body types, study types, space use, etc., that would need to have a pretty long life ‚Äî mostly because money for projects not tied to a specific school is difficult to advocate for in a university environment. So, we tried to offer a tremendous amount of variety in the types of seating we offered. If there‚Äôs a seat you don‚Äôt like, try another. If you know you‚Äôre going to be at the Library for a long time, don‚Äôt sit on 2 if you don‚Äôt like the stools ‚Äî maybe try a table on 1 or a spot on 6. Again, this is a problem that arises because we‚Äôre in the middle of construction ‚Äî but know that when Price Gilbert opens we‚Äôll double the seating space so it should get better. 

Fourth ‚Äî lastly, I want to address the lack of study carrels on 6 and 7. We have met with students and revised the design of Price Gilbert so that the fourth floor will have individual study carrels. So, if you don‚Äôt like the open spaces of 6 and 7, you‚Äôll have other options. 

If you have any questions or anything, please always feel free to DM me or tag me. You can also hit me up on any of our social channels. I‚Äôd love to meet and talk with anybody, anytime, about anything. We‚Äôre here to help and make your study experiences at Tech as fulfilling as possible.",positive,0.9859,positive,0.07375283446712018,10/22/2019

comments,"Slow down, bro.   I realize that being in high school means that you probably don't have the perspective to fully grasp this, but college is merely a stop, a stage before you go on to the rest of your life.

Nothing against CS folks, but basic and even intermediate programming  (which makes up a large part of CS) is something you can train your skills up in without attending any kind of elite institution.   I knew one or two folks at school who had contributed to large scale linux libraries or source code \*before\* they matriculated at Tech.

And yes, sitting in your room doing nothing but homework or playing games or watching Youtube is a fast track to depression.

Though playing games made up a sizable chunk of my time living on campus, they make up almost none of my most vivid or happiest memories at Tech.... and I was around for quite a few games.

Working hard with no outlet or hobby to make you happy will make you imbalanced and you'll burn out quickly at Tech.   Anyone who has been in college a year has seen it happen.  Kids arrive bright eyed and bushy tailed and then disappear in two semesters because they weren't centered enough to handle either the workload, or the freedom, or the temptation to spend all your time and energy ongirls/guys/parties/etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The following two reasons should be chief among those why you're interested in matriculating here (or anywhere).   1 -You want a good education and good training that will equip you to enter the job market.  2 - You want an education that will challenge you intellectually and compel you to expand your perspective, understanding and knowledge.

comments,"I'm a second year here and I was exactly in your shoes senior year. For the 'What if I don't get into GaTech?' question, I can answer that.  The truth is it will suck, especially if you really wanna come here. I wasn't admitted to my in-state school, which was my first choice and had to watch my entire high school friend group go while I was moving across the country to Georgia. Life seemed really meaningless even into freshman year, I don't know if you could call it depression though. Anyways I'm kinda digressing but to get out of that slump, it always personally helps me to have a goal to work towards. Whether your goal is getting an internship for next summer or working on a project, making progress towards a goal that you want to achieve really helps out a lot. And being able to achieve that goal will make you feel even better. In the end thought, you'll find something that will help you get over it, even if it takes some time.

But anyways, if you do get in here and decide to come, joining clubs is easy. And since your CS, you won't really have that much homework so you won't need to worry about sitting in your room all day grinding. Even if you have a lot of homework, you can always work on it with friends so your not alone. Trust me, if you wanna make friends and join clubs in any college, you'll be able to do it. Unless you end up going to a tiny college, there will always be people who will want to be your friend just because of how diverse most colleges are.

And for your last few sentences about not being able to understand anything, you'll be fine. If you have the stats to get here, you are objectively among the smartest people in the country. Just know that no matter where you go. I know this really isn't advice, or even that uplifting, but there you go. Anyways, good luck with your admissions!",positive,0.9948,positive,0.19942307692307695,10/22/2019
comments,"It sounds like a lot of what you've been thinking about recently is *purpose*. What that is and what that means is different for everybody (which can be part of what makes it so difficult to pinpoint), but it's definitely a great thing to try and find over the next few years. When you think of CS, what's the drive to pursue it? Maybe it has something to do with a combination of enjoying the science and craft of programming while also being able to make useful software for consumers. Maybe you interact with technology everyday and consider how much it affects your life and helps you accomplish certain tasks, and maybe you want to be a part of the team that designs technology to help others. And maybe it's nothing along those lines... but there's a reason, and slowly tapping into that reason might be a good place to start. As you head to college, start thinking about the sorts of things you enjoy (and they don't have to be academic). Join clubs, try new things, and find out what you like to do. As you get a good grasp of that, then start asking the ""why"" question, and see where that takes you ;)

For me personally, I do a lot of residence life stuff on campus and one day hope to go into medicine. I'm not particularly religious and I couldn't care why humans were ""placed on this Earth,"" for a lack of better words, but I know for a fact that we're here. And, for me, that's reason enough to wake up every day and try and make life a better place for people. Life can kind of suck, so, if I can make life suck just that much less for somebody else, I feel like I've done my job. For me, it's that simple, but it's what keeps me going and what drives the sorts of activities, clubs, and careers I turn to.

If you took AP classes, you will still graduate on time. It doesn't do you any good to preemptively envision yourself having a bad time here - see what it's actually like and then decide for yourself whether your current trajectory is good for your mental health.

From what I'm reading, it sounds like you're definitely qualified to go here. Whether that means you get into Tech or not depends on how the admissions people think you are as a person. They decide that based on a small sample of your writing, and it's at least a little bit random. If you do get in - great, we have one of the best computer science programs in the country. If you don't, you'll still succeed because you were qualified to be here anyway.

Or u could catch the Marta (a subway) to other places in GA. One con of being here is that everyone is so goddamn smart it‚Äôs terrifying. Imposter syndrome is real and I‚Äôm pretty sure just ab every tech student gets it at first.

3. Academics is a pretty heavy load here but it‚Äôs not impossible to handle. I have a friend who finishes all their hw the day it‚Äôs due tho and has hella free time. I on the other hand procrastinate hard and waste too much time. But even if you‚Äôre like me and busy bc you can‚Äôt manage your time, you still find tons of time to hang out with your friends. Gatech has a really collaborative atmosphere tbh if you‚Äôre ever struggling tons of people are always happy to help.

It‚Äôs a stressful place. You‚Äôre *gonna* get stressed here. Classes are tough, the workloads are heavy. But it‚Äôs still so much fun and imo totally worth it.

4.I mentioned it in #3 but like everyone is so happy to help each other here. Like if you‚Äôre struggling u can just mention the thing and people will immediately try to help.

Also, everyone has a little nerd in them but it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre constantly surrounded by nerds. Like you can find someone to talk to ab a khalid concert and then 10 minutes later you can find someone to battle you in Pokemon Go

5. What are you overall opinions on housing and the food on the campus?
Food and housing. Well they‚Äôre what you expect from a university. Not too amazing but certainly livable. Some of the dorms are tougher than others with bugs (it‚Äôs GA. It‚Äôs hot. There‚Äôs a change a roach or two will get into your room), weird AC/heating units, weird bathrooms, etc. And food is always average-ish. Like it‚Äôs not bad but it‚Äôs not good. But it‚Äôs all livable here, you find ways around it. Idk ab everyone else but I do n o t spend a lot of time in my dorm.

6.  There‚Äôs tons of great people on campus, and there always a ton of events going on as well. As stressful as this place is, I think we have one of the more fun campuses I‚Äôve heard about. I was speaking with some of my friends and they were telling me how uneventful their schools were compared to gatech.

There is a cost associated with how long it takes their people to assemble the records and copy them, or whatever has to happen. I'm sure it's in the low hundreds of dollars or less depending how much is requested.

comments,"Currently taking 3600. The workload is pretty light outside of projects, which you'll have due roughly every 2-3 or so weeks after the first one (which is due around the middle of September). Projects can be a little tricky to get started, but they hold a help session and publish a hints/guide document half a weekish before the due date (which is often pushed back if the lecture isn't keeping up). There are only two tests (a midterm and a final), and they count a lot which isn't great, but there's a healthy amount of bonus points in the projects (and much of it is pretty easy to get). Content is super fun imo.

If what you say is true, it's interesting that the denied party was able to successfully file a complaint alleging discrimination on the basis of religion when in all likelihood other Jewish students were allowed in (assuming the Jewish members of YDSA quoted in the petition were at the meeting).  I would say this sounds more like discrimination on the basis of political viewpoint, which isn't mentioned in Georgia Tech's anti-discrimination policy.

comments,"Former 2110 TA Brandon here. Currently writing this while in a 2110 lecture.

If you are comfortable with the following skip 2110.

1) Can you code a non trivial C program? Are you comfortable writing code in C? Later CS 2200 projects will involve coding in C. You get a framework for a simulator be it Virtual Memory / Page Tables, Multithreading, Networking and you will have to complete the simulator. So reading others C code / writing C would be critical.

Other nice things to have under your belt is knowledge of how to use valgrind and knowing how to use gdb to debug your code.

2) Do you know the following components in digital logic?

 * Basic Gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.)
 * Multiplexers
 * Decoders
 * Memory components (Flip Flops, Registers, RAM, ROM, etc).
 * State Machines

More importantly can you take a State Machine and build a circuit from it. The very first project in CS2200 you will have to build a microprocessor for an assembly language. meaning by the end of the project you will have a circuit that can execute instructions for an assembly language.

3) Do you have experience coding in at least one assembly language? 2110 uses LC-3 which is a simple assembly language with 16 instructions, the instruction set makes it easier to learn future instruction sets of other ISAs.

If you can confidently do all three then you should be able to hit the ground running in CS2200.

And if you decide to take 2110 then it is some work with weekly homeworks and quizzes, the difficult part is that all of the concepts build upon one another and if you miss something then you will get deeper and deeper into a hole there.",positive,0.8991,positive,0.11630434782608697,10/24/2019

I took 2110 and then 2200 and I don't think taking 2110 helped that much in 2200 other than giving me exposure to coding in C. From what I can remember, 2200 covers a lot more material than 2110 so I didn't feel 2110 prepared me that much. 

Depending on which professor you're taking 2110 with, it was a lot of work between the homeworks, projects, timed labs, and quizzes. I don't even remember what I learned, I just remember doing a lot of work for the class. 

If you're worried about 2200, reading the textbook really helped me understand the material. The prof wrote the textbook and teaches by the textbook. Go to the TA office hours to get help with projects early. Do the weekly HW sheets (1 page, front and back), they helped test if you understood the important concept for that section. Hardest part of the class were the tests honestly because they were so long but just do lots of the practice tests (the prof has like 7 semesters of old tests uploaded) and go to the recitation before the test for test review. They go over questions that'll likely end up on the test. Feel free to go to a different recitation section that yours because some TAs are better than others. 

2200 is just HW (way easier than 2110 HW), projects, and tests, I found it easier than 2110 because I wasn't so bombarded by work all the time.",positive,0.9743,positive,0.2016666666666667,10/24/2019

comments,"I don't think she understands the fact that not only is 50% of the students failing bad enough, but also that MSCS students must get a B and above to get credit. That means over 50% of students won't get credit for the course. This number may go all the way up to 80-90% based on the grade distribution on the assignments so far. 

The fact that she acknowledges that poor performance on the midterm was due to lack of time, which is out of the students' control, but is still unwilling to curve fairly is kind of strange as well. If there is no possibility of students doing well because of time constraints, AND there is no reasonable curve, then the students are literally set up to fail and not succeed.

comments,"Are you really good at time management? 
Yes: Go for it.
Kind of: Try it, and drop a class if you need to, probably synth lab since it's not a pre-req for much
No: That sounds like literal hell.

All of those classes, with the exception of VIP and OChem 2, were very assignment heavy when my friends or I took them. Keep in mind that Thermo 1 is generally a 2 credit class in technicality only. It requires a significant amount of out of class studying to succeed, and with only two hours of lecture to learn the material, going to at least one problem solving session or office hours a week was pretty much necessary for me. Lecture+Lab classes also tend to feel like a little more work than a lecture only course with the same amount of hours. Synth lab was particularly taxing, with 1-2 lengthy lab reports due every week, but I took that in a condensed program over four or five weeks so my experience doesn't apply. Spread out over the whole semester it might be super easy, I don't know. But your schedule of 15 credit hours might end up feeling a lot more like 17 credit hours.

If you manage to fit CS 1331 into your schedule DON'T DROP IT unless you want to risk not being able to do your minor. The requirements for getting a CS minor are particularly weird and strict; you must have a minimum amount of credit hours (~48??) remaining in your major; if you have fewer, you can't apply. I also think you might have to take 1331 first before you can even apply to the minor, and there are like special info sessions you have to go to or something.

ME 3322 and ME 2016 are hardest.  COE 3001, MATH 3670, and ME 2202 are also serious but manageable classes.  ISYE 3025 and ECE 3741 are one credit that you have to take at some point but you still have to devote time to studying for quizzes.  Gotta do it some time... but maybe not with 17 hours.

If I were you, I'd take 14 or 15 hours.  I recommend waiting on one or two of the 3-credit courses (or replace with a low-maintenance elective).  Consider that ME 2202 and ME 3322 are prereqs for a lot, and also look where you can get a better professor (you want a good one in Thermo for sure).

My immediate personal suggestion is to go for a language class that's graded a bit more leniently (in my experience Korean is super easy and fun, I've heard good things about the Persian professor as well). I'd also advise looking into electives within your major (can't really help you there since you don't have it flaired), or see if there's a minor you'd like to pursue and take classes in that area.

Beyond that, there's a creative writing class that's apparently really easy but it also fills up really quickly. Really any LMC or philosophy class is probably gonna be a good bet if you're interested in the topic. There's a number of ""intro to x major"" classes that are one credit hour.

Some departments post planned schedule of classes.
I am only familiar with CS and MATH.

https://www.cc.gatech.edu/three-year-course-outline

https://math.gatech.edu/projected-schedule-of-undergraduate-courses

For CS, they do not say what they plan on offering in the summer because it is never certain, (although you can bet certain classes will be offered by looking at the history, as they have been offered every summer for the last few years).

Math says what they plan on offering all semesters.

In general if you cannot find the projected schedule of the classes you are want for summer, I would just go to buzzport -&gt; Registration (Oscar) -&gt; Student Services &amp; Financial Aid -&gt; Registration -&gt; Lookup Classes

From there you can see what they offered in previous summer semesters. Unfortunately doing it this way is kinda ineffective because there is a lot of clicking around for each year and each department.

He's not the leadership we need.""

OTOH, even if we don't win another ACC game but manage to beat that-team-from-Athens, the reaction will be, ""The Collins era has arrived. Long live Coach Collins.""

* Lots of detailed pictures about the living space
* As much paragraphs of description about the place as possible (location, cost, amenities, etc.)

And  you should obviously also go check out the place (probably with a friend just to be on the safe side) to make sure the landlord isn't a wack job. Good luck!",positive,0.8514,positive,0.29318181818181815,10/27/2019
comments,"The best options for you are in Home Park. Rooms out here rent from $500-$1000/month depending on location and how nice they are. There are some landlords that own one or two properties, and a few that have many, many houses, some with separate units in them if you're looking for a single. I've been renting from Jeff and Michelle for the past three years, and they're known to be the best landlords out here. [Website.](http://www.homeparkliving.com/home) Not to be confused with homeparkhousing, stay away from that guy! I've heard nothing but horror stories about his properties and how he handles repairs and security deposits. If you're looking for housing for next year (leases start in August) all the landloards start showing houses and signing leases in January, and they fill up pretty quick. After Christmas the websites landlord's websites will be updates with pricing and pictures of each property. It seems a lot of them fill properties by word of mouth as younger students move out here, and some of them just put for rent signs in front of the houses with numbers to call. Definitely see the property before you sign anything, and if there's current tenants there don't be afraid to ask how they like the place. That's what we did, and had a good experience.

If you're just looking for something semester by semester then all the students out here sublease through ads on Facebook on [GT Thrift](https://www.facebook.com/groups/199456403537988/) or [this group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GeorgiaTechSubleasesRoommates/)",positive,0.9833,positive,0.21455026455026452,10/27/2019

It has little to with CCP, but more with their insecurity. They feel like their special status (legacy of the British colonial era) is being threatened. HK's economy is not doing the best, there's way too much divide between the rich and the poor, and the young are worried about their future. The extradition bill, the HK police, the HK gov or the CCP are merely evil dragons to blame all this to. I don't support the protesters (especially the violent ones), and I despise the people using them to achieve the purpose of destabilizing HK and undermining China.

I don't totally support the CCP but I think it's a necessary evil. They've done an amazing job in developing the country and improving the life quality of the biggest population in the world. Frankly I think no other system would have done it better. And yes, many people actually support the CCP. If hypothetically China had a direct election and a few other democratic parties, I'm sure the CCP would still have won.

I had known this person for a bit and just like many people they had some rough patches earlier in life, and they had talked to me about them. So I asked them what it was. They explained that they might lose their job because of a dumb management change at work, and they they loved that job, that they we were worried about being separated from their coworkers and friends and most importantly they didnt want to see their coworkers hurt like that and then they just broke down crying on my shoulder. They told me how afraid they were about the future. This was about 2 years ago. They never did lose their job. Now they are dating one of my best friends Every time I see them together I am just glad. I am happy that the sadness is gone for them. Nothing is close to perfect for them and it likely will never be. But they are happy and just knowing what they have been through, both of them it makes me hopeful. It just gives me such hope to see someone come back from a time like that. I told a friend recently the most amazing thing about this semester, what makes it better than any semester I have seen in the past even though its been the most up and down for me, is how much more open people have been about mental health. It makes me hopeful to a degree I cant express to see so many people I know be open about the fact that they are going to counseling and talk about their issues with friends. And even more so, to see how much all the people I knew came to the ones who were hurtings aid.

comments,"It seems somewhat harder than other majors. Ish.

1. Devote $100 to modelmaking materials every semester. Or maybe $200, depending on what the studio is like.
2. ID studios are relatively short, 8(?) hours of studio a week with 20hrs of homework. It's manageable, but do **not** take more than 1 ""hard"" class alongside studio.
3. How important are your hobbies? Can they be automated/set-to-season-aside? If you're ID, you will need to be very protective of your hobby time, *or* blend it into your studio work in some fashion.
4. Please be understanding when other people give wrong advice, or demand impossible requests. A lot of people mean well, but, they don't understand that studio culture involves spending 6+ hours a day with other classmates in the same classroom, and that grabbing lunch regularly may not be possible at times. This also means be **very** careful about relationships, as studio will normally become your largest time investment - save your Saturdays for the things you want to do the most!
5. Students are strong in the arts *and* sciences: color theory, aesthetic gestalt, arduino programming, CNC machining, welding, poetry, music. The point is not to get good skills, but to put skills to *good use*.
6. Standard design advice section: field is extremely competitive, portfolios matter more than grades, salaries are below those of engineers if you stay in the design field, half your freshman class will change majors to something else, mental health is abysmal and pessimism in studio is rampant. You can find a ""why are &lt;design majors&gt; poor/stressful/bad choices/worthless"" threads a-plenty, so stay positive!

Design is a major change of culture, that will likely disconnect you from the rest of the GT sphere. Be *very* mindful of every minute you spend, put as little time as possible into studio, and disconnect your self-worth from the emotionally-loaded craft you make in studio.

And yes, dedicate time to fun socialization *and* isolation, otherwise ID will swallow your time. It is a greedy major, with 30 hour weeks for a single class as par-for-the-course, vague objectives, and nonsensical parameters that change every two weeks. It's quite fun!

What made lecture the most useful for me was going in and not putting pressure on myself to deeply understand all of Fourier series or whatever in one day. Instead, I think lecture in that class is really just a chance to get a look at the concepts you will need to really know, so that you remember things better for the tests and homework is slightly less frustrating.

comments,"I've spent time at The Standard, UHouse, and SQ5 and also did a lot of research before moving to where I live now; hopefully some of this is helpful

SQ5: Although not as new as the Standard, it is kept up extremely well by management (new management company as of last year(?)). Rooms are fantastic and so are the views on the upper floors. In my time there I never saw a single bug aside for ones that flew in when we kept the balcony door open. Walls between rooms are a little thin, but only within the same apartment. Each apartment layout is separated by poured concrete iirc so that explains why I've never heard my neighbors.

Location is simply unbeatable for off-campus housing. Much smaller capacity than the Standard/UHouse, with much smaller common areas to match (gym, pool, lounge). From my experience, it's MUCH quieter than the Standard (and uhouse). Less parties in the common areas and stuff. Management staff is acceptable, which is more than you can say for most college housing buildings. It's stupid expensive, especially nowadays. Parking is abhorrently expensive too, and there is absolutely no room for negotiating rent or anything like that.

UHouse: Interior looks exactly like SQ5 if you told the contractors ""Save 20% when building this room"". A lot of the finishes are the same or similar. Same oven/stove/microwave but not finished in stainless steel. Front door to apartment is hallow instead of solid wood like SQ5. Bathroom is slightly smaller and finished a little cheaper. Stuff like that, but the vibe is the same.

Location is decent, a block north of 5th street. The rooms don't have views like SQ5 or some of the Standard. Still plenty of layouts to choose from and I haven't heard too many complaints about maintenance. Pretty huge pool deck and LOTS of common space (that pretty much turns into a free-for-all party on the weekend, it's unreal).

&amp;#x200B;

Standard: Very new with some construction ongoing. Unbeatable pool deck, seriously just gorgeous. Location is decent, a block south of 5th street. Rooms are nice with tons of layouts to choose from, and are nearly as nice as SQ5. Unfortunately I've heard nothing but complaints about management, both during construction and now... The fact that they screwed over so many students by not having rooms ready in time alludes to their level of care for students.

comments,"RA here, I don't disagree with you. Housing needs a lot of work, as do most departments on campus. **I challenge you to think of what can be done to affect meaningful change**, given what I believe to be the central problem (as described below) of Tech.

What Housing will say is that if you don't like where you're living or you don't like your job, quit. There are plenty of other people who apply every year for the job who can and will take your place. Why will there always be a pool of people willing to do so? The job provides free Housing, among other select benefits, and students will never not need to reduce expenses when and where they can. People always complain about Housing and other departments on campus, but the reason nothing will ever change is this... If you leave, Tech‚Äîfrom a business standpoint‚Äîdoesn't care. There are over 30,000 people that apply to be here year after year. If you're not willing to pay to be here, somebody else will be, and they'll take your place gladly. Why improve facilities and the student experience if keeping costs low brings in more students than we can even accommodate?

I know that's a pessimistic outlook on things here, but it's the unfortunate reality that I've come to accept. Working for Housing is not a job I can recommend to most people or one that I find truly rewarding anymore. At the end of the day, you have to do it because your heart is in it, and the price of doing so will be poor living conditions and (what I believe to be) unfair terms of employment. If your heart is no longer in it, it's not unreasonable to start looking at other jobs on campus.

comments,"Cons:
Management at the standard will take forever to fix things/clean up if at all, especially for common spaces. They advertise that their deluxe rooms have pool tables. They don‚Äôt. Even the common ones have broken equipment. They don‚Äôt enforce the rules for the pool deck so there‚Äôs way too many people and over half snuck in, and there‚Äôs always a ton of trash. There‚Äôs 2 elevators for the main tower which is 18 floors and they‚Äôre slow as hell so it‚Äôs a nightmare if you‚Äôre ever in a rush. They have an issue with the fire alarms so they go off all the time to the point where no one evacuates anymore. I heard there was also some issues with people getting back their security deposits. 

Pros: The rooms are gorgeous and since they‚Äôre pretty new it‚Äôs in good condition. It‚Äôs just the maintenance part that‚Äôs an issue. A lot of people still don‚Äôt park so there‚Äôs a lot of available space in the garage. There‚Äôs the Starbucks and new pizza/sandwich joint downstairs and now the Tech Square express stops right by the building, across the street at the edge of the GT hotel property so it‚Äôs convenient. There‚Äôs some pretty decent study spaces and I‚Äôve never had a problem finding a private area to do work. No bug issues bc again it‚Äôs pretty new.

comments,"If you're not getting sleep now, you're not gonna get sleep with a different major. Make sure you're switching for the right reasons. Don't treat the symptom, treat the problem.

If you like your major and just want to live a healthier life in general, then you need to learn time management, and you need to start today. First and foremost, sleep. You need sleep to function, you're shooting yourself in the foot if you don't, that's basic biology. For many reasons, getting an extra 4 hours of studying is negated by the fact that you're now 4 hours short of the correct amount of sleep. Start going to bed at a reasonable time relative to your schedule, try to get 8 hours or preferably more. Oh, and I mean start tonight. Your mind and body will thank you.

Second, stop procrastinating and work at a time when you're most alert. For me that's in the morning and afternoon, I try and knock out at least a portion of my homework every day, chipping away at it slowly so that even if shit does stack up, I'm not forced to pull all-nighters to finish it. Also, make sure you prioritize tasks. You don't need a perfect A in everything, and the easier classes can usually wait a bit longer if necessary.

Third, do things properly the first time. Don't half-ass or rush shit and make sure you understand thoroughly what is happening. That way you don't have to cram for exams, because you've already learned through extensive note taking and doing homework right.

Finally, set aside time for yourself. This if for your own sanity and mental health. Set aside time during the day or evening when you can kick back and do whatever without thinking about school. Go to the gym, watch TV, play video games, whatever, just keep an eye on the clock and go to bed or work when you need to.

comments,"I would like to tell you some things about mold and how to kill it that helped me considerably. First, mold needs three things to grow: moisture, cellulose, and darkness. Washing machines are major incubators of mold, especially public ones and front-loaders. So everything you wash is getting mold spores on it and you are bringing that into your space and making everything worse. Neither hot water, nor soap, nor putting it in the dryer will kill the mold and neither will bleach. Bleach only bleaches out the mold stain but doesn't kill the spores. You have to use a laundry mold killer in the washing machine in the fabric softener cycle or in the last rinse that will kill the spores. EC3 is what was recommended to me by my doctor. It is a natural enzyme that kills mold without harsh smelly chemicals that wipes out all the spores. I would now never do a laundry load without it. EC3 also comes in a concentrate that you mix with water and put in a spray bottle and apply directly on anything that has mold on it, like walls and ceilings or whatever; very effective. They also make room foggers that you can set and bomb the hell out of the mold everywhere in your space, candles that also kill spores, and other products.  If you can't eliminate the conditions that cause mold to keep growing back then you have to be on constant maintenance killing the spores or the problem will keep coming back or getting worse. Mold causes serious health issues even if you don't think you feel sick. You can be fatigued or mentally 'foggy' and not even realize it. The symptoms can sneak up on you over time.  If you already feel sick you need immediate remediation.  GT housing has some sick buildings.

You're saying that the scent doesn't matter, which is my point. It's not something relevant in the argument at all because it itself doesn't bring any drawbacks.

Take his class and you can expect less than 30 minutes per week extra work. If you take Losego you'll probably have a lot of work to do.

I can't speak for ME 1770 but I personally think CS 1371 is pretty easy. The homework takes at most 3 hours to complete and the tests are straightforward. They even offer 2 grade modes for this semester, which allows you to screw up one test and use the final to replace it. It's definitely not as bad as what your academic advisors say.

comments,"1. The central gov is not ""slowly eroding their basic civic liberties"". There's some high-level intervention from CCP of course since HK is still a part of China (not a neighboring country). But that's about it. CCP has kept its promise well since '97, and that's precisely why there are so many dissidents over in HK. Think about it. If CCP was really ruthless and tyrannical as they say, would they even be allowed to exist? After all, it's just a city of China and it would be super easy to just go in and crack down on anyone who has a different opinion.

Let's just look at what rights they have. They have all the rights people in western democracies have. Election? check. Organize demonstrations? check. Free media? check. Free internet? check. Can a Hongkongnese openly attack the communist government? Yes (cases where people do get arrested for that are very few and unconfirmed, considering how many people have said bad things about CCP). It goes on and on. In some areas HK even surpasses western democracies, for example how tolerant the police have been. Imagine mobbing up and attacking police officers in the US.

They went to the street to oppose an extradition bill (which by the way, was very fair imo), and the Chief Executor apologizes for her ""negligence of public opinion"" and withdrew the bill. If this is not democracy, I don't know what is.

All they're crying about is an uncertain future, because the deal between China and Britain will end in 2047, when HK will probably lose its special status as a highly autonomous region. The irony is, if they behave and enjoy what rights they have, they may end up retaining that special status. 

2. What's so different between China and its neighboring countries? Oh boy. Japan, the most populated country of the list you mentioned, has less than 10% of China's population. Granted, Japan and Korea(south) have developed their countries well after ww2, but much of that had to do with them being US allies and getting financial aids (note: a large part of Korea's economic boom happened under an authoritarian military government).

Let's look at another democratic Asian country with similar population as China, and starting off from a similar level after WW2: India. No offense meant, but an average Indian definitely does not have a higher living standard than an average China. And democracy does not work too great for India. Rigged elections are commonplace. The divide between the rich and the poor is huge and growing. Many infrastructure projects have time or cost overruns.

And lol. I don't think Taiwan is in good shape anymore.

China's economy did only boom after opening the market in the 80s. But they didn't ""get out of the way"", it was still CCP who made that decision and it still has a grip on the market. At the end of the day, people benefited from the ""Party's policies"" and they are happy. It's only natural they trust the government more now.  Furthermore, the act of reform shows CCP is willing and capable of changing itself and correcting its own mistakes, which gives people hope.

If you know of the Pyramid of Needs, the base two levels are physical needs (food and drink) and safety. Which, sadly, most Chinese didn't have before CCP. That's what CCP promised them. And CCP has kept the promise, albeit after some unpleasantries. Beyond that, CCP has built a strong country for them to call home and be proud of. So there's pride and sense of belonging.

Most people are dumb and basic and they would happily trade a bit of ""freedom"" for food, drink, fancier cars, bigger houses, better education, a stable and safe society, a promising future and strong country to belong in.",positive,0.9979,positive,0.1765291005291005,10/29/2019

comments,"I gotta say.... I run a product development firm here in Atlanta and have seen and worked with many Tech grads from their ID program and...... so far I'm not impressed. My guess is that because Tech has a strong engineering program, the industrial design program sort of falls second place to that - and all the ID students seem to be pseudo engineering students instead of true art + design people. If you're looking for good ID in the south, check out Auburn's program. They provide a great blend of art and engineering and produce graduates who have a realistic, hands-on approach to product design and, in my experience, bring more value to the table as a designer.",positive,0.9222,positive,0.2590909090909091,10/30/2019

comments,"For EE, any of the three ""Intro to ECE"" (ECE 2020, 2026, 2040) classes would fit in that category. I believe most, if not all, other ECE courses require you to have taken at least one of the three in the past.

ECE 2020 covers digital design and is probably the easiest of the three for most, though I've heard some professors make it tough. The class starts off with basic boolean algebra and switches and eventually builds itself up to combinational circuits, sequential circuits, and eventually a simple model of a computer. It's more of a Computer Engineering class, but it is beneficial for anyone living in the modern, digital world to have some sort of sense as to how digital electronics work.

ECE 2026 covers basic DSP and is basically an introduction to signal theory. If you like math, this class is definitely for you. Many ECE's say this is one of the hardest classes they've taken, but that's mostly because the workload of the class is quite high (homework and MATLAB lab every week and the occasional online assignment). However, it is probably the most interesting course for non majors (unless you REALLY like circuits and/or digital design) as the material is so applicable to so many fields. It's definitely my favorite ECE class I've taken, but I do see how many people would not enjoy it.

ECE 2040 covers basic circuit theory and is basically the circuits unit from Physics 2 but more in depth (with a bit of differential equations added to it). This class is probably conceptually the most difficult of the three, and I would not recommend taking it before ECE 2026, as the material towards the end would be somewhat confusing if you don't have a grasp on phasors and frequency response from 2026. I definitely had the hardest time in 2040 partially because I took it before 2026, but also because it is definitely not as easy as the other two. However, if you want to go into something related with electronics/analog design, it is worth considering to take it (or the non major version of circuits, ECE 3710).

Except for ECE 2020 with certain professors, none of the three are easy in the sense that you can breeze through with an A, but they're definitely easy in the sense that they're not the hardest classes in ECE. Those seem to be clustered mostly in the 3000s level. Personally, I recommend taking ECE 2020 or ECE 2026 if you're a math person and/or you're willing to put some time and effort into the class.

My only complaint is that lectures do not help with assignments, and the assignments can be difficult for the wrong reasons. The number of assignments we get and how long each one takes makes this class take the most time consuming class I have ever taken. But it is thru all these assignments that I am actually learning something.

There are no tests/midterms/finals, and you can do a %10 extra credit lab for your final grade. Also each of other 4 labs you must do can give %1-3 extra credit to your final grade as well. If you don't drop the class, don't bomb to final project, and put a lot of work in to the labs, I think A or B should be reachable. Just a really time consuming reachable. Like I have dropped a class just to keep this class.

Even though it has flaws, I still really recommend the class. You just have to take easy classes with it to not get overwhelmed, and unfortunately that is not always possible depending on what classes you still need to do.",positive,0.9419,neutral,-0.013949275362318844,10/30/2019

comments,"I'm in CS4210 right now and took CS3210 a year ago.

3210 requires a lot of work. There's little guidance on the projects, and you'll have to look up a ton of things on the x86 architecture. You're essentially implementing some basic, low-level features of operating systems for each project. You have to do it within the already written source code of the minimal OS they provide called xv6. (At least that was what they were using when I took it.)

4210 is much more high level. Lecture is always on the content of a particular research paper. So far we've covered things like kernel types, virtualization, synchronization mechanisms, and inter-process communication. In the 2nd half of the class we're only focusing on distributed systems and different technologies for running applications on them. There are 4 projects (or 2 if you choose to do a special 2nd project), which are just userspace simulations of a few of the things we're learning about. They're annoying to do, and the TAs are quite bad at providing details. I've had to attend several office hours just to get them to answer a clarification I've asked on the piazza, but they failed to respond to.

If I'm being honest, I enjoyed 3210 more than I am 4210, even though it was definitely more work. I just don't care about the stuff I'm learning in this class. 3210 was fun because I got to get my hands dirty, building parts of the actual OS. In 4210 we just flap about concepts from research papers, never going deep into anything.

Oh, and another fun thing about CS3210 is that you have a final project instead of a test. You get to do anything you want (within reason, and it can't be too simple) with the xv6 OS. My team ported a lisp interpreter to it, and I wrote a basic text editor to write code for it. It was super fun.",positive,0.9691,neutral,0.038534013605442174,10/30/2019

This sub seems to just want to complain about how hard tech is, progressively, each year worse than the previous and it‚Äôs so annoying. As annoying as people saying ‚Äútech used to be harder‚Äù. But, you know what, that‚Äôs what makes your degree worth something.

You want it easy? Go to Full Sail, they‚Äôll give you a ‚Äúcomputer science‚Äù degree if you have a pulse and a pocket book. Go to literally any school that hands out the degrees.

Your degree has value BECAUSE it‚Äôs difficult. That‚Äôs how it should be. You don‚Äôt just get a degree because you showed up. That‚Äôs what gives the degree value that makes companies show up to the career fair. You want to see a depressing career fair?

There are valid complaints, a lack of health resources being one of them, but complaining about tech being hard isn‚Äôt one of them. What do you think happens in real life? You think stress just goes away? You don‚Äôt get promoted or keep a job just because you showed up and tried hard. You might do everything right, to the best of your abilities, and still get burned by someone who cruised by you. What happens when that person cruised by you because they could handle the stress of a multi million dollar project and you couldn‚Äôt?

If your mental health is a concern, get the help you need and tech should have those resources. Just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs gonna get you a promotion compared to the person who can get by without it when you meet reality ‚Äî you need to find a balance and your balance may not be at the level of those who compete with you. And it might mean you can‚Äôt get a degree from tech unless you can find a way to balance yourself to the level demanded by the degree.",positive,0.8234,neutral,0.008953373015873017,10/31/2019

It may well be that Tech is harder to fail at than it used to be (or harder in general etc) and it may even be that that‚Äôs worth talking about! However, maybe it‚Äôs not best thing to throw it constantly in the face of students who are really pushing themselves and are on the limit. Even if you feel what they need is a push or a reality check, it may not be the time or place to do that on a reddit post where they‚Äôre already not feeling very positive. 

I personally don‚Äôt feel like tech has been that hard for me, I have a 4.0 and I haven‚Äôt felt like I need to eat breathe and sleep classes to do it either. However my dad, who went to tech, loves to joke about how much harder it was for him (although he knows who‚Äôs smarter). The points he raises though are usually stories of professors just failing students for no good reason, or giving a horribly unrepresentative exam and just failing half the class when they don‚Äôt get it. These things have more or less gone away which may be good, or you may argue they‚Äôre important real life lessons. 

Either way, the message here is - when someone at tech reaches out on this reddit to express their difficulties and stress etc, don‚Äôt tell them how easy their life is.

comments,"Facial recognition on video taken at every street corner is disturbing. Car jackings and muggings on a college campus is disturbing. Getting society to deeply discuss the balance between privacy and security, that's disturbingly difficult.

On the one hand, technology like plate readers and facial recognition probably do allow GTPD to better monitor campus with a smaller force. It would be interesting to hear details of how they have used and are planning to use the plate readers, but I know they may not want to share that.

On the other hand, we all lose a little bit of privacy as a result. I think the main arguments are 'what if all that data is made public' (i.e., what if a police dataset is leaked online) and 'what if all that data is leveraged against people who have not comitted a crime?'. The FBI has done some pretty shady things at times - what would thier reaction to the civil rights movement be today? What would a 1960's FBI have done with license plate and facial tracking? 

I know it's a touchy topic, but I'd love to hear more about the safeguards on the plate reader data that @GTPD gathers. Is it kept local, or shared nationally? Is there an audit process to make sure the use is justified? Has seeing which vehicles drive through campus helped GTPD keep us safer, or just useful for finding expired license plates?

Kids are arriving at college under greater stress and feeling it more while there.  2nd, some colleges do better at telling their student body what is going on. Of the 3 colleges, Tech is the only one that sends out notes of grief and sadness over these events. Is that better or worse to talk about it openly? I honestly don't know...it might make it seem more common than it is and make others feel hopeless. I'm undecided on this.  Finally, colleges are all trying to decide what to do.

There are plenty of students who *don't* feel helpless and who *don't* think some professor is a dick.

From what I understand, GT has currently, and had when I was there, plenty of mental health resources.  Maybe they need more, I don't know, maybe there's a stigma, I don't know.

comments,"I know this isn't the point of this particular post, but this isn't just a new thing at Tech, it's a fairly new thing across higher ed.  If you look around you will find a ton of articles in journals that cater to a higher-ed audience like the Chronicle of Higher Education about dealing with mental health issues on campus.  There are also multiple distinct issues that relate to this.  For instance:

* a few decades ago colleges had much higher admit rates and much lower graduation rates.  There is a bunch of work, including at Tech, trying to predict academic success (or lack thereof) and direct help to students who need it.  Some of this can get pretty creepy and privacy invasive, like following online habits to detect increases in game playing, which might indicate withdrawl from classes.  Different schools are coming to different conclusions on what level of oversight and intervention is appropriate, but there isn't really a consensus
* there seems to be an increased need for mental health professionals on campus.  It's an open question at this point whether it's better for the college to provide these or to partner with a private organization who has mental health as their core mission
* because the costs of college have been rising, there is more pressure to not waste the money you have put in to it.  This could be reduced by reducing costs, but there are a ton of cost drivers and frequently things the students ask for and use to choose where to go drive up costs so it's not always obvious how to reduce costs without reducing service

Pretty much every university in America is dealing with all of these right now and there is no consensus on the right way to do any of them.  So you may well be right that sending out notices is the wrong thing to do and is only increasing problems.  I'm sure there are active studies on that right now, but for the moment nobody knows.

I didn't have any internships, per se, but, I worked at the Ferst Center here at Tech when I was a student. I unfortunately hadn't thought through a career path (that's a story for another day), but working at Ferst is how I kind of fell into the non-profit world.  I also served as an officer for a student org, and our staff advisor said to me one day, when we were discussing the club's activities, ""Have you ever thought about event planning? You seem to enjoy that aspect of things."" I had never even considered it, and I guess naively didn't even know Event Planner was a ""real job"" but that conversation opened my eyes... and that is the path I followed.

I worked at a small performing arts non profit for about a year, doing administrative stuff and helped on the weekends when the org rented space for kids' parties. That wasn't entirely my cup of tea (performing arts, that is) but my next stepping stone at a community organization was my sweet spot. I took on a similar role there, starting as administrative support, and thought it would be maybe for a year or two... and it turned into 10 years.  I had several different roles while I was there, each a bit different from the others, which gave me a really great perspective on how all the various pieces of an organization work together.

I started out supporting one small fundraising arm within the org, then moved on to a position supporting the Associate Exec Director, where I also managed the room rental &amp; reservations for the building and supported youth engagement &amp; philanthropy. After a couple years of that, the org re-shuffled and I moved back to the annual campaign side where I helped plan &amp; run the annual telethon and managed the entire direct mail fundraising campaign among other things. A good deal of my work was communicating with event volunteers, running reports, and logistical support for the campaign &amp; the events I managed.

My last two years with the organization I was the Special Events Manager, and handled all of the larger fundraising &amp; community events, this time working from the marketing side, and that was really what I enjoyed most. I got to plan and execute ""parties with a purpose"" as I liked to call them. I worked with our marketing director, a peer on the fundraising side, and the event chairs/committee for each event. We had about 6 - 8 events per year that I worked on, so I always had something in the works... catering &amp; other vendors to coordinate, venue/site visits, lining up guest speakers, and of course messaging/branding for each event.

1. All grad students go through a research ethics class to prevent research that could be of ethical concern. Facial recognition tracking isn't really okay under those guidelines.

2. The research that is being done is specifically being done for systems improvements, and the professor/lab are not using the cameras directly, nor is there any kind of mesh network actually existing - they get video from the GTPD which has been approved by the IRB. They are able to create an evaluation testbed that mimics a edge computing network topology that could be based on the real world camera network that already exists at GT. 

3. The research being done has no application with humans at all. The basis is offloading computational decisions that could be done in the cloud or locally to closeby nodes with limited computational resources for applications that may require low latency, and showing how that could be better than a current system. So, since that information eventually has to make it's way back to cars after operations have been done to data, it really has no place working with people or facial recognition at all.",positive,0.6757,positive,0.1705357142857143,10/31/2019

comments,"Sounds like too much to me.  1553 is an either you get it or you don't class, so it's really hard to know how easy you'll find it.  However, it's probably nothing like any math class you've taken.  The workload is reasonable but you need to spend a lot of time to 'get it', usually. Expect at least a moderate amount of work, and probably a lot more.

I've never taken a class of Zhang's but I actually went to some of his lectures to make up for classes I missed.  He's not great (like, really not great) and Chemistry II lab is just as arduous as Chem I.  It takes hours and hours of lab and it takes hours and hours of writing reports.  The class itself is a whole other monster.  For me, it's endless hours studying and doing homework in this class.

Physics is a tough class.  Physics II is insane, and Physics I is a little less difficult.  Make sure you think the prof will be a good fit for you.  Personally, I spent a lot of time on this class, but that isn't the case for everyone.  I'd say you'll spend more time on chemistry than this class.  Physics II is another story though...

I don't know about genetics.

Long story short, I highly recommend you cut out at least one lab class, maybe two honestly.  With all these classes together you're looking at a pretty merciless semester.  I made the mistake of taking two lab classes and it was really hard to manage.  Personally I think dropping Chem goes a long way because the lab is so tough and the tests are pretty hard too.  But prioritize and just do what also works for you long term.  I would suggest trying your best to get a MWF schedule so that you can work and study on TTR.",positive,0.9004,neutral,-0.020340277777777777,10/31/2019

So, I'm probs not gonna get Chen (cause of my late time ticket), so I was looking up the other professors. However most of available list of professors (Da Rocha, Mayer, Kordek) havent taught this class before, and some of them don't even have a course critique/rate my professor page. So, who would be the best of the 3. There are 2 other lecture sections, but the professors are TBA (when do those usually come out). 

Phys 2212

I've heard Jarrio was not that great and I've had Murray this semester (he's not great, but he's alright), so how's Jiang? He doesn't have a rate my professor either, so idk.

ECE 2026

Any tips on how to succeed in this class? It seems like it's very work heavy. What are office hours like? Which TAs are good (Causey, Coyle, Stuber, Krudyz, Ma, Fekri)? How do I study for the tests?",positive,0.7923,positive,0.18333333333333335,10/31/2019

1.  This point is very interesting to me and if your claim is true ‚Äúinternships are more important‚Äù then wouldn‚Äôt it be easier to stand out and actually LAND the internship opportunities at State vs at Tech where I imagine the recruiters that come pick the cream of the crop. Here at State I believe I can be a ‚ÄúBig fish in a Small pond‚Äù my multivar calc professor helped recruit me into getting an active role in the Math and stat club for example. 

2. Without sounding arrogant as hell: I like to think that through work ethic and passion for a lot of the theory behind CS in general I can manage the workload of a Ms or Bs at tech. 

3. Between Zell Miller and Pell Grant I don‚Äôt pay anything here at State (commuter and low income family ) I‚Äôm not sure how much I would have to pay at Ga tech though. Hmmm  ig another thing is keeping Zell at state would be a lot easier that‚Äôs something I forgot to think about.",positive,0.9655,positive,0.11547619047619048,10/31/2019

The problem is GSU's CS program isn't a target for big companies; companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, etc. probably won't even look at your resume unless you network like hell. Even if you aren't gunning for the best companies, an equivalent GT student will most likely be more competitive than you just because it's GT. 

It doesn't matter how good you are at GSU if the program isn't perceived as prestigious or rigorous as GT's; even if you have a 4.0 vs a GT student with a 3.3, employers know that GT's program is more difficult and will adjust their expectations accordingly. Hell even you say in your last line ""keeping Zell at state would be a lot easier"", employers know that as well.

GT and GSU are just a few miles away from each other so it's not like companies aren't looking at candidates from both schools.",positive,0.8821,positive,0.15178571428571427,10/31/2019

comments,"**Current 2nd year Environmental Engineering student that is looking to switching to either:**

1. Computer Science
2. Electrical Engineering with CS minor

I have been avoiding EnvE classes, so I have only taken general classes. If I do option 1, 16 of my current credits fallthrough. If I do option 2, none of my current credits fallthrough.

I have been pushing off switching because I honestly don't know what I want to do my life, and I can't afford to push it off any further. I need advice on how to make a decision.

I have registration on Friday (Nov 1st), and this is a possible schedule:

* ECE 2020 with Kevin Johnson
* CS 1331 with Stasko
* MATH 2551 with Hao Liu/ maybe Lubinsky
* APPH 1050 with Lesley Baradel  

Any suggestions to add to my schedule? Looking for classes that can show me if I like ECE or CS
