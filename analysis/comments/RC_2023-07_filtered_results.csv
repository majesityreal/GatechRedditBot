comments,"Howdy! 4-year marching band veteran, here.

Just to clarify, we do not have a music degree here the same way that a place like GSU or u[sic]ga would (rivalry aside, though, I will acknowledge that Hodgson is good for a music school). The only degree we offer here in the way of music is Music Technology, which are Bachelors of Science, Master's, and Ph.D degrees. Officially speaking, these are degrees within the College of Sciences, not the College of Liberal Arts, and it is not part of a separate school from the rest of Tech. So if you go in as Music Tech and decide to switch at some point, you should be able to move to just about any major as long as either A) you have enough overlapping credits to transfer to the new degree or B) you don't have enough overlap, but you are willing to put in the extra work for a degree you might actually want.

We absolutely do have various orchestras, concert bands, choirs, percussion ensembles, and a marching band about double the size of a DCI band. The thing is, those are all just classes that amount to extracurricular activities that happen to fulfill your humanities (not social sciences) and free electives. Also, they are not restricted to music tech majors, so anyone from any degree program can join (the majority of my fellow marching band members were actually engineering and science majors!).

If you are still interested in playing with us, here is the GT School of Music [website](https://music.gatech.edu/). Dr. Chaowen Ting is our orchestra director and will be happy to assist you. I am a percussionist, so I cannot speak for any audition process beyond that section, but I'm sure you can email her and ask about it.

comments,"This may vary on your major/concentration

I graduated with BSBA in ‘13 concentrations in accounting and operations.

I have worked in manufacturing finance for my entire 10 year career- so directly what my degree was. I use hardly any of the ‘text book’ knowledge I learned in school.

What I do use is the problem solving tools I used and honed at Tech and the methods for working within a cross-functional team. Tech taught me how to flex when my skills are needed and get the fuck out of the way when someone else is more qualified to exercise their expertise. I also learned how to talk to/work with engineers which a lot of the other finance/accounting staff at my company have no idea how to do. 

My regrets from school include not taking the excel or green belt courses but those cost money and weren’t for credit- so I sincerely hope Tech has integrated more of those curriculums in regular classes.

Short answer: for most jobs, yes

Long answer: In my experience, I am consistently one of the highest performing people on any team that I've been on. I've worked inside and outside my ""industry"" and the skills I learned at Tech have translated to all of them.

Tech requires most people to put in everything they have and then some to get a decent outcome. That forces a lot of helpful life habits like time management, preparation, the ability to handle pressure, etc

Now in full transparency I was not a high achieving student and I have not work at a FANNG, but I really don't want to because everyone that I know that does mildly hates their job. 

I love my job, and I sacrifice having a higher paying salary somewhere else, but I think the skills that were instilled at me out of a necessity at Tech make stand out in a way that benefits me more.

Lower overall salary, but better benefits, consistently high raises, and everyone likes me because they see me as competent and easy to work with.

I AM competent, but there are people that straight up don't know what they're doing or just suck at it and you're often in the same office as they are.",positive,0.9757,positive,0.2596969696969697,07/01/2023

I know a lot of Georgia Tech new grads who suffered from imposter syndrome, and in the workplace, encounter new grads from other schools who are much more confident coming in, and often that confidence serves them better than their knowledge or skill.

GT acts like people will fall all over themselves to hire alums.  That simply is not the case in my experience.  There are a ton of other factors.  Ultimately, no one gives a d\*mn about the school that you went to.  I found that where I am at, they only care about what can you do today for them and how cheap can they get you for in this region.  It helps to have ""friends in court,"" and I had none.  I developed friends and respect for other GT alums, and that has served me very well.  GT outside of the GT bubble didn't do anything for me along those lines because no one knew what it meant.  Sure, it works in a lot of areas, but not where I am at.  Ultimately, I wish that I had known and understood a lot of things about business and how to be successful much earlier in my life.

I'm not against it; I'm reminding you that you've never been to a different secondary school and thus have little reference for the footprint GaTech brings. Colleges talk to one another; indeed; it's the only real advancement in society:

Distinguished Speakers.

Adjunct Professors.

Visiting Scholars.

Same. I'm in a very similar boat.

comments,"Very late to comment on this, but one thing I see often is a direct comparison of tuition costs as though that's realistic.  Remember that room, board, entertainment, travel, books, food, booze, concert tickets, clothes, computers, phone, tech... It's all costs on TOP of tuition, and it makes a big difference in your quality of life, stress level, time available to commit to studying (if you have to work, or work two jobs, to pay rent.). And those costs aren't the same in Atlanta and Boston. And even if they are, it's a significant chunk of money on top of ""just tuition"" that you either have to come up with or pay back.  Add at least another 25k per year to your costs. That might make a difference in your calculation, or it might not. But HS Seniors rarely understand the actual cost of living on your own, or the stress and time suck of trying to work your way through school vs not.  The name on your degree isn't as important as what you get out of it. And you get out of it what you're willing, and have time to, put into it.  It also depends on how good you really are. A middle to bottom pack student at MIT won't get the best internships, offers, and opportunities. You're competing with your classmates for those. On the other hand, of you excel at Tech and lead your class, those ""best opportunities at a lesser school"" might actually be better than the ""mediocre leftovers at a ""better"" school.""   Debt sucks. The name on your degree is a source of pride, not really much else. Nobody gives a shit about your GPA after your first job.  Interviews and offers are made on talking a good game and sounding like you know what you're doing.  Make the most of your opportunities, do interesting things worth listening to, show you're willing to work hard and can contribute, back it up with solid coursework, good project and intern experiences, and seem like a person that would be ok to work long nights with and still have a laugh, and you'll get the job.  You'll come across dumbasses and jerks with both degrees, and you'll come across people who are *definitely* smarter than you from both schools in your career.  My undergrad from GT, and have a Harvard PhD working for me, amongst others. Where your degree came from really doesn't mean shit once you've got two jobs on your resume, other than a personal source of pride and having a reason to root for somebody during football season.  MIT isn't easy, and neither is Tech. Last piece of advice- the best employees are the B students, because they've always had to work at it and nothing came easily.  Surprisingly, A students are surprisingly underachievers in the workforce. It's not about the school or the grade, it's about the application of the person to the task.  Even if you're an A student now- go in there (either school) and bust your ass.

comments,"initially off the bat you'd need to do a post-bacc to fulfil the pre-med requirements if you haven't already – typically 8 credits of bio, gen chem, orgo, physics, maybe some other stuff i can't remember. (anatomy/physiology are not required for med-school admission though, but they certainly are helpful). specific requirements for specific med schools are available on their admissions page

you should also start hone in on the patient-interaction side of things with volunteering, shadowing, etc. you could have the best stats and scores in the world but a lack of patient-interaction will cause you to be rejected. it's one thing to like the machines that help patients but medical school is about the patients directly and not the machines.

med schools won't undermine your application because you're an EE/CS grad at all, they seem really enjoy students from diverse backgrounds like that (according to many Emory SOM grads i've spoken to), but what they want to see is why you made the switch from EE/CS to be pre-med and how your experience in the EE/CS field/skills will make you a suitable physician 

it will take you a few years before you are able to matriculate into medical school based on the post-bacc reqs, the time for shadowing/MCAT prep, and of course the year-long application cycle. 

hopefully that helps a bit, good luck with everything!! the pre-health advising department at Tech is still available to you as an alum and they will walk with you the entire time with questions and advice",positive,0.9881,positive,0.24066416040100252,07/06/2023

comments,"I have mixed feelings about messing with tradition, but we need the money bad.

For some historical context: the original stadium was built in 1913 and the benefactor was a wealthy Georgia Tech trustee who wanted the stadium named after his son who had died as a child in 1905. This was the Grant family, so the venue was named Grant Field.

An historic rename has happened before. McCamish Pavilion was known as Alexander Memorial Coliseum until 2013. Alexander was a Tech football coach and athletic director (Rose Bowl win and 2nd national championship) and the Coliseum was built in 1956 and named in his honor. McCamish was a Tech grad and his family donated $15 million for a  badly-needed renovation and update, so the new facility was renamed in his honor, Hank McCamish Pavillion.  Before that renovation, in the 1990's, there was a pretty big overhaul courtesy of McDonald's, so the site was actually called the McDonald's Center at Alexander Memorial Coliseum for their $5.5 million funding.

All this is to say that we shouldn't get too hung up on names as lesser traditions and lose sight of the storied tradition of Georgia Tech Football, which needs a huge infusion of funding or it's just not going to make it. We need to support J Batt in doing what he was hired to do, build the program back.",positive,0.9832,positive,0.13302139037433156,07/07/2023

comments,"Not an international student, but last year I went to San Francisco with my family. I'm also an instate Georgia peach grown and raised - but while we were walking down market street, twice 2 random people (not bums) shouted something about Georgia Tech from across the street since my dad was wearing a GT sweatshirt. 

Even before that (like 2017), when I was visiting family in Argentina. My mom mentioned something about us living in Georgia to a clerk. Before even finishing her sentence, they sprung up and asked if we knew Georgia Tech - to which my mom said yes, and that my dad is an Alumni. I'm not super sure what happened after that since my Spanish isn't great (something about their cousin just got in I think?), but long story short they talked for ten minutes and my mom walked away with a 15% discount on a new leather handbag.

It's definitely a world renowned school, maybe not on the level of an MIT or CalTech yet ([give it a couple years](http://news.gatech.edu/news/2023/04/25/us-news-world-report-ranks-georgia-tech-among-best-graduate-schools)) - but most importantly the people who need to know we're the shit and our grads are too, do. There's a reason we've earned the nickname ""rambling wrecks from Georgia Tech and helluva engineer."" Not to mention that we've got like a +90% overall career placement rating, and most Tech alums earn +100k at some point in their lives.

Also important to know that those people might just have their heads up their arses (as you pointed out too). I wouldn't be surprised if those same people you were talking to didn't know UC Berkeley or UMich existed either. That or Tech just isn't relevant to their field/expertise. I hadn't heard of Colgate University until I got here and started to meet people from all over, maybe they were just in a similar situation with you too.

But to be fair, Europeans (for reference I did one year of masters in Germany and another in Japan) in general are quite ignorant about the US just as much as the Americans do about Europe and Asia. That being said, Europeans only would know HYPSM, Columbia, MIT, and UC Berkeley (even for Caltech, it's not that well-known). On a side note, I have had European friends (jokingly) say Imperial College in the US is better than GT, except the latter can blow out the former in research money so jokes on them.

comments,"Hello everyone! I am an international computer science student, incoming freshman.

For some background information:

1. I am a beginner in CS, meaning I don't have any previous high school CS courses
2. I am planning to start researching for some job/internship opportunities to help with tuition starting summer first year (obviously not in CS, but looking for other opportunities on/off campus)
3. I want to however optimize my CS ""knowledge""
4. I am not currently involved in LLCs or activities, but hope to do so when I reach campus-if available

Here is my current list. I am quite lost on how to organize it

MATH 1552, CS 1301, ENGL 1101, APPH 1040, CS 1100, HIST 2111

Total 16 credits.

So, how balanced is this list with regards to the above information? Should I focus on completing the core requirements first, and then move on to Major requirements, or should I incorporate some of its courses too?

Also, what are your recommendations of professors?

Please help out if you had a similar experience and please share your suggestions for alternatives!

Realistically, you likely won’t be able to matriculate to med school for at least 2-3 years. At a minimum, most med schools typically require 2 semesters each of bio, gen chem, organic chem, and physics with labs for all of them. Requirements vary, but some ask for additional classes such as biochemistry, psychology, sociology, or humanities. 

To meet these pre-reqs, you probably want to start looking into post-bacc programs right away. These are designed for non-traditional medical school applicants, and are typically 1-2 years on their own. This will depend if you already have some of the credits you need. Some people also choose to DIY a post-bacc, where they enroll somewhere and take pre-req classes outside of a formal program. 

Post-baccs can vary widely in both quality and cost, and attending one at a big name or prestigious institution won’t necessarily help you get into their medical school either. 

Once you have at least some of your pre-reqs knocked out, you can begin to worry about the MCAT. Definitely don’t underestimate this. It’s a 7 hour exam covering a massive amount of content. At a minimum, expect to spend several hundred hours studying. 

These days, the median MCAT score for a MD matriculant is around 512. I don’t know the exact number, but the median for DO schools is slightly lower. 

Aside from taking classes and studying for the MCAT, you’ll also need to start getting clinical experience ASAP. This is one of the top things medical schools look for. Even if you had a 4.0 and a 528, you probably won’t get in without clinical experience. You need a fair number of hours, and it can be really difficult to accumulate them while also taking classes, studying, or working, so the earlier you start, the better

There are two main routes people typically go to obtain clinical experience: paid and volunteer. 

Clinical volunteering is great, but opportunities tend to be limited outside of major hospitals, tasks can often be more administrative than clinical, and it can take a long time to rack up hours this way. 

Paid clinical jobs also have their own drawbacks. Some of the most common ones include CNA, PCT, EMT, Medical Assistant, Phlebotomist, and scribe. These jobs are a great way to rack up tons of patient care hours, but they are also generally very low paying. You can increase your pay by getting licenses and certifications (EMT), but that also takes time and money 

To be honest, for your situation, I would highly recommend looking into clinical research coordinator positions. These are another great way to get clinical hours and pay a lot better than the ones I listed before. I think your research credentials are great and you could almost certainly stay within the field of medical instrumentation. 

Another thing I don’t want to overlook is shadowing. This isn’t as crucial as the MCAT and clinical experience, but it’s definitely still important. I would do this sooner rather than later, as it will help give you some perspective on what it’s like to really be a doctor. 

One last thing I want to mention is volunteering. Most medical schools are service oriented (some much more than others), so you definitely want to have at least some volunteering hours when you apply. This is just another one of those things you need to be a well rounded applicant.

In terms of your actual application, I think you’ll probably be a stellar candidate. From the looks of it, you have great academic and research credentials. Med schools also highly value people who took unconventional paths to medicine. 

Keep in mind that the actual application process also generally takes a full year (submit in June/July, matriculate the following July/August) 

Throughout this all, definitely make sure to utilize pre health advising. They’re super knowledgeable and helpful and will pretty much guide you every step of the way. 

I really hope this helps, and I wish you luck. I would take all this advice with a grain of salt. I’m just another premed, not an admissions officer at a medical school.",positive,0.999,positive,0.1659253968253968,07/08/2023

comments,"The wide-reaching fame of a university is actually unrelated to the quality of the degree, despite how a lot of people treat universities that are renowned. Universities are only really well known based on what higher level research that is done there not the quality of the undergrad experience there. If you are getting a masters or a PHD then it can be a good indicator of how valuable that degree was, and it is a good indicator of how good your options are for doing research during your undergrad degree, but not the curriculum itself. For an undergrad degree the fame of the university may impact people's view of the degree and some interviews, but it doesn't mean you are any smarter for it.

People generally don't know much about colleges. In the US people mostly know ivy league colleges and ones with good football teams. And fame in general is a lot like going viral these days and has less and less to do with the quality of the university and more to do with how often people are exposed to positive news stories about it.

And I'm an American so I don't understand the minds and culture of the EU, but if people don't know about GT then I have a hard time believing that they know universities because of their merit alone, even if they act like it.

comments,"I want the GA Tech folks to read Caleb's obit first. Wrote it this AM:

 

Caleb August Southern of Atlanta, Georgia, passed away peacefully on Thursday, July 6, 2023 at the age of 53. His wife, sister, and a dear family friend were at his side playing Caleb's favorite music. 

Caleb Southern was born in Chapel Hill, NC on December 26, 1969 to father David Southern and mother Susan Naumoff. David and Susan ran a typesetting and graphic design business, and were active in literary, artistic, and NC history circles. Their ramshackle Durham farmhouse, tucked away in the woods, was filled with books, music, and lots of cats. Caleb spent much of his childhood outdoors, climbing giant oak trees to the roof of the house as a toddler and swinging on branches with his Walk Man as a teen.

Music and computers were Caleb’s passions his entire life. At 12-years-old, Caleb earned money to buy his first guitar by picking blackberries in the woods and selling them to a local organic grocery store. Around the same time a close family friend brought Caleb a special gift of a Sinclair ZX 81 Computer kit.  A neighbor who was studying computers at Duke helped Caleb solder the kit together, and that began Caleb’s fascination with computer technology.  

During his time at Jordan High School, Caleb played in his first band, The Ledbetters. He even talked his way into landing a gig at the legendary Cat's Cradle in 1988. The Cradle and its owner Frank Heath would remain a central part of Caleb’s life.

&#x200B;

Caleb only applied to one college, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, winning the prestigious Brooks scholarship. As a UNC student, Caleb continued to play music and was hired as the house sound man at the Cat’s Cradle.  Caleb began recording local bands in the early 1990s, founding Kraptone Studios, where he produced legendary local bands Ben Folds Five, Archers of Loaf, Southern Culture on the Skids, Zen Frisbee, Shark Quest, among others. His production of Whatever and Ever, Amen by Ben Folds Five became a gold record in 1998. With the success of Ben Folds Five, Caleb left college to tour with the band. He later returned to UNC and completed his degree in mathematics and computer science with honors.

By the early 2000's, Caleb shifted his focus to local advocacy, playing a critical role in the revitalization of downtown Durham. He was a founding member of the Arts and Business Council of Downtown Durham, served as a board member of Downtown Durham, Inc., and then sat at the table as a Durham Planning Commissioner. Although he had no formal training in urban planning or public policy, Caleb devised a solution for a 35-year-old transportation problem by proposing a connector that preserved local wildlife and natural spaces, linking North Durham to the Research Triangle Park with the ""East End Connector"" (now called 1-885). In 2002, Caleb won a Citizen Award from the Independent Weekly Magazine for this solution. 

It was during this time, while strolling back to his apartment in downtown Durham, Caleb noticed a sign in the window of a small brick building on Main Street that read, ""Coming Soon! Joe & Jo's Downtown Pub."" Caleb became a Joe & Jo's regular, so much so that co-owner, Jo Worthington, couldn't remember at times if they accidently locked up the pub with Caleb still sitting inside at the bar. In 2004, Caleb and Jo unexpectedly became more than friends and remained together for the rest of his life. Ten years later they made it official and got married in Atlanta. 

At 41 years-old Caleb was accepted into a PHD Program at the prestigious Georgia Institute of Technology in 2010. His research focused on Mobile-Human Computer Interaction, and he created the app Braille Touch, which allows visually-impaired people to text. He was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship in 2012. During his doctoral studies, Caleb discovered a passion for teaching the “crazy smart kids” at GA Tech. He especially loved to mentor students who needed support to feel they belonged. Caleb was beloved as a teacher and in 2022 won the College of Computing Award for Outstanding Instructor.  In March 2023, Caleb served as faculty mentor for the first-place award winning students of the coveted Georgia Tech InVenture Competition. He was exceedingly proud of their achievement.

Caleb was preceded in death by his parents, David Southern and Susan Naumoff. He is survived by wife Josephine ""Jo"" Worthington; his sister, Genevieve Southern; Genevieve’s children, Stella and Max Coleff; Jo's sister Christina Worthington-Rosado, nephew Michael Eifler; and niece Amber Chenault.  Caleb is also survived by Aunts Carolyn Lerner, Elizabeth McCarthy, and Deborah Flynn; Uncle Lawrence Naumoff; Jo’s Parents Tom and Peggy Mobley, numerous cousins, wonderful friends, and his beloved cats, Mr. Stinky and Miss Fuzzy.

comments,"Amidst my tumultuous journey as a non-traditional student, Caleb emerged as a beacon of compassion and understanding, unlike many of the faculty I encountered while at GT. As I navigated personal tempests, he extended his gentle hand, offering solace in a world fraught with uncertainty. He was exemplary. 

When my father's stroke forced me to withdraw from Caleb's course the first time I took it, I returned the second time burdened not only by the looming mortality of my own father but also by my own health battles. An arrhythmia surfaced after I took on the responsibility of caring for my father, a reminder of my own fragile existence. Without insurance, the diagnosis remained elusive, overshadowed by the weight of potential debt.

In our exchanges, Caleb and I touched upon his own past health issues, lightly skimming the surface. Yet, amidst the waves of his lectures, his genuine smiles and animated gestures, I witnessed a profound passion for computing. His happiness seemed inconceivable in light of his own trials.

It was then that I ventured to remark upon his radiance, contrasting it with his personal challenges. Caleb responded with wisdom born of his own confrontation with mortality. Through that experience, he gained an enduring appreciation and love for each day. Waking up to teach a subject he cherished, in a school he adored, became his daily celebration of life.

Caleb, a kind-hearted genius who graced the realms of music and computer science, left an indelible mark. His presence warmed our souls and invited us to embrace his genuine spirit. As we bid farewell to this extraordinary soul, I shall forever carry his memory in my heart.

Rest in peace, dear Caleb. Your wisdom and compassion shall forever inspire, intertwined with the echoes of my own personal battles here on earth.",positive,0.9972,positive,0.255,07/09/2023

His influence on our startup cannot be understated either. He came up with our slogan and helped us develop the flow of our app.

I remember one instance where we had a meeting run longer than 2 hours. He ended up cancelling plans he had with a colleague to continue helping us, a couple naive students. It was then that I knew that Caleb truly cared for his students and would do anything to help.

comments,"I wouldn’t rock the boat too much… yet - this aint working for a restaurant or store where yeah I would threaten legal action by day 4. You may want to have a conversation with HR and probably your manager first before taking legal action - it sounds like you’ve inly just submitted a ticket and are now waiting, give them the chance to respond (5 business days max). Taking legal action obviously has the impact to hurt your reputation, warranted or not, and you may be known by that employer, your peers, and maybe in that industry (when employees move around) as that person who went the legal route over a mistake (given that other interns had been paid promptly) rather than talking it out. 

Now if it’s been a week or more, I’d probably stop working and spend all my time getting to the bottom of not why I wasn’t getting paid. I would also mention to your manager and HR in an email how not getting paid has started to affect your ability to pay bills (assuming it hasn’t already… if it has definitely accelerate the timeline on what I’ve mentioned here). Electronically so you have a copy of notice in the rare case you need it, but likely and hopefully you will not. 

Of course I am not in your shoes, and there are different opinions on this (you should definitely be getting paid!!!)

Sometimes it just takes companies a while to add new hires into the payment system, so I’d give them the benefit of a doubt. Usually by the second paycheck, everything comes on time.

You could tell he loved his students. He lived up to ""there are no stupid questions"" without having to say it. As someone who questioned their place at Georgia Tech, without speaking to me, he made me feel like I belonged and grew my passion for computing. 

I was excited to take him again this Summer for User Interface design. The class was smaller, and I got to speak to him 1-1 a couple times. I'm glad I had that opportunity before he passed. He is the most impactful professor I've had.

Unfortunately, I can't provide you a link as my self assign portal closed last night. Otherwise, I would have totally sent you a screenshot! The way I think GT does housing assignments is they roll wait-lists into groups. 100 isn't great but isn't terrible either. 

If I remember correctly, there were about 7 pages of unassigned rooms listed. So assuming they let y'all in as the next group, there should be quite a few spots to pick from! Housing is all all done through that portal Starrez where you did the application. You'll get an email once GT figures out where you are in line with details about time tickets and dates. If it's any sort of constellation both of my friends (who were in the mid 40's wait-list at the time) got off days before and were able to get a time ticket 30 minutes after mine!

Even MIT or Harvard can't achieve what Penn state can achieve because of a subway running below the ground of Boston. They don't get high resolution pictures while doing microscopy. It's good that Penn state is ranked 83 which is above Georgia tech this time. One of my American cohort told me that us news ranking is not fair as it literally asks department heads about their opinion regarding the ranking of the university which is also not good.",positive,0.9847,positive,0.08622807017543857,07/12/2023

Also, I don't think GTPD has jurisdiction up there as I've **never** seen them in that lot and GT didn't even own it until 2021 or so. Before that, it was overflow parking for restaurants and a general pay to park lot.  You mention people not paying, it would be up to Atlanta PD to go after them.

I didnt mean too many people, that was the wrong statement. Instead I meant that there are a bunch of complaints of them doing too much with too few repercussions for making mistakes. I got no clue if they have too many people or not, you're right to point that out. I was thinking about the number of people because there's a lack of PTS/GTPD/any type of police in the medicine lot.

> You mention people not paying, it would be up to Atlanta PD to go after them. 

I believed this was the case but that doesn't excuse GT here, don't think leaving the lot to their jurisdiction is the smartest move (it's GT property, right? Might be shared with Emory, either way it definitely isn't public). ATL crime map shows thefts from motor vehicles every single night in midtown, and obviously, that's just the stuff that's reported.

As a side note - I remember having these same kind of questions when I first started out on pathway - [so I'd recommend you get in touch with the REP advisor at GSU](https://perimeter.gsu.edu/rep/)! 

Even though they're at perimeter, these are still people who already have a good background connection with GT, and are able to get more specialized and helpful answers out of admissions! Email these guys with your questions instead of GT if they're not being super helpful! Lastly, make sure you take 30+ transferable credit hours to Tech at GSU!

It’s actually less in NF. 

Overall, APS spends over $22k per student. (For reference, I spend $25k for 2 students in private). They additionally spend additional on salaries and bonuses for troubled schools because it is harder to attract and retain teachers in those schools. 

Spending is not the problem of public schools, it’s far more complex and requires new approaches.

comments,"So its my understanding you gave a pathway, the Arts & Sciences Pathway? If you have a pathway offer and meet the requirements for it, they guarantee you a spot. I’m not sure how hard it is to change majors after getting the offer, but on the website they claim to not allow any major change for transfers under any circumstances. That being said, I know people who have transferred and changed majors, so take that with what you will. I played it safe by not doing my pathway because I didn’t want to get locked into a major i hate, but applying normally is also a risk as well. If you want to talk more about applying normally you can DM me!",positive,0.3094,neutral,0.013425925925925916,07/13/2023
comments,"According to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/azo9rw/some_information_all_those_who_were_offered_the/), if you get into Georgia Tech through the Arts & Sciences Pathway as a Computational Media you’re “locked in” to that major and can’t change. I’d email admissions about this because I’m not completely sure—I’m just going off this post. From what I’m gathering from this, you can either go the pathway route and guarantee yourself admissions but for a major you might not prefer. Or take your chances with the competitive transfer pool, where you might not get in, but if you do, you’ll get the major you want. From what I’m seeing you have a 41% chance as a transfer student which isn’t too bad. I hope this helped.

It looks like you might be a prospective new student here at GT. If so, welcome to /r/gatech! Around admission season, we get a huge influx of very common and repeated questions from new students. Usually we pin a Q&A thread for all prospective student questions. Check for this megathread on the subreddit homepage. We also recommend that you try [searching google and the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/cd4gcw) for the answer to your question first.

This is a total of 13 credit hrs. However I’ve heard to not take CS, Chem, and Math in the same semester. Would it be best if I changed CS 1371 to ME 1670?
