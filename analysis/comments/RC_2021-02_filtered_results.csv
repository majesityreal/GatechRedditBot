comments,"Library here: As most have stated, yes the Library is open for students, faculty and staff. Right now you need a BuzzCard to get in. Covid has changed things substantially, but basically you just grab an open seat. It is open 24 hours a day except on break. 

Crosland Tower and Price Gilbert are both ‚Äúthe library.‚Äù Crosland Tower connects to Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons on Grove (ground) level (Clough three) and first floor (Clough four). 

Floors four (of both Price Gilbert and Crosland), six and seven (of Crosland) are quiet. The rest are collaborative floors, but most people just stay quiet. 

There are currently no physical titles in the library. They are all in cold storage off campus in a facility we share with Emory. Simply order them online and they‚Äôll be delivered through contactless pickup. 

The plan was to move about 30,000 volumes back into the library when construction ended in the summer. Covid has postponed that. 

That said, most of our ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù is all online. Nearly all the research most students need is available 24/7 using the online catalog. 

One last thing ‚Äî the collaboration rooms throughout the library and Clough run the gamut of ‚Äúinstant reserve‚Äù to reserving online. It depends on their size and the technology in each space. You can check them all out here: [https://www.library.gatech.edu/spaces](https://www.library.gatech.edu/spaces).

Definitely take a break! Right now is a crazy time for everyone, and your situation sounds especially difficult! I'm sure in the end no one will judge you one bit (no one who matters anyway). 

Focus on your health and happiness first for a little bit, and don't worry at all about how quickly/slowly you go through Tech.

The most important thing overall from college, in the end, is that you really learn and understand the material you're taught (and involve yourself in a variety of other activities to round out your growth as a person). Best to bring yourself back to a good state first, then resume that journey! I'm sure Tech's not the same right now with COVID anyway, so it's a perfect time to take a break. 

Btw after withdrawing, continue reading your textbooks for this semester (at your own pace) &amp; do some lessons from them too--as if you're a student, but without the real deadline stress. Maybe a friend in your classes can send you homework / exams / etc too so you can see them all once through first.

Please don‚Äôt stress yourself before your first day like this comment is encouraging. You don‚Äôt need to grind leetcode yet lol. I literally have not spent more than a few hours on leetcode in all my time at GT. I also don‚Äôt think getting the MSCS 4+1 is that worthwhile either. It won‚Äôt grant you many (or any) more affordances than a BSCS and some experience would. I really only believe you should do the MSCS program if you‚Äôre genuinely interested in learning more, doing research, or simply wanna be here longer and can afford it.

Focus on putting yourself out there when the time comes to look for jobs, and you‚Äôll get something. Be personable, genuine, and cast a wide net. Most freshman don‚Äôt get any internships either, so don‚Äôt sweat it. I have tons of friends who didn‚Äôt get internships til junior year and some who didn‚Äôt get any at all and went straight to fulltime. They all work for great companies now. 

Enjoy your time here, relax and congratulate yourself for getting in. That‚Äôs a great accomplishment! Now focus on doing stuff that interests you (personally, not solely for career gain), and get ready to work hard when your first semester starts.

Yes, it's unfortunate to have this happen but large companies look for interns early in order to prepare for these types of situations.  They still have time to replace you.  Just be truthful, honest, and genuinely apologetic.  They can't really do anything to you and while it's not a great step I doubt they'd ""blacklist"" you or hunt you down over an internship offer.

You can do a linguistics minor through the School of Modern Languages which will give you a lot of foundational linguistics knowledge.

Plus, many masters programs in comp ling ask for some kind of language proficiency so it‚Äôs a good skill to build. There‚Äôs also a couple cool social science research projects in the Liberal Arts schools where you can gain experience in practical applications of NLP. 

Basically, CS makes sense as a major, but you should make it a priority to broaden your horizons in the school of modern languages (and IAC at large) ito sustain your interest in linguistics.",positive,0.9775,positive,0.2728937728937729,02/01/2021

Also, pro tip is that when studying abroad you get to pay in-state tuition, which is like 1/3rd the cost of oos and helped me save money a few semesters.

comments,"All I was saying was ""that's a bit of a generalization"" was also a bit of a generalization.

There is quite a bit of nuance to vaccines and mutations, and so far the numbers reported do show differences between existing covid vaccines and variant strains.

Your comment helped as much as yellajaket's did.

Just because spike proteins exist doesn't mean all strains are prevented by all vaccines. I'm with yellajaket here, I don't think we should be planning ""normal"" until we understand more.

&gt; Laboratories worldwide are racing to understand the threat that emerging coronavirus variants pose for vaccines. But early insights from these studies are mixed and incomplete. A variant identified in late 2020 in South Africa, called 501Y.V2 (also known as variant B.1.351), is among the most worrying. Lab assays have found that it carries mutations that sap the potency of virus-inactivating ‚Äòneutralizing antibodies‚Äô that were made by people who received either the Pfizer or Moderna RNA vaccines.

[Here's a good writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/l3r3pm/how_the_us_news_and_world_reports_nuked_reed/) on what happens to college rankings if they refuse to play the game and opt out of bribing the rankers. TL;DR: Rankings dropped like a lead brick.

The professors at all colleges are good and bad and you attend the institution for the education. Honestly, if colleges were ranked by how well their professors on average teach, top 20s will be populated solely by community colleges.

So take the rankings with a brick of salt and instead compare the average expected tuitions and what is the true differences between the universities. 

The only reason why I'm here and not attending a more local instate uni (with a fuck ton less tuition) is because the number of universities that offer Nuclear Engineering can be counted on one hand and I applied to them all. Gatech was the lowest tuition expected. Post need based grants it was on par with some instates I was considering surprisingly.

Biggest advantages of an MS: 

 \-- get to get deeper into a chosen area, allowing you to both decide whether you like it, and be more attractive to your chosen area.  

\-- If you want to be in a pure research group in a large company, you probably need at least an MS to even get considered

Biggest disadvantage of an MS:

\-- Financially, it is at best a wash immediately, and probably a negative, as you miss a year of industry salary for living expenses, and don't get enough bonus points in your initial salary to come close to making it up.

If you KNOW you want to get your PhD, the MS is not required as an interim step.",positive,0.8366,positive,0.19322344322344323,02/03/2021

Complaining about work isn't all that bad. As long as it's not toxic, it's just good fun mainly. Most courses don't need to be so humorless/serious. I've done well and generally enjoyed my coursework, but I still shitpost about it now and then. It does suck when you have a few toxic people in it who complain in an unwarrantedly mean-spirited way, though.

And i dont think Fauci is talking about a single mask with layers. He literally asks people to wear 2 separate masks. [https://youtu.be/K0gwg0XutVY?t=31](https://youtu.be/K0gwg0XutVY?t=31)

The reality is, online school makes cheating way easier. Students determined to cheat will STILL cheat, leaving honest, OSI-fearing students in the dust. The solution is innovation, not restriction.

Let students use the internet, let students collaborate with their peers - as would happen in real life. Write ORIGINAL tests, with thought-provoking problems that cannot simply be looked up - that measure a student's actual understanding of the material.

Weight tests less. Introduce meaningful assignments and projects that help to enrich the student's understanding of the content. Most things I crammed for an exam I have forgotten. On the other hand, the problems I've solved in an assignment/project stick for much longer.

GT is a top institution. We should be pushing boundaries, and innovating in the field of education faced with a world crisis. Not resorting to authoritarian scare-tactics that, if anything, reduce the effectiveness of education.",positive,0.836,positive,0.24861111111111112,02/04/2021

On the other hand, if these are weighted like normal midterms in your grade, than that is ridiculous. 

As for most people not finishing, your professor will probably notice this and adjust for the second one accordingly. The first time teaching a course (or teaching it online) it can be hard to accurately estimate how long certain tasks will take.

comments,"I'm going to argue for the professor just to put out some different opinions on this thread.

Firstly, concerning the 15 minute limit. Other professors have taken this time crunch testing format (both within and outside of AE). The quiz crunch time can be argued as it prevents kids from just reading their notes and figuring out the problem without ever *really* learning the material. Also, it is a deterrent for cheaters, as this course does not use honorlock or another proctoring software.

Secondly, concerning the 5 minute submission limit. This is actually more common and various professors have used this tight limit to prevent students from working more than the allotted time. The one thing that I will say is quite unfair, is the email submission being deducted points automatically (although one way to potentially get around this would be to email him the exam from your phone within the 5 minute submission window if you see your computer is being very slow).

Thirdly, concerning the exam problem. Yes 15 minutes is a tight window and some people do not work well under this pressure, but the exam was open note AND the exam problem was virtually identical (simpler actually) to a homework problem that in theory everyone had done. 15 minutes was enough time to recognize this and then use the same approach you used for the homework (or just look at the homework solution he already uploaded if you were not sure about your answers).

While as a whole I do agree that these methods are somewhat unreasonable, the professor (same as all of us) is trying to cope and adapt to very odd teaching circumstances and there is no perfect solution. Every professor has come up with their own way to operate this course and I think there has been an exaggeration in the class reaction to this exam.

Finally, remember that a course is 4 months long and there are a lot of grades left which can easily outweigh one bad exam grade. Additionally, this professor is known to curve quite generously so I recommend everyone just calm down a bit and study more if needed.",positive,0.3632,neutral,-0.0017950513538748853,02/05/2021

I've always considered Eddings to be Tolkien Lite.  I do dislike the big omnibus versions of the main series, though.

[SUPER SPOILERS]

That SCIENCE was powerful, and fit towerlight so well, and Navani finally going ""I am worth it"" to Sibling. She was powerful, inside and out. And speaking of power, Jasnah too has always been one my favorites; those last scenes were awesome. Makes me worry for er, memory loss though via super-zealot more-than-mildly-concerning Tavangiar King of the People. I feel for the guy, sort of, but I think he's going to do Dangerous Things.

And Kaladin. Always Kaladin. I love that dude so much, even though he keeps going through so much. I can't tell you how /relieved/ I was when Dalinar first put him off duty. He needed that, even if he himself was upset at it. But poor dude, the rest of the book was so bad for him ‚Äì but then he /did/ it. He got up. Thinking of all those people in the tower taking inspiration from him too really makes me tear up. And R'lain, he was so cool when he stepped up and tried to make order of things, even though he didn't have a spren or any power in that moment or anything, or than being a /bridge/ (though now that I'm thinking that it also kind of hurts, considering Bridge Four, and I wonder if there was anything in that anyway). Lirin and Hesina, those two. There were just a ton of things. That I am gushing about. I sincerely hope you don't mind.

Also, speaking of, if you want to speculate with me, what the heck is Mraize up to? The Ghostbloods really seem like they're just run by some rich dude in another dimension looking for a cure for their illness, or maybe just a group of Stormlight merchants. I don't get these kinds of ""lofty aims"" thing, they really just seem to be making profits off the chaos. Super shady. The entire Cosmere's looking to get involved though soon, and I'm a little worried as to how it'll turn out.

You as an individual have no right to dictate how someone should vote and if you are a citizen of this country, it is your responsibility to recognize that people are going to vote differently than you. In this country, people vote off of legitimate concerns of current issues, and the priority of those issues depends on the person.

I feel like this only makes sense if you come from a background where nothing political actually impacts your safety or well-being besides maybe taxes. In other words, if you're in the majority group for religion, race, gender, and class.

Politically-fervent people are not passionate about politics just for laughs - they usually have something personal at stake. Maybe their rights or their lives.",positive,0.5346,neutral,-0.044805194805194806,02/06/2021
comments,"Preach.

I've had good conversations with individual friends, but I hate it when I see this very insular, scathing rhetoric that paints ""the other side"" as an evil creature of degeneracy (OK, usually less extreme than that, but you get my point) elsewhere. I don't like the two-party system in general, because it often forces you to accept the entire ""package"" of policies and rhetorics even if you really care specifically only about one or two of them; I feel like this is the large contributor to this kind of rhetoric and misunderstanding/lack of willingness to understand. In general, I feel most people think pretty alike (taking a centrist, more nuanced view), but when policies are divided into binaries and echo chambers are becoming more and more predominant due to the internet and info filtering, it can cause this sort of division.

Nuance is hard to communicate simply (and most political rhetoric needs to be simple to be widely accepted...), but it is this nuance that defines good and interesting, and ‚Äì most importantly ‚Äì /productively/ discussions regarding issues. Binary-ism of policy is a fallacy; we must come to reasonable negotiation and an understanding of perspective when discussing societal issues.

Not really, but I also don't think it's demonizing anyone. Tensions are always going to be medium-hot when it comes to politics because it's important. It does matter who other people vote for - because those choices reflect people's worldviews and values. Your values are a big part of how other people see your character. It's not unique to voting; it's universal to human relationships in general. 

As long as voting affects other people's lives (which is pretty much forever), people are going to take it personally. So long as it remains limited to peaceful discourse, things are okay.",positive,0.9578,positive,0.06401785714285715,02/06/2021

One piece of advice I can give you from my 4 years at Tech is stop giving a crap about the grade per say but rather what you get out of the class. Although keeping grades in line is important for the long run I found that when I shifted my mind set to trying to get as much out of the class as possible my grades usually fell in line as a result. For example, I had the most boring class ever but I made it interesting for myself by writing a computer program to do all the homework.

It‚Äôs in the past and you can‚Äôt change it (unless you can submit a regrade lol), so it is important to move forward and think only about how you can change your study technique to improve on future assignments. It is the beginning of the semester, so you may just be experiencing a rougher adjustment period than normal. But if you ever find yourself really stressed and down, just remember that you are a healthy individual with a lot to be thankful for.

comments,"I don't think you should come into Tech too tunnel visioned on a specific idea you have for what kind of GPA you want. This will put a lot of unnecessary stress and pressure on your mental health which will probably prevent you from doing your best. It sounds pretty generic and is probably annoying to hear, but your future depends a lot more on things that aren't related to your GPA. Plenty of people go on to find success in Big Tech without having a perfect GPA. What ultimately matters is making the best out of your time at Tech to grow academically obviously but also as a person! I will say though that personal projects can help a lot in the CS field. If you want to spend your summer doing something to prepare for Tech, I'd recommend working on a personal project that you're passionate for.

comments,"I would suggest weighing the pros and cons of this decision if you can before committing. Moving to a new country is no small feat and making a list of possible risks and benefits can be helpful.

Questions to consider:

What do you plan to study at GT? Is GT known for that subject? Are other schools in the states or in your home country known for that subject?

Do you plan to live in the US after you graduate? Or, do you plan to return to your home country? Are you familiar with US policy towards foreign students? 

Can you or your family afford US tuition rates and cost of living in the Atlanta area? Are you comfortable learning coursework in the English language or will you need ESL support here?

There are other factors, but these are what I came up with off the top of my head. 

As for parents, they can be overbearing, but ultimately they want the best for you. My suggestion is to figure out what they are actually trying to say. Are they worried about losing you if you leave home? Are they unwilling to pay more for your education? Are they anxious that studying in the States will not benefit your future? If you can get them to speak to what they are truly concerned about, maybe you can find a solution that you two can both agree with. 

At the end of the day, you are in control of your life. Do what you think is best for your future, but make sure you weigh your options first before making a big decision.",positive,0.9748,positive,0.1651830808080808,02/08/2021

Teaching undergrads is a necessary evil, distracting these people from their research, for the most part.  I took a leisurely path through my college career where I went to other schools as well as Tech, and the difference in quality of teaching was astonishing.

This professor is not the most chill person however I find they are pretty accommodating, given the circumstances, and the fact that they are handling an extremely large class of students. 

Response to your points:

1. The Trade off with using honorlock: the exams are administered through canvas quizzes and are therefore MOSTLY multiple choice questions, which in this course is a GODSEND. I‚Äôd much rather use honorlock than have to answer long-form questions lmao. 

2. I haven‚Äôt emailed him but If this is true then yes this is a problem. 

3. I haven‚Äôt seen this happen but I‚Äôll give you the benefit of the doubt and agree this is not good. 

4. Yeah this sucks and is technically unfair for students who joined late but hw / quizzes are not worth much. Especially since in class he gives the answer to the quizzes so it‚Äôs not really a quiz, it‚Äôs just an attendance check  

6. I agree his answering style on Piazza is kind of abrasive but tbh when he asks if someone ‚Äúhas even watched the lectures‚Äù (which are from Omscs), their question makes it abundantly clear that they haven‚Äôt. 

7. The class is done such that students watch the omscs lectures and then in class he does example problems. Idk how they‚Äôre supposed to maintain a discussion with a chat box of 130+ live students. 

8. What‚Äôs an anonymous feedback channel? Apart from CIOS surveys I‚Äôve never heard of a professor maintaining an anonymous feedback channel during the semester. 

I‚Äôm with you on the fact that this class is not fun. But I do not think the professor is as bad as you make them out to be.

One of them would maybe be able to get out of the suit, but normally both would be sued in order to get to the discovery phase and determine whether one or both were at fault. Some things to note:

- GDPR is probably not applicable in a legal sense to your situation, since it is European law covering European data subjects and European data processing. However, many processors follow an operational framework that is GDPR-compliant (such as pointing you to GT to answer your inquiry) since it is the 800-pound gorilla of data protection laws. It's just easier to follow it for all operations globally, regardless of which records it applies to.

- Almost any lawsuit regarding a data breach would have to be a class action since it is not economically feasible to pursue these sorts of claims on an individual basis. 

- Unless they have some sensitive data on you, such as SSN, banking info, account access credentials, or medical info, or unless they have broken a law that provides statutory damages, a breach will probably not lead to a right to any sort of substantial monetary relief. If all they are storing is the sort of info you can find in a phone book or via a simple google search, then there isn't a big risk to you in case of a breach, and therefore you probably couldn't get a lawyer to agree to take a case.",positive,0.3805,positive,0.059285714285714296,02/09/2021

My point about GDPR is that many companies are shaping their protocols and security measures in a way to be compliant with GDPR, but that doesn't necessarily mean that anyone can enforce GDPR against them. You can only enforce the law that applies to your situation.",positive,0.6369,positive,0.14107142857142857,02/09/2021

From when I got in (2017) to now, I can say a lot has gotten better, and that the current ECE administration has been working hard to improve the quality of student life for CmpE and EE majors. For instance, they are constantly seeking student feedback on what to improve through town halls. They also are redesigning/modernizing the curriculum and making it easier for CmpE students to take classes in the CS department (which is usually hard because the classes are major-restricted to CS majors).

comments,"This is a reply from the professor that you publicly named.  I'm sorry you're having a hard time, but I don't appreciate you publicly shaming me.  I do care about teaching and spend significant time on it.

1. Yes, I made it clear at the beginning of the course that we will likely use HonorLock.  I also said that in the course description in Oscar.  Isn't it good that I made it clear beforehand?  Are there other approaches besides HonorLock; yes there are (e.g., we tried Gradescope lockdown browser but it is incompatible with Linux).  But I am concerned with students posting to Chegg during the exam or communicating with each other, so isn't HonorLock a reasonable approach to use?
2. Yes, I prefer Gmail to Outlook.  But you can easily find my gatech address, you just start typing my name in Outlook and it shows up.  And many students contact me in that way, that's fine.  For the class I said that I prefer private posts on Piazza to communicate with the TAs and I, so that it's easier to keep track of things; it's a large class.
3. I looked at the Piazza post you mentioned.  I replied:  ""I agree with you &lt;first name&gt;""  It was a mistake to include their first name.  Sorry, I didn't think about it.  Their name is shown to me and I replied like I would to an email without thinking about it.  I didn't criticize the student at all, I thought it was a good post.  Also, the student was in my office hours a few hours earlier asking about the same thing (and their full name was shown in the BlueJeans call).
4. There is a quiz posted in every lecture, they are easy and quick if you attend class, and you can do them anytime that day.  Actually in some of the first few classes I asked students to do the quizzes during class.  I also extended the due dates on several of the initial ones.  Several students registered for the class late and contacted me right away.  We let them makeup the quizzes (which we need to do on an individual basis).  You contacted me several days later and then when I checked your Gradescope it showed that you did the first quiz but not the later ones and you were registered the whole time, so is it so unreasonable that I didn't allow you to make it up?  I did reply to your private Piazza post to say no and explain why, then you replied back to that; is that ghosting if I stop replying at that point?
5. I posted a practice exam to HonorLock and was bugging everyone to take it so you could test the system before the real exam.  I don't have access to personally try HonorLock.  I have no way to help with technical problems with HonorLock.  What are you complaining about here?
6. From what I recall someone asked what I mean by prefixes.  The topic for several lectures is dynamic programming and in my lecture videos I keep talking over and over with many examples about prefixes.  So is it so rude to ask if they've watched the lecture videos?  Perhaps, but you can understand that it's a bit frustrating to me.  Note these videos took me a very long time to make for the OMS program.
7. I actually think I've been doing a good job with the lecture time given the situation.  I have good (in my opinion) lecture videos prerecorded, and I'm using the lecture time to do practice problems in a flipped classroom manner.  I'm trying to watch the BlueJeans chat during class, which is quite challenging with a large class.  Can I do it in a better way?  Perhaps, but I'm trying and this is new for me as well.  
8. Apparently you can send anonymous comments to any instructor via Canvas, a student just did so to me today.  But in any case you have made me aware of your complaints. Will I penalize you?  Of course not.  Also, all of the grading is done in an anonymous manner (as much as we can do so).

I'm sorry you had such trouble.  But I don't appreciate you publicly naming me in this manner, these posts stay on the internet forever.  Best of luck.",positive,0.9478,positive,0.10144337280366694,02/09/2021

Granted, both focus on undergrad, I can't find a specific analysis of graduate school.

I've always heard it rises as unemployment causes people to (a) want to invest that time in _something_ and (b) prevent a time hole on their resume.

I feel like this recession is just different since graduate school usually entails relocating, which is less likely to be doable during a pandemic.

I actually like the way he solves practice problems during live lectures as it gives me better understanding of the materials he covered in his recorded videos. He did answer to most if not all questions in the chat during the live lectures though. His exam is also fair, and I think anyone can attest to this.

honestly, having an anonymous to all feedback channel on piazza would really help. like there was no discussion about honorlock or why use it other than it is what it is. there are very well documented threads &amp; articles on how honorlock is the worst thing in existence and many many professors have found innovative and more mentally relaxing ways to administer similar content classes. similarly, there‚Äôs no opportunity to provide feedback that might be possible to be addressed in this or future iterations of class for benefit of all.

comments,"East is closer to NAV dining hall and Brittain. East is also closer to Bobby Dodd stadium, Barnes and Nobles and the library. I lived in east for two years and I  liked it. It seemed to be close to most of my classes and events (including Greek ones)

West is closer to the CRC and Stamps medical center. West has eating options such as Wing Zone and West Village.

Overall, it comes down to what your intentions are. I like east because it is more lively, has most of my friends and is closer to popular buildings like the library and CULC.

If your are an incoming freshman, the best dorms are considered to be Glenn and Towers, which are both on East. The rest of the dorms on East are pretty much the same quality as West. I lived in Smith and I personally thought it was way better than what most people described it as. From what my friends at Woody's have said, they did not seem to like it too much.

comments,"I lived on West campus freshman year, East sophomore, and back on West for junior and senior year. I‚Äôm obviously a bit biased but I highly recommend West. West Village is the newest dining hall and has the highest quality food (which admittedly is still not that great) and is close to the CRC and more green spaces like the Burger Bowl and Stamps field as well as the music buildings as you mentioned. It‚Äôs much more relaxed, scenic, and quiet than East campus in my opinion.

In terms of dorm quality I was confused why Woody‚Äôs was being referenced and just learned that it is now a freshman dorm? I checked web archive and it looks like this is the first year they‚Äôre doing this; before it was only part the undergrad program and freshman could not live there. I half suspect that it may revert to that next semester since the school was trying to spread out freshman as much as possible with COVID. This building is suite style which is different than all other freshman dorm options. Ignoring Woody‚Äôs (which does kinda suck), West campus honestly has the better housing options. Glenn and Towers are overhyped since they are actually the smallest dorm rooms on campus (you can see room dimensions for each building online). To my knowledge (from my research freshman year) the largest dorm size on East is actually smaller than the smallest dorm size on West. Of course the differences are on the scale of inches or a foot in each dimension so take that as you will. Fitten is one of the nicest on West and underwent a renovation similar to Glenn &amp; Towers just a couple years prior.

Overall I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be happy on either side and I know many have had great experiences with both but... WEST &gt; EAST",positive,0.9893,positive,0.17679112554112555,02/10/2021

2. Agreed. This shouldn't happen. But I think it's a genuine mistake. Instructors can see who posted the message. 

3. This was unacceptable. 

4. Again, so what? How is anyone going to help you when you have a technical difficulty during a 75 min exam? The mandatory Honorlock practice test was to ensure that this doesn't happen. 

5. The lectures are good. Do you expect to be spoon-fed? He does practice problems in the class based on his OMSCS lectures. Gotta do our part!

6. This is silly. Come on! This is a grad school. What are you complaining about here? The solutions only seem arbitrary when you do not put in the effort. I was struggling with some of the content and had to spend days to figure stuff out. It's a class on algorithms. And DP is hard to crack anyway. I don't know anyone who got the intuition for it just by watching lectures. Plus, the professor spent a lot of time on DP in class - more than he stated in the syllabus. 

7. It's one complaint after the other about random things. What feedback channel are you talking about? CIOS surveys are there for this very reason. In my 2 years at Tech, I have had only one class where I had any other anonymous feedback channel.

The other 1 about the email addressss. - Yep, agreed this is bad. But you can easily find his address on outlook. Are you complaining about not pressing a few  buttons on outlook to find his GaTech email address?

About a 10 min walk from Crosland. Its quite risky tho since ive heard of cars getting broken into if left overnight (don't know how often). Some safety tips: 

Try to leave campus before nightfall when there are still people around. The area is relatively sus.

Hide your valuables or take them with you. Don't leave any spare change, chargers, shoes, or anything someone else could even remotely want.

Park on the big streets that connect the two main roads. The side streets that connect the big streets are not well lit and I'm assuming this is where potential break-ins and robberies happen. Also, try to park on the ends of the streets that are closer to the main roads- these are usually taken up by afternoon but if you can't find any by SunTrust, go to the next big street (it'll increase your walk by 1-2 mins but its worth it).

comments,"Ayy this is something I can give some info on. 

GT was pursuing an RFP last year for their transportation system, which is essentially the process of deciding who they would contract bus and other transportation services out to. Amidst COVID, this ended up getting called off, and because of that GT was able to switch to self-operated bus services instead of contracting out (similar to what they're doing with dining) beginning next year. 

They can't immediately install an electric fleet because they don't have the infrastructure to be able to charge them and such at the bus yard, but they're going to be slowly working towards adding hybrid-electric buses over the next few years while also trying to get fully electric buses added later on once the infrastructure is in place. UGA got some federal grants which allowed them to switch as early as they did, so that and the old bus contract is why GT lags behind a bit (on top of not having proper infrastructure). 

GT PTS presented their budget to the Mandatory Student Fee Advisory Committee (MSFAC) a few months back, and it looks like the slides on the MSFAC website have some additional info if you're interested: [http://www.budgets.gatech.edu/File?F=MSFAC%2F22MSFAC%20Transportation-Presentation%28FY22%29.pdf](http://www.budgets.gatech.edu/File?F=MSFAC%2F22MSFAC%20Transportation-Presentation%28FY22%29.pdf)",positive,0.9598,neutral,-0.0011904761904761969,02/10/2021

1. Ivy League schools and other private schools are much more well established. GT only recently became a top school so it doesn't have the same level of alum network/startup resources.

2. Many lists of ""top disruptors"" and stuff of that sort are highly dependent on many factors that have more to do with level of access to higher level people in industry than inherent quality of the ""disruption"". The profile of the average Ivy League student's background makes them much more likely to have access to industry elites.

3. Generally the people who are able to be startup founders out of college or the ones who have the ability to take years of working time off to try a new idea are the ones who have the privledge to be able to take large financial risks and still be fine.

comments,"Woodies (West campus) is ancient with mold filled ventilation and a humidity so high during the summer that a pool of water emerged every night on the ground of my dorm. Got a dehumidifier and it would fill every 2 hours; the container held 4 or 5 gallons.

On the flip side, the water pressure followed similarly ancient regulations. Water pressure was glorious. It looked like the builders just hooked up the water line directly to the city main. A roommate bought one of those 4 square foot area showerheads, the entire upper wall looked like an ultra tall silver breadboard. 

We hooked it up and the wall looked like it just opened to the water dimension. The pre-existing showerhead felt like a needle, honestly painful if you stand too close but this was heavenly. Singlehandedly held off depression from the half hour long showers / swims I had every morning and evening. I come from southern california so this was a whole new experience for me.

The water temperatures came straight from a literal gas fired boiler on the first floor and you could make ramen from it, if it didnt also look like it came straight from Flint Michigan on some days. Dont recommend drinking the water regardless.

On a side note, Woodies power is connected to the main Atlanta grid, Georgia Tech itself has its own power transformer. There was one day when the power on campus went out due to some transformer issue but Woodies stood alone as the only building still powered. Pretty funny.

comments,"PTS sucks, but for anyone living (or even considering it) in the Tech square area I want to take a moment to shit on the company that runs the Centergy parking deck (E82) too. Every interaction with them has been like pulling teeth. 

For context, E82 is not owned by tech, they lease space from the company that owns it. The management company has their own access system that keeps track of whether your car is inside or outside of the garage to prevent letting multiple cars in using one pass.

1. It took a week and several phone calls after buying my permit for the Centergy deck company to bother adding my pass to their system. They wanted me to pay the daily rate to access the garage in the meantime.
2. My car battery died and needed a jump. I asked if they could help and they basically told me to piss off. My pass let my girlfriend's car into the garage (even though my car was already inside), so we used that to jump mine. After 10 minutes we went to leave and the garage would only let one of us out. They held my car hostage for days, trying to force me to pay $50 for a ""lost ticket"" to be let out. They wouldn't budge so I had to find a way to sneak my car out for free.
3. A power outage messed up their system and reset the status of who was inside the garage. I got locked inside again because of this, and again they wanted me to pay for a lost ticket to get out. Nevermind the hundreds I spent on the permit in the first place.
4. They will never give you contact information if you have any problems. I had to track down managers and supervisors myself because the parking attendants can't help and don't know who can.

Last year I bought my permit through Square on Fifth which meant I dealt directly with the shitty Centergy deck company. This year I bought my permit through GT PTS who are acting as a middlemen and so far things have been way smoother. They follow up on issues with Centergy for me. The PTS dispatchers have at least treated me as a fellow human being rather than an inconvenient barrier between them and my money. 

If you plan to live in Square on Fifth or anywhere else around tech square, I recommend you avoid buying a pass for E82 if possible. If you must park in E82, buy the permit through GT rather than your apartment building. You'll be double teamed by PTS and Centergy, but daddy Buzz will at least make sure you're fucked gently. 

I thought PTS set a low bar but damn, apparently parking management companies in general are scum.

The one redeeming factor of E82 for EV owners: EV charging is free whereas charging at PTS-owned chargers costs money.",negative,-0.9645,neutral,0.013462752525252527,02/11/2021

Only thing is that I think they evenly distribute the fees to ALL students so it‚Äôs affordable for everyone (dumb ik, but if only 1/4 of the student body chooses to make use of the fees currently and they have just those students who use the facilities pay extra, the fees would be a lot higher, making even less students want to pay to go) with consideration to operating costs.

comments,"I don't think you should be so downvoted. It's a good point to bring up and consider. 

Last I heard, the enviromental impact of /manufacturing/ electric cars was still pretty big ‚Äì but if the car is used for long enough, the lesser-environmental impact of electricity over gas finally evens out (and this /is/ more efficient because even though a lot of the electricity is still sourced from petroleum, it's done a lot more efficiently in large factories than in our less efficient mini-factory cars). When you use the car enough, then finally you get environmental benefits (assuming you aren't suddenly driving a lot more just because your car's now electric). High initial environmental cost, then slow accumulating benefit afterwards.

I feel like if busses are long-term and carry a lot of passengers a lot and on a day-to-say basis, used a lot and for a lot of people, it's the most optimal place to have an electric vehicle.

If youre a grad student, GLC isnt a bad choice. Many grad students live there, however it's slowly getting invaded by undergrads. Your packages are delivered right to the lobby. Green bus stop is right in front of the entrance. However, crossing the street to get to campus can be pretty unsafe and I wouldnt recommend walking outside with valuables late at night.

comments,"Thoughts on the situation-specific/peer pressure angle of this: I answered in some ways that I don't think the survey took into account. For example, if I'm walking outdoors and not encountering other people, I don't usually wear a mask, especially in the summer, due to the lack of risk. But if I start encountering people, I'll put my mask on, not because them wearing masks guilts me into it, but because I am now in a risky situation being exposed to people. I have noticed this with people running outdoors on campus - they put on a mask if they get near people, and take it off otherwise. It's a safety thing, not a peer pressure thing.

It works the opposite way too - if I'm at the library and people are taking off their masks, I'm not going to get peer-pressured into taking mine off, I'm more likely to keep mine on to protect myself! This scenario should at least be visible from the results, but I think that the results from the first scenario I described could create false data patterns.",negative,-0.2244,neutral,-0.03181818181818183,02/12/2021

comments,"Good question!

I have thought from the beginning that the supply rollout would not be linear, however, I am a bit surprised that this part of the ramp up has been this slow.  Nevertheless, we're hearing that supply will be dramatically different by late March.  I was told today that, ""there would be so much that we'd be tripping over it.""  I think there is a bit of hyperbole there, but the time-frame is consistent with other supply projections that we've heard.  As such, it is hard to project how long it will take to transition between phases beyond the transition to 1B.  The 1A+ to 1B transition was expected to be longer than other transitions, so it shouldn't be used to project how long it will take to get to Phase 2. 

The other factor is the imminent EUA for J&amp;J's vaccine.  That introduces several different factors, including only needing a single dose.

All that said, our goal has not changed.  We're planning 1B to push out vaccines quickly and efficiently so that if transitions to other phases are shorter, we're able to start those as soon as they are open.

1. Total research, of which GTRI constitutes \~60%, absolutely matters for our institutional profile. For example, we were admitted to AAU in 2011, which I doubt would've been possible without GTRI. GTRI also creates excellent opportunities for our students, which is a selling point to attract the best and brightest. That indirectly helps to improve our institutional profile. 
2. However, there is a pretty firm wall between GTRI and RI, so I would be surprised if it affects our academic rankings. I'll be the first to say US News is garbage, but it's also knowable information to see what impact, if any, GTRI could have on our rankings.",positive,0.9322,positive,0.2168067226890756,02/12/2021

""Following the presentation of the Alum-  ni Exceptional Achievement Awards  Jacques Y. Cousteau delivered the Con-  vocation address. The main concern  Cousteau relayed was for his audience to  realize their ""duty"" to use technology to  help those ""with no opportunity."" He also  commented that the quality of living and  progress in the technological countries  ""is contrasting violently with the stagna-  tion of three quarters of the world.  ""We have a duty, a duty that you, the  young students, must think about: to turn  to technology not only to our glory and  our pleasure, but also to the tremendous  necessity of people who are starving, of  people who don't even know how to raise  children with no opportunity whatsoever.""  In his conclusions, Cousteau sug-  gested adapting technology for the  underdeveloped countries. ""Pick the  latest Western technology . . . try to make  it simple, inexpensive and available for  those people."" ""

Regarding the police: There are police who try and police who don't give a shit and abuse the system. That's up to the people level. The real problem, however, lies with the systematic training of policeman and the level of quality checks on their actions (i.e. the sheer power they hold and potential for abuse, for confiscating equipment, etc). Currently the way the system is set up can encourage or allow these ""bad apples"" ‚Äì that's the real issue to target, to my understanding, rather than targeting the people as a whole. On a case-by-case basis, some people do still try. I'm optimistic and hope that discussion over current issues and policy will lead things towards the better in the future, system-wise.

Regarding the police and the PTS: I won't pretend that the individual people on the ground will reform the system itself significantly. The issue I took with the original comment however is that it was targeted specifically at the /people/ just hired to be there (for PTS), rather than the system itself. It's a job. The people working there are just living their lives. 

If they aren't management itself, then telling them that their job is worthless and that they should quit serves no productive purpose other than to shit on them. It doesn't acknowledge the cases they /do/ handle successfully, reducing fines for students after they argue the case, trying to figure out what is fair. For the people that do make an effort, seeing something like this is a slap in the face. For those people, I wanted to make a comment to acknowledge that.

Didn't they look at your argument, take the effort to sift through the evidence, say, ""let's be more fair to that person"", and then lowered the fine? There are people with that kind of job working there too.

It reminds me of when my friend had some difficulty getting an excuse for missing classes for his grandmother's funneral. We were both frustrated and thought they were stupid. This is obviously a different case, but it turns out when he actually called them they were super friendly, tried to get it through as quickly as possible, and they said they actually had a ton of fake reports which is why the initial requirements for getting the excuse had been overly convoluted. I felt pretty embarrassed for thinking of them badly afterwards. Obviously, his later good experience was due to the specific person on the phone, who tried to be helpful to him. They turned a possibly negative interaction into a good one, regardless of the system itself.

I won't pretend that the individual people on the ground will reform the system itself significantly. They can only bring about good specific case-by-case interactions.

The issue I took with the original comment is that it was targeted specifically at the /people/ just hired to be there (for PTS), rather than the system itself. It's a job. The people working there are just living their lives. 

If they aren't management itself, then telling them that their job is worthless and that they should quit serves no productive purpose other than to shit on them. If they are management, the only possible reaction to this comment is to make the mean ones meaner and the ones who are trying pretty damn dejected at the hate they are getting.

For the people that do make an effort, seeing something like this is a slap in the face. For those people, I wanted to make a comment to counter that attitude, because it's just not true. People have reasons to be in whatever job they are in, they just can try to make the most out of it while they are there. Unless they have a better opportunity elsewhere, they probably shouldn't just quit because their system has problems with it. If so, I think 90% of the world would be out of a job!

Edit: I don't mean to hit on you for it, I've been stung enough by PTS to understand your feeling, but I just want to say it's good to acknowledge the individual efforts of people too.

comments,"Ok this will be involved, but it may save you some headache if you do it right.

The Standard Atlanta back in 2018 was the worst about saying it‚Äôll be done, and then realizing a month before class start that they would have only 30% of the rooms ready. It turns out in the fine print of the lease agreement, they offered students ‚Äúhousing credit‚Äù if they weren‚Äôt done with their room on time. This housing credit was just word play for saying ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to pay rent because your room isn‚Äôt done yet‚Äù. Luckily they let people choose to drop their whole year long lease and many did. So read the lease agreement carefully, and ask about anything regarding specifically what they offer if your room is not done in time. Many people thought the standard was supposed to find them housing at a hotel or something during the interim, that was all fiction. 

On top of that, many of these off campus apartments in the lease agreement will say ‚Äúwe are not obligated to provide any amenities‚Äù or something like that. So go into this with the understanding that even if your room is done, things like the swimming pool or study area or gym or whatever they claim to offer may not be done or ready to use on move in, maybe not even for months after move in as with the Standard‚Äôs case. Same with The Mark on move in. Many advertised features were not available until many months later (butterflyMX, golf simulator, even just the poolside grills took a month to get working). 

So you‚Äôre getting a good price, but be prepared to get potentially shafted or underwhelmed. 

That said, if all you care about is a nice new room and kitchen and such, [this](https://app.oxblue.com/open/landmarkproperties/dashboard) is how you can estimate if the construction will be done on time.

You can go by date and see what the progress pictures of the construction of these student housing buildings were like. It was useful for the Mark construction as all I had to do was compare the images of the Standard in March 2018 and the Mark in March 2020 to get a relative sense of where construction was at prior to signing a lease. The standard being not done in time, the mark for the most part was. 

I am assuming same or similar construction methods, architecture of the buildings were the same, etc. so try to find an apartment building similar to what yours will look like, match up the dates prior to completion (or supposed completion for catalyst) and then extrapolate. 

Good luck",positive,0.9974,positive,0.16395312005068102,02/12/2021

There was a similar set of funds in the latest stimulus package. As of now, Tech has not yet distributed these funds to students.

comments,"I'll start by saying that I deeply sympathize with your situation and agree that billable hours are not as clearly communicated as they should be. If your scholarship sponsor requires you be taking a full-time volume of classes for them to pay for, I'd say it's going to be almost certainly impossible to get them to pay it this semester.

I know that's disappointing, but here are a few points that might help explain what's happening:

-	The distinction of billable credit hours matters from the perspective of your sponsor.

Your scholarship is meant to pay for the expense of tuition incurred by taking classes at Tech. Said another way, it's to pay for substantive things purchased from Tech (e.g. instruction). In the case of things like the common internships **not** for degree credit, Tech isn't really charging you for anything substantive there, so there's nothing to pay for with regard to those hours.

Now, your internship *is* giving you credit towards a minor, so that part is, evidently, considered billable since those degree credits *are* something Tech substantively provides and is charging you for. However, the optional supplemental course sounds like it may be primarily concerned with your experience on the job, not just working towards something provided at a ""cost"" to Tech, and thus isn't something they fully charge you for (since Tech isn't directly ""providing"" all of it, if that makes sense). I can't say for certain without knowing what specific course this is since I'm unfamiliar with that dynamic, but that's my guess.

-	Tuition has always worked that way. It's not a new COVID thing.

I think you may be confusing summer tuition for fall/spring tuition. Tech has always (as far back as the Bursar site has up, at least) charged flat rates for 1-6 and &gt;6 hours in fall/spring semesters (see the [Fall 2018](http://www.bursar.gatech.edu/student/tuition/FY_2019/FY19-all_fees.pdf) [PDF], for example). By contrast, ever since 2018, summer is billed per credit hour under 15 total hours and a flat rate for 15+ ([Summer 2019](http://www.bursar.gatech.edu/student/tuition/su19-all_fees.pdf) [PDF], for example).

-	A note on why they insist on drawing the line at 12 billable hours.

This *does* have the unfortunate effect of creating that finaid gap in the 7-11 hours zone where you're paying the same but not considered full-time, but it's not new. The thing is that [federal law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/668.2) requires that schools set their definition of full-time student, at a minimum, 12 hours for *federal aid* under Title IV of the HEA, but universities generally just stick with that for *all aid* presumably to keep it simple. So, good luck getting them to make an exception there.

This is all to say that I agree that the concept of billable hours isn't immediately intuitive/obvious, and they probably should've made it more clear that your optional complementary course isn't entirely billable. Students sometimes make a similar mistake in assuming that recitations count towards eligibility, for example. However, the unfortunate reality is that this is the way billing works, and I hope this comment helps you understand the way they're forced to look at it, even though it doesn't help you.",positive,0.9902,neutral,-0.03496307613954672,02/14/2021

4-person/4-room apartments tend to be more expensive and more in demand, I think.

Generally, it might be trickier for you since you are a freshman and you get later time tickets for housing, I believe, than other parties. You basically have to try to register as soon as the first one of your group's time tickets open and have a game plan down to the minute for adding roommates. Talking to some dorm administrator may help too; they aren't scary people. Usually. :))

comments,"In practice, the LLCs give you a chance to register for LLC-reserved sections of classes like GT1000 (seminar intro class for freshman), have specific events relevant to their LLC ""topic"" (sort of like dorm events but with a more specific theme) , and you live in the same building. You get what you make of it. Grand Challenges at least I know is a more active, tight-knit community than the LLC I was in(at least from what I've heard), because I think you really put work in to do some projects together with your dormmates. No idea about the Honors Program, I've heard people mention they were in it but not expand on it much further ‚Äì I guess it's just a good chance to dorm up with other academically-focused, smart people, because even at GT you really get all kinds (even if on average we are more nerdy than other schools). 

Generally, LLC's might be a good way to attract people with a similar interest as you ‚Äì because if you applied for it liking the idea for some fundamental reason, odds are the other people applying also liked it for some fundamental reason too and you've found someone you can relate to. Most of the people you meet as a freshman and on are usually through your dorms, clubs, or classes (or communal bathroom interactions, honestly), so a LLC is a good tactic for finding people you'll probably like. I did meet two of my good friends at GT in my LLC dorm, and we've stuck with each other since.

tl;dr: Basically, an LLC gives you more opportunities and sign-ups for community bonding and LLC-oriented classes. Hope that's helpful.",positive,0.9972,positive,0.20522862554112553,02/14/2021

comments,"I think there is a 1-credit hour seminar class called GT2000 for transfer students. It might be helpful for easing in and getting in touch with GT's resources.

My rundown of GT's highlights/resources:

- GT is great for career and research, and building practical applications/connections as you go on. See career resources category below.

- Academics are a little more eh in my opinion, they are definitely much more rigorous and can be more unintuitively taught. This means you might have to supplement learning in class with outside more concept-based videos like 3blue1brown on youtube (glorious math youtuber). Also tutoring resources may be helpful to you if you're struggling with a class ‚Äì there are a lot of them out there. Office Hours also aren't as terrifying as they sound and some professors hold chill office hours where everyone can just come and work on HW. 

- Skills: time management and work-life balance. This is a thing you hear all the time, but I'll put my own spin on it. You likely /will/ have trouble with this ‚Äì so if you ever get overwhelmed, take a step back, plan your next step one small step at a time, then also make sure to have fun every once in a while (clubs, like ORGT, are very good for fun). You can't keep working like a robot forever, if you don't do fun things and enjoy life you will burn out. Remember this, and take things one step a time, learn what works for you. 

- Warning: some classes may seem really easy the first two weeks and then will eat you up inside if you stop paying attention because of that, because they can accelerate /fast/. Watching lectures is always a good idea, even if just to know what topic you are on and general announcements that might not be posted on Canvas (the learning management software). Especially with things being online, it's very tempting to not do this.

- Apartments: 
  - Inside campus: 4-apartment dorms are nice, but somewhat pricey ($1000+/mo). Suites (two 2-person bedrooms connected by a bathroom) are decent. Two-person dorm rooms (~$760/mo) are basically the freshman experience. A lot depends on if you know anyone else.

  - Outside campus: UH Midtown is a classic choice, but very pricey (for a room in 2BD2BR, its ~1400/mo). People put up with this due to convenience, close location, and the fact that UH holds roommates responsible for their own rent rather than only one rentee. If you have someone you can trust to split the rent with, there are better and cheaper options. You can get cheap housing in Home Park (which some people, however, have safety concerns about but I think it's okay), or other apartments like 1016 Lofts (~1700/mo, split between two people). You can do a bit of hunting on Trulia, the GT Housing facebook group, or the GT Thrift Shop facebook group to find better apartment deals. I believe you can just look up all of those online. In particular, I think the Facebook groups offer good deals, and you can probably meet with the GT student renters to see if you can actually live with them beforehand.



CAREER RESOURCES:

- CareerBuzz is great for finding an internship/co-op. Some companies may have specifically partnered with GT to get listed, so GT's credibility could help you get a job through that portal. I would subscribe to ""relevant job alerts"" so that they will send you an email/notification about any new job postings that are relevant to you, so you don't have to research them yourself. Also: whenever you apply for a job check the company's rep on indeed.com or glassdoor; that's just a good tip in general. You want to know what previous employee's thought about the company and if that matches what you want.

- GT is also great in research opportunities. Your major's department will likely post research opportunities in your major, either through a newsletter, email list, or their website.

- I wouldn't worry about these too much however just coming in. Get used to it for a semester or two, but try to pay attention to these things when you have time. CareerBuzz has a bunch of workshops they post out on their calendar; they are actually good and useful to attend and let you be able to plan a little more flexibly, since you know what's going on and what you need to do.

- Speaking of workshops and calendars, there's a GT calendar that lists all upcoming lectures, workshops, student events, etc. I've found this highly useful when I've found inspiration to learn things outside of my classes. They have cybersecurity, chemistry research, materials science, etc.,  lectures present and it's a good way to see what real-world work or academia results actually look like. At first they're kind of intimidating and seem full of jargon but that makes it real cool when later on you realize what's actually going on.

- Finally, your academic advisor is a great resource for questions and things, whether it be career planning, graduate school, where to look to find research, tutoring, etc., and it's a good to check in with them, especially when you're just getting started. (I think buzzport tells you who you're academic advisor is.)

Anyway, that's my long rundown. Hope that's all helpful. This is just all stuff I've been learning through my four years of being here, and now that I actually have a handle at how to use these resources I'm throwing all this info at you. Most importantly, keep calm, carry on, have fun, and learn a bunch. :)",positive,0.9996,positive,0.26499286987522286,02/14/2021

I signed up very late for housing (accepted after waitlist) and was randomly assigned with people who were randomly assigned to a 4 person room in GLENN! Although I was grateful and got along with the 3 other guys very well, it was very cramped (whomever get's the room with the door will have triple the traffic), extreme lack of privacy (hope your significant other or hookup has a place of their own unless you magically get 3 people to avoid the room for a period of time), claustrophobic and the mornings will be terrible if yall have different schedules (my room had someone get up at 8am, 9:30am, 11am and 2pm).

It was really fun the first couple of months and then it got annoying and miserable once second semester was about to end.

I highly recommend getting a 2 person next to each other and room with the person you get along the best or has the best schedule (yall can easily room switch in the beginning of the semester officially or unofficially once you get your schedules perfected). I promise you, a 4 person is not exactly a room you should fight to get, unless you manage to only have 1-2 other roommate (totally possible, especially the spring semester).",positive,0.8912,neutral,-0.0489828431372549,02/15/2021

The music you hear from speakers? Still being performed live from the original bands. They've just been shrunk down to fit in those tiny speakers, instruments and all. So many years have passed playing the exact same tunes, they get pretty good at it. Of course, it gets kind of crowded in there, with all the other bands waiting sometimes years to just play their one song...

... In all seriousness, digital videos usually include audio channels, and that's how your device knows what sounds to play along with the video. [This diagram shows an outline of the process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio#/media/File:A-D-A_Flow.svg). [Here is an explanation of how sound is sampled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_concepts) and a [list of common audio codecs and their corresponding video formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs)

And if you are asking how the device knows whether to play the output through its own speakers, headphones, or even wireless speakers, I don't know the specifics. But basically it will send the sound encoded in a digital format to somewhere with a digital-to-analog-converter, where it is converted into analog waveforms that vibrate the physical speaker using magnets.

that's a complaint as it would alter your strategy on the test.

way back in the 90's, we had a calc professor require hand calculations IIRC 6 decimal points- and the calculations took several pages.

when he graded after the fact, he announced the final exam was binary- either correct or not... you could demonstrate you understood the material deeply yet if you were off by .000001 the entire thing was wrong on the final.  i.e. we spent the entire test doing basic addition.

comments,"Real-estate in Atlanta is really expensive near Tech and the supply for land/buildings is low. Not to mention Fulton County and City of Atlanta has some of the highest property/sales taxes in the state. I have family friends who have previously operated restaurant businesses in midtown and they say that the profit margins of operating a food business are very low and there's a lot of risk associated with operating in Midtown, compared to operating right down the road in Dekalb, Cobb, Gwinnett, Douglas, Clayton, ect.. And they operated in the early 2010s so it's probably worse now. Not to mention the dangers of Atlanta past 8pm and lack of friendly parking around midtown can hinder business (like that Ramen place near sq5 has been robbed and damaged a couples of times and parking to go to Cafe Intermezzo resulted in me dealing with booters). They now operate right outside the perimeter and say that life is a lot easier operating out of Fulton. Plus, im not sure how big of a factor this is but restaurants around Tech have to compete with the huge kitchen access on campus. Most non-freshman housing tend to have a kitchen within their rooms and some freshman dorms have solid communal kitchens, something that is actually pretty unusual when compared to other colleges since most on-campus housing in colleges are like traditional shoebox-esque dorms.

Unless youre talking about having chains like McDonalds nearby, the free-market at Tech isnt exactly the easiest to operate in, especially since ~~Sodexo~~ has a monopoly on Tech land so they have their own agenda to meet too. Plus, we got WaHo, Papa Johns, Goodfellas, Taco Bell, Wingzone, Cookout, BP Gas station, Insomnia Cookies and SweetHut open late in the night plus DoorDash/UberEats/GrubHub so it's not like theres a major lack of food.

If youre not a freshman, switching into either is a process.

That being said, Computer Engineering is semi-agreed upon as the most challenging undergrad degree offered at Tech, and Tech is no piece of cake. You will be beat down. You will fail. You will question if you belong here. You do! The most important thing Tech and the ECE department teach us is how to fail.

A startup internship will help very little in recruiting from BigTech. And one startup is very different from another so experiences can't translate easily. I would use GT brand to get a big tech internship while you have the opp. The best on-ramp to big tech is from a good school when they are actively seeking your profile out.

Startup world kinda chooses you, rather than the other way round. It's a collection of personality quirks, a contrarian worldview and a stubborn resolve with creative flair that leads you to pursue a foolish idea. That might pay-off massively. Or not.

Nah, you don't wait for opportunity. You snatch it up, examine it, and decide whether to take it. Some opportunity comes organically but rarely, but this sounds like some if it's meant to be it will be spiritualism garbage. There is a factor of luck in startup success, a lot of which is the determining factor, and sometimes it comes down to whether the market is ready or not. Timing. However, mostly it doesn't come without grind and intention. The chances of you succeeding off an idea that has absolutely no basis in reality are low. Especially one that's even remotely close to being as bullshitty as what I just said in here. I literally looked up some technical terms and threw them all together to make it sound impressive to someone who doesn't know what the fuck they are reading. The fact you read that far over it makes me question your ability see truth in satire, and acknowledge it. Nobody here is demeaning anyone other than those who are full of shit, and they bring that on themselves.

You‚Äôre not completely wrong, but I think the limited number of tickets for club members was a fair exchange considering Reck Club typically has a decent amount of gameday duties. This year, particularly, not even all of Reck Club got tickets (roughly half). There were some kinks to work out with distribution within the club, you probably just caught that, but there were some internal rules about attendance and arrival times to ensure that as many seats as possible could be filled with other students. Football is the only sport that guarantees tickets to Reck Club, and Reck Club isn‚Äôt the only student org that gets tickets (some of the seats in the front row you saw might have been the ones reserved for Goldfellas).

comments,"I noticed you have a kid about to start middle school. What are you expecting your schooling situation to be? City schools are extremely hot or miss, but we do have some decent ones like Inman and Sutton middle schools and North Atlanta and Grady high schools. However, none of the high schools compare to the East Cobb, Alpharetta, etc., high schools. Depending on your lifestyle and how you value those tradeoffs you might consider at least taking a drive around some of those areas or evaluating the drive. 

FWIW, we have a 3-year-old and currently live close to campus. I'm on staff as well, my wife works in Buckhead. We have no intentions on living anywhere far from our jobs. Our daughter would go into E Rivers elementary, Sutton middle, and North Atlanta high schools. We'd have absolutely no qualms sending her along this path, and we're also looking at houses in Brandon elementary area (same middle and high).

I'd also recommend checking out the area where your wife expects to work and how to get in/out of campus as well as what's around it. Tech Square is a great part of campus that is also part of Midtown proper. I'm over on West campus with quick access to Marietta, Northside, and Howell Mill. She might, say, be located on the Hill near North Avenue and may want to check out that area.

Beyond that you've gotten some good advice in this thread already. Music, sadly, is still tough to find (stupid pandemic), but we have some awesome venues. You could check Creative Loafing for concerts closer to when you visit and at least gauge where those venues are.

Atlanta is also an excellent food city (and beer city if that's up your alley). Buford Highway has most of our ethnic cuisines. Ponce City Market is pretty close to campus and worth checking out. You can also spend some time on the Beltline while you're there (could be crowded depending on the weather). Some other specific food recommendations close to campus are Cypress Street Pint &amp; Plate, The Optimist, Fontaine's, Der Biergarden, and Six Feet Under.

For a quick jaunt in Atlanta I highly recommend the Botanical Gardens and Fernbank Museum. If you do the Gardens check out Piedmont Park while you're at it. Fernbank is kind of out of the way, but you can head over to Decatur after. Both are kicking off new exhibits, too!

I feel like that's a decent starting point, though I've certainly missed some stuff. Happy to answer other questions, too!",positive,0.9953,positive,0.1661582956185229,02/20/2021

* Our chapters were around 3 hours each week and always formal.
* Plus you have to study for a quiz every week and plan a mini-activity with your fellow pledges every week to conduct during chapter with the actives (quizzes are standard for sororities, I think, but the activity portion was specific to our sorority).
* We also had a commitment to meet with our big every week for at least an hour, plus like two hours of small group meetings.
* Over the course of the semester, my sorority required that we meet one-on-one with every active at least once, so that would be like 2-3 meetings a week (it was to get to know each other and it was super fun, but time-consuming).
* Every month we'd have at least one larger event (sisterhood event, mixer, dance, big/little bonding event, etc.) and we would sometimes have to help plan or set those up.
* It was also a tradition of ours that the pledges planned an event/party once in their pledge semester.
* Initiation is a weekend-long thing if you make it that far.

comments,"It is definitely doable. Outside of meetings you will be required to attend some events for philanthropy, socials, and other special events. But that is the purpose of joining a sorority and members have to put into the chapter to get something out of it. Everyone needs to participate to make it work. Time management is important but this is Georgia Tech and EVERYONE has to study so the requirements are not unreasonable.

There are tons and tons of chem e and bio chem majors in sororities, and academic success is highly valued in all the houses. As a member, you will benefit immensely from upperclassman sisters' recommendations on different classes, sections, professors, research opportunities, job connections, etc., not to mention you could likely be in class together with some and you can help each other when you are struggling in a class and get help from older sisters!

Sorority meetings are not boring IMO. Besides being required to conduct the chapter business and catch up socially with the rest of your sisters, they are great training for how to run a meeting efficiently, and you can often tell in the work place who was Greek by how well they can control their meetings, stick to the subject/agenda, and speak in front of a group to keep everyone focused and get things accomplished expeditiously.  These meetings are also an interesting study in human behavior and how to get along with different personalities and viewpoints, how to make your point and get people fired up when you're not in the majority, how to gain respect and how to lose it. Great life skills. As a New Member you will also be required to attend your New Member Class meetings, but they are well worth it because they are all about getting to know those specific girls who you will be the closest with and to learn about your sorority in general. New Member meetings are only a thing for the weeks until you get initiated.

Sorority membership offers the social support that helps keep the GT academic stress from consuming you, if you have time management skills and are realistic about your expectations. You have to contribute some effort and talent to your chapter's functions (that's what makes the whole organization work) and you need to make some effort to get to know your sisters and hang out with them to find your friend group. You will not like everyone in your sorority. There will be some you can't stand, some you are just okay with, another group you really feel at home with, and a small handful that you will absolutely love and be closest to. That handful right there makes it worthwhile.

Go through rush and see how you connect. Meet people, ask your questions, see how you feel. The chapters are very similar but each has a different vibe. Go through and decide for yourself.",positive,0.9981,positive,0.16675273139558855,02/21/2021

IR thermometers have like +/-1.5C degree error bars which makes them pretty useless.

I mean everything you said is about vaccines is speculation. Every vaccine we are required to take has many scientific research studies with decades of research post FDA approval. Plus the symptoms of those diseases (especially meningitis, Hep C, TB) are worth taking the risk to take a vaccine. 

The new Covid vaccine is uncharted territory. This is the first vaccine of its type and we have absolutely no idea of its effects long-term, like 0 clue. Plus the symptoms of covid arent scary/urgent to me (young, fit, balanced diet, decent genetics since both grandparents are in their late 80s and live like theyre still 50).  

Im not comfortable taking the vaccine. Im not taking it because scientists or I have no idea what the vaccine will do to the body long term. Id rather have a shorter life due to natural causes than a man-made error.

comments,"I'm transportation in particular, but only third-year and not getting out soon, and I have a vague idea, but I can't say for sure. I think it would have to involve a team of different disciplines, including engineering, finance, econ. There are several similar projects (Dallas, Boston, Pittsburgh to name a few) that can be used as a baseline.

For travel delays, interchange crashes, street crashes, some things I can think of to study: conflict points, intersections, lights, protected/unprotected turns, pedestrian/bike crossings, throughput, delays, on/off times, traffic weaving - this one is important because many (I'd even say most) highway crashes are caused by merging and weaving, especially side crashes. Traffic weaving is when there are cars merging on and cars merging off at the same time.

For the economic side: this is hard. We can measure and loosely predict property value increases and such, but Midtown is in such a way that it's tricky to do. Property values are really high already, and some owners are just waiting for the right price to sell or buy.

Intangibles: Even harder. What price do you place on greenspace? Trees? A human life? Quality of life? Economists can price all of these things, but they're hard to measure.

Also, big projects like these take dozens of feasibility studies to even begin. I'd expect to see a lot more info before construction ever starts, and at least a decade more time, imo.",positive,0.6081,positive,0.07230090896757561,02/22/2021

comments,"A lot of the people who work on campus are work study (the US government pays their salary to help them pay for college), so try to go easy on this person. Their bosses and the government explicitly state that they should be able to study on the job, so they feel entitled to do their homework while they're working. They're often poor, and they're under a lot of stress to do well, so they don't like answering the phone during their work especially when there are systems in place to keep them from having to answer the phone. If they weren't work study, they were just being pointlessly mean, and you have every right to be angry.

However, none of that changes the fact that you deserve to be treated well by the people you pay to help you, and anyone who works at a research institute like Georgia Tech should be aware that they're going to be working with International students whose English is still being improved.

&gt;The vaccine has the same ingredients as any other vaccine and it does not have live virus in it.

That's an extremely vague statement. The Covid vaccine is the first ever mRNA vaccine in the US and the first ever Adenovirus vaccine in Europe. Im only comfortable with taking vaccines that are live-attenuated, inactivated, toxoid or recombinant proteins. Not only that, I also do not want to take an mRNA or Adenovirus vaccine because it's uncharted territory (plus no FDA approval) and there are no legal protections for me if I do experience an adverse effect in the long-run. If Moderna and Pfizer are so extremely confident with their vaccine, why are they revoking the ability for people to sue them for damages?

&gt;I'm not a doctor, but I don't see any mechanism in the vaccine that could result in long term effects.

What an oxymoron. Dont ostracize me or anyone else for being concerned about their own well-being and refusing to be a guinea pig. Im not anti-science, anti-covid, or anti-mask. But I am definitely anti-big Pharma so Im more hesitant to take medications made by these huge pharma corporations, especially when their product lacks FDA approval, long term studies or legal consumer protections.

Personally, I do not trust big-Pharma, especially when there's a lack FDA approval, no ability to sue in case of damages, and an absence of long-term studies on mRNA and Adenovirus vaccines.. Not everyone wants to be a guinea pig for this experiment. Plus Big-Pharma is notorious for being involved in medical malpractice and mishaps throughout history at the expense of gaining profit (Pfizer and Moderna are projected to profit $32 Billion off the vaccines so someone is getting mega rich off of this) so I dont find people who hesitate to get it 'dumb as a brick'

Secondarily, it makes a lot more sense to make the COVID vaccine required in populations that are more likely to be susceptible to more severe symptoms, like nursing home patients and staff. In a college setting, a student is probably more likely to die from the flu than COVID. The only reason you could feasibly justify making a COVID vaccine mandatory is because of its higher R0 value.

Short answer: It doesn‚Äôt take up too much time. And highly recommend (at least rushing or trying COB) 

Long answer: In addition to a sorority I‚Äôm in 2 other clubs as well as a ‚Äúhard major‚Äù (ME) Although let‚Äôs be honest, most everything at Tech is hard in its own way. I still feel as if I have time to do all my work, and it‚Äôs really just a time management thing. Go to fun things when you have time, don‚Äôt go when you have to study. In my experience people understand prioritizing academics (we are at Tech). I pretty much consistently go to meal plan and chapter. The date nights/sisterhood events are more of a does it work in my schedule. Only mandatory thing for me is chapter (which you can still get a few excuses from per semester if you are really having a rough week) and then service hours which is pretty easy to complete and honestly fun. It doesn‚Äôt feel like a chore because you WANT to go and hang out with people and sometimes take a break from the craziness of school. If you don‚Äôt think you should do it first semester though so that you get your bearing first, it‚Äôs totally common for 2nd years and even 3rd years to rush (as well as a lot of girls do COB). So if you are worried about class load with it maybe delay for a semester or so until you get your feet under you.",positive,0.9764,positive,0.13273437500000002,02/23/2021

comments,"That's mostly true of HEERF II, but it actually wasn't the case for HEERF I. Under the CARES Act, the only mandated restriction was that the student be an eligible Title IV student under Section 484 of the HEA (basically all of us). The specifics were left up to the discretion of the universities. [PDF source, see Q9](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/heerf18004a1cfaq-crrsaadisc.pdf)

However, Congress changed that for HEERF II. Unlike last time, the CRRSAA requires that universities now prioritize students with exceptional need, and they must document how they make those determinations to report to the Department of Education. Tech has defined that as having an EFC less than 1/2 of cost of attendance. The rest (e.g. per-student amounts) are still at discretion, but you're correct that Tech can't just give it to anyone this time.

comments,"Current SPS here! I'm happy to answer any specific questions, but I would honestly say, just be yourself. Recognize there is a high amount of luck involved at this point, and (though this may be less of a problem as you're less in contact with your other finalists) DON'T let yourself get psyched out by someone else's accomplishments. Especially at this point, you all made the ""academic cut-off"" so they are really looking at service, your PLANS for the future, and that youre a grounded *person.* As always, it doesn't hurt to look over your accomplishments to prep for ""time when"" questions, and it is also a good idea to have something in mind for why you like tech/what you may have learned from scholars week. Or even questions for your interviewers! I can also say that my interviewers were an alumnus and two professors/faculty, if that helps.

For the group interview (which I thought was the weirdest one) they may change it this year, but its almost always some kind of challenge, because they want to see how you balance leadership and working with others and how you approach a problem.

Last thing, please, please let your genuine enthusiasm for the program shine through...if you want to be here, that says a lot! :) And (just in general) tip: use your host/the Canvas page! I don't know who you are/what your major is/who your host is, but most of us have been dying to meet finalists and really can't wait to interact.

comments,"There's absolutely still hope for you to bring your GPA up. How you do in first year weed outs like calc is not indicative of your future performance in major classes. Calc is especially notorious for being very hard here. People with good GPAs like to talk about them, but trust me, there are *plenty* of people whose GPAs are a bit lower.

It sounds like you're already doing a lot right (attending lecture, doing practice exams, etc), and you should keep doing those things! Another thing to add would be attending office hours to talk to your professors about why you may be having trouble and to work with them individually to improve. I'd also recommend looking into the various tutoring services offered. They offer both one-on-one tutoring as well as PLUS group sessions (certain classes), all available to you for free. There's no shame in utilizing these services or anything like that. These are offered exactly because many classes are hard for a lot of students.

My top studying advice is to study smart, not (necessarily) hard. Drilling through material to an extreme degree with no concrete goals will not be nearly as effective as assessing where you're having trouble specifically and then working on those areas. If the textbook isn't making enough sense in one section, look up some good online resources, such as YouTube videos. Go to office hours and work through those troublesome topics and examples with the professor.

To answer your ultimate question of whether it gets better in upper level classes, I'd say it does. While the content may be more intellectually challenging, the work and tests are usually significantly lighter. Most profs at that level are out to just make sure you're getting it, not try to make you almost fail. Furthermore, by that point you're going to be a lot more experienced and have a better picture of what does and doesn't work for you. I know plenty of people who struggled a bit their first year but went on to do some really cool things and graduated in a pretty good academic position.",positive,0.9889,positive,0.2260957792207792,02/24/2021

The Tech degree and what you have learned getting it will last.  The GPA will be forgotten.

For the first job, I won't deny that a good GPA helps, but once you have that first job it becomes way more about experience and what you can offer the company you are interviewing with than your GPA.   I can count on one hand the number of resumes that actually even list the GPA for the various positions  I've interviewed people for in the last 25 years or so.",positive,0.9343,positive,0.26666666666666666,02/24/2021

comments,"I think there‚Äôs a lot to this. It may not that they get easier but more reasonable or students start to ‚Äúhit their stride‚Äù with a way of studying that really works. As others have mentioned, there are outside resources and there‚Äôs no shame in using them. Maybe the source of your current issues is not lack of effort but rather lack of effectiveness. From what it sounds like you are very hardworking but aren‚Äôt seeing the results you like. If you had sometime, I‚Äôd suggest using the academic coaching service we have here to possibly fix this disconnect between what you want and how much time you put in. Even though it‚Äôs only my 2nd year here, I‚Äôve felt the sentiment especially with physics 2211. But looking back at the situation, these classes are very formulaic in nature which could mean a multitude of things such as there only being limited ways to solve a problem and limited ways to succeed in a class. My suggestion is to take a look back at everything, see where these mistakes are coming from, are they big large conceptual mistakes that cause these issues or are they minute lapses in the concept that add up to cause a large disparity between grades and effort.",negative,-0.3536,positive,0.05535714285714284,02/24/2021

personally I don't have a well-formed opinion on if it should be changed, but I am a big fan of the unofficial ""to raise the ratio""

EDIT: upon further thought, it really should be changed in the official, current version. I guess I'm just so tired of arguing with men that I felt reluctant to anger people over a seemingly small change. No, it doesn't actively offend me when I hear it, but the historical context doesn't lie and the lyric is still representative of Tech not being meant for female students. People will still sing what they want, and the old version shouldn't be erased from the records. It serves as a reminder of Tech's male-dominated past (and present). Female students are well aware that this institution wasn't designed for them, and there are still many remnants of that today as it evolves towards being a more inclusive place. But part of that evolution is making seemingly small changes that symbolize larger things.",negative,-0.9172,neutral,-0.008333333333333325,02/24/2021

Those who bring this up are offended at the idea that someone could possibly be offended, and validating those people by playing along is a threat to all things rational, truthful, and wholly progressive.

Changing cheer to join changes the fundamental meaning - and doesn't even solve your supposed issue between differentiating between the men and women on campus. If I wanted to play your game, one could easily argue that the proposed phrasing change further perpetuates the divisively of gender roles on campus in that women must ""join"" the men, suggesting that they aren't already part of the ""Bold"".

I get that that 1A+ was giving off the perception of being clunky, but I think people are better off having some idea of what the timeline looks like. At least under phases, people could see where they and their loved ones might end up falling on the list. If we're doing away with that, it ought to be replaced by some kind of queue-like list to show which groups are closer to becoming eligible.

They very well may be planning on doing something like that, in which case I'd like to see that rolled out. However, if it's just going to be ad hoc additions to the eligible population based on current pressures and behind-the-scenes planning, that feels like a worse system than what we had before. Movement is good, but reduced transparency is bad. Without that kind of transparency, the system runs the risk of being perceived as arbitrary and more frustrating than before imo.

comments,"We are actively meeting, discussing and adjusting our local plans based on the latest from the state.  My interpretation was that the phase name elimination was to reduce confusion since they have altered the original plan several times now.  So, rather than refer to this as Phase 1A++, they just dropped the phase names and will now announce who is currently eligible.  Again, that is just my interpretation.  Since the start of our vaccination planning, we have tried to communicate with you all on this platform openly and candidly and hope to continue that dialogue.  

It's important to remember that this has and will remain a state-led operation.  Our role is to put Georgia Tech and our community is the best position to get vaccinated when eligible.  As such, you can expect our plans will need adjusting and modifying as the situation changes or the guidance from the state changes.  Vaccinating our population is *the most important* step we can take in completing our recovery and returning to ""normal.""  This is our focus every day until we're back to normal.  As always, we appreciate everyone's patience as we go through this.  

The good news is that we're growing the eligible population.  That means more shots in arms and steps closer to normal across the state.  Additionally, we continue to see supply grow across the country and in the state.  So, we have some hope that we'll see an increase in tempo on announcing further expansions.

Expect further communication from the Institute over the coming days on this topic specifically.

I just want to make sure they continue to communicate who they're considering adding next before they become actively eligible so that people can have some idea of where they more-or-less stand in line ahead of time.

For what it's worth, I really appreciate your active participation on this sub when folks like me have questions!

comments,"Absolutely, but it sort of seems like they're no longer communicating the phases *at all* to the currently ineligible public. Prior to today, the [state website](https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-vaccine) had a graphic with columns showing groups currently eligible, groups planned to be in the next phase, and groups potentially in the one after that. Now, it just shows a single bullet-point list of the currently eligible group and *nothing* else.

So, where are the phases now? Getting rid of the arbitrary labels ""1A+, 1B, etc."" is probably good, but it seems like they've thrown out the columns/phases with them altogether. There's the plan document, but I doubt most people are going to read through a 56-page PDF just to find that. Furthermore, the phases portion of that document currently has no definitions for any phases beyond the current one, which seems just as outdated and vague.

Maybe I'm just cynical because I dislike and don't trust Brian Kemp, but I genuinely can't find anywhere official listing planned potential phases at all, or even potential priorities beyond the currently eligible population.

I'm hoping the Tech-specific communications mentioned above will help provide some clarity for us on this, but it still seems like the state is taking a step backward here.",positive,0.5071,neutral,0.005590062111801242,02/25/2021

comments,"[Mod here of a mid sized subreddit.](https://imgur.com/GFj9DFj) Alt account of course. You can probably determine which mod account I have on that subreddit from the following images but eh.

1. [Every morning we wake up, log in, and look at the queue count.](https://i.imgur.com/63ZRwlI.png) First number is personal DM responses, second is the mod mail, third is the mod queue, and ignore the fourth. Looks painful but it's not that bad. Just very tiresome to grind through.

2. [The queue today looks like some spam, some salt, some shadowbanned individuals, and some misflaired posts.](https://i.imgur.com/hkDR49s.png) All ingredients to a healthy and balanced breakfast. Nothing ban worthy. Just some approvals and removals. Bans are rare but are up to the moderator's discretion. Perma ban some random guy for no reason? Sure. Just dont do it too often or you'll have redditors complaining.

1. [There are thankfully tools that automate the removal process.](https://i.imgur.com/8AwcHz7.png) Go down the list, check off which ones the post is violating, then click remove at the very bottom.

3. [On the other hand, we have the mod mail.](https://i.imgur.com/DiiWPco.png) We have an automatic removal system when reports reach a certain number threshold. Behind the scenes, it's surprising how democratic mid sized subreddit moderation is.

 Your reports have a direct effect on what appears on the front page. Any appeals goes to the mod mail for manual review. 

 It's really appreciated if the the removed comment/post link is in the message body as it appears like a basic text block with no referance to what the redditor is mentioning. Increases the chance of the moderator saying fuck the rules and approve anyways.

1. [Clearing the mail is a little harder as every message must be manually typed out.](https://i.imgur.com/AIueQGl.png) It's fairly repetative so copy pasting the same message over and over usually works.

4. [Ban appeals also appear in the mod mail and requires a more in depth review.](https://i.imgur.com/4oeftgY.png) Depending on the severity, it may require a short mod vote over a private discord or just whatever the moderator who gets to it first thinks. 
 
 There's no constitution or official power distribution, just what we all think is right. Honestly, none of us care what the other moderators do so long as it's quiet and isolated. 
 
 So the true unwritten rule of moderation is dont fuck up so badly as to require someone else to clean up. Don't go on power trips and burn the subreddit down because dealing with all the mod mail is really annoying. Always back other moderators up in their action in public even if you disapprove and simply ask them in private to explain themselves if it really needs that.

6. [It's the daily grind.](https://i.imgur.com/J3YGBJf.png) Moderators usually wake up, clear the queue, then let it build up for the next mod to wake up and do the same. For months and years on end.

 I'll bet more than half the mods on a subreddit of decent size are completely inactive. Sure, the rush of getting mod powers are great at first but if you're not a dick and just do the job, it's realllllly boring. Luckily there's other active moderators so I dont have to wake up looking at a queue that takes an hour long to go through. Just 20 minutes.

We go through mods every few years due to burnout and occasionally some of them drop off the internet without a trace one day. We leave them on the list of mods because de-modding someone is a really big step and none of us want to do so.

We just got to hope that the head mod (guy at the top of the list) or someone high up doesnt get hacked and de-mods the rest of us. Happened once to a group of subreddits and made a bit of a stir.

On that note, there are subreddits completely without mods and turn out decent. /r/Manga is one. None of the mods there are active (in the subreddit) it's fully democratic with Automod removing posts based on report count and the front page filtered by upvotes. It's the libertarian paradise that /r/Libertarian wish it was.

Theoredically someone can trial and error the system to see what's the report threshold then become a purely removal mod by using alts to spam every post with reports but despite the million plus subscribers, surprisingly it hasnt happened.",positive,0.9889,positive,0.05461710570753126,02/25/2021

Something you can also do is sit and imagine your worst case scenario. ‚ÄúWhat if I fail all my classes?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I can‚Äôt find a job?‚Äù What if I have to transfer?‚Äù Sit and feel how that would be.

comments,"Please take this for what its worth, but I find that the micro-routines throughout my day really help in keeping anxiety at bay. It took me a few years to get into a good routine and these are things I still do as much as possible because I know that if I stop, I will begin to feel very not well.

1) Hydration; drinking lots of water throughout the day but avoid sugary beverages.

2) Going on walks throughout the day. I've been working on research from home for almost a full year now, so I make sure to log between 4-5 miles every day... It's great to get moving, get some fresh air, get away from the computer screen, etc. Also, regular strength training exercise is key. A 15 minute walk a few times a day will do wonders.

3) Sleep is obviously important, not only the amount of daily hours but making sure you wake up every day at the same time (what ever time you decide that is). Try to eat a fat and protein heavy breakfast in the morning.

4) Keep contact with people and stay social. I feel that isolation only makes things worse, especially since everyone is expected to work/study from home effectively. If that means a zoom call with a friend or a socially-distanced hangout session on campus, arrange for it.

5) Limit drugs/alcohol. These things obvious mess with the other micro-routines listed above. I'm not saying don't enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, I'm just saying that most people know when they've had too much when they feel like death the day after.

6) Refine your diet and remove the crap sugar/carbs. These only irritate inflammation and make you feel worse over time.  I've heard stories how poor food choices affect the gut microbiome which in turn creates some type of cells for the brains (not sure if its neurons...?) which then make you crave the same bad foods, so its a snowball effect that is hard to break.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I'm obviously not saying these are cures for mental illness and also not saying that these are ""secrets"" that no one knows about. For me personally, it took years of living by myself at Georgia Tech and lots of ""trial and error"" to get into a really good routine, and behind it were these tasks that I made sure to follow.

comments,"For a long time, nobody would actually verify that you were a caregiver. The definition provided by the state was weak/vague, and most vaccine providers were understandably more concerned with getting shots into arms than asking for paperwork. As a result, you could essentially sign up for an appointment checking the box that you were a caregiver, and nobody would actually ask for proof.

Since receiving some blowback, the state has added relatively stricter requirements. However, many places are still somewhat lax, and in most cases, you only need to show that you share an address with someone over 65, regardless of whether you actually care for them. This has both caused some people to continue to abuse it, while arguably making things harder for those who actually care for relatives (who just don't have the same address).",positive,0.34,positive,0.13214285714285715,02/26/2021

comments,"It all depends on the style of tattoo you want. A good tattoo parlor might be fantastic for one type of style but terrible for another type. Don't search for tattoo shops, search for artists that tattoo the style that you want. Then go to wherever that artist works.

comments,Getting the right professors is absolutely critical for top shelf grades.  I graduated EE above 3.8 but i spent hours and hours each semester choosing professors and i definitely prioritized courses i thought i could get a good grade in over ones i was legitimately interested in in some cases.  I also completely disregarded having a social life.  I do not look back upon tech fondly as a result.  I certainly dont regret busting my butt for good grades but stressing a bit less and enjoying things more and finishing with a 2.5 or 3.0 might very well have been a better play.,positive,0.9857,positive,0.23425925925925928,02/28/2021
