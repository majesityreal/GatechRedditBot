I've browsed this sub for tips on housing and understood to never go for student housing like mark or hub. But I don't wanna go to homepark/atlantic station either rn, maybe a year later. So, this leaves me with places that let out the whole apartment in west and midtown. I'm looking for 2b2b accommodating 4 people with rent+utils maxing out at 750 per person. I need your reviews on my shortlist (old reviews are too old)

1. The brady - I really like this place, also like west midtown cos it's the perfect balance b/w noise and isolation. Rent is also under budget but the recent reviews have been really poor. latest google reviews are filled with 1 star saying it's not the place it used to be before.
2. Marq on Ponce - one more I really like, accessible cos in midtown. recent reviews are good too, although bloated with leasing agent reviews more than about the place itself. But it's a bit far away from my dept, 26 mins on maps.
3. local on 14th - idk why it is kinda expensive, esp more than 1 and 2. also heard someone was killed in their garage sometime ago. But a lot of people recommended local, idk what do you say?!
4. farrington (?) - is tooo far and there's no direct bus route either, but reviews are the best out of 4. worth the commute?

I've looked at other places like mstreet (very last option) and 935m, biltmore, bower (no units available for august move in) . If you got any other suggestions, please do lmk. Thanks!",positive,0.9703,positive,0.1943548387096774,05/31/2023

comments,"Congrats on receiving a pathway offer! It is a really great opportunity.

1. I did my first year at KSU and had a pretty easy time meeting requirements. Just make sure you look at the transfer requirements by major chart to know which ones you need. It is also helpful to look at the equivalency table because some courses offered at your first year institute don’t offer the credit for the GT course. I originally couldn’t get into a chem lab at KSU that I needed for my major requirement. I called GT and talked to an advisor that told me I could switch my major if I just took physics instead of chem to switch to a physics major from biochem, which I successfully did.

2. I think you should definitely pursue your transfer  pathway. If you’re doing study abroad your first semester then your transcript should be fine by spring semester. GT also honors any and every credit that is on your UNC transcript.

3. I’m actually not sure about this one as I was a fall admit and not summer. It would make sense though since summer has a lot of courses offered through the SOUP.",positive,0.9932,positive,0.2671875,06/01/2023

comments,"So, you are absolutely right that women face much more harassment, and I appreciate you calling out that potential bias.

I'm transgender, and people usually perceive me as female. I don't think I receive the same amount of harassment as conventionally attractive cis women, but I've experienced most of the gamut (up to a neighbor insisting on walking with me from marta to where I lived, all while asking extremely sexually explicit questions; only reason I ""went along"" with it was so he would be seen with me on CCTV footage should I disappear; in retrospect not the smartest play, but no lasting harm came of it).

I've not personally found public transit to be worse than existing in the rest of public spaces. In many ways I feel safer because I have a wider field of view due to the train/bus windows reflecting the interior, people only enter/exit periodically, and it's small/linear enough that I can easily tell when someone is watching or following me.

I didn't bring up this aspect in my analysis because women already know what it's like to exist. It certainly sucks, but the biggest concern is that harassment will turn into something worse. The crime stats lead me to believe that it doesn't; there isn't a breakdown by gender, but even if all the victims are women, the rates are pretty darn low.

In my experience and understanding, the vast majority of people (at least in the US) who say things like ""public transit is scary because crime"" are racist to some degree.

You’re right that the main fear of harassment is usually it escalating, but a lot of times the fact that they happen can be traumatizing already, even if nothing comes of it. I know for a fact that my girlfriend’s multiple encounters have made it much more difficult for her to take public transport, and to boil this down to just a “fear” thing really wouldn’t be fair.

And I totally see your point about the race thing, and I honestly feel conflicted. On the one hand, the biggest argument I’ve seen against public transit in America is that it’s “dirty and unsafe”, and I totally agree there are racial connotations (and it frustrates me as well! Give us more transit!). On the other hand, it’s true that public transit in America is much less safe compared to other developed countries. And, referencing my girlfriend’s experience again, experiences like those make “safety is the reason I don’t take public transit” pretty valid, and security very much a problem that needs to be addressed in most American cities. If anything, I don’t think equating anyone that says “public transit is unsafe” to racists is super helpful to the conversation.

I agree, as harassment can definitely be traumatic. There's a big difference between trying to reassure the general public that it's no worse than general existence (which has been the aim of my posts in this thread) and telling someone that the trauma they experienced is all in their head (which I'm not trying to do).

I'm arguing that the general case is not bad (or at least no worse than walking down the street).

Do people have bad experiences? Absolutely. 

Can we reduce those rates? Maybe, yeah, but with what funds? 

When issues are cultural (ex: misogyny), transit agencies can't really address the root causes, so they have limited options. Harassment still [happens in workplaces](https://www.eeoc.gov/data/sexual-harassment-our-nations-workplaces), with GA in the #3 spot for highest per-capita workplace harassment rates.",negative,-0.9521,positive,0.08587301587301586,06/02/2023

> Title: Operation: ""T"" in Tech Tower
> 
> In the heart of Atlanta, the Georgia Institute of Technology, or as it was lovingly known, Georgia Tech, stood in all its grandeur. For centuries, it had churned out some of the brightest minds in the country, and had become a legend not only for its academic prowess but for a rich tapestry of traditions, pranks, and legendary characters. Among these legends, one name echoed with an uncanny mystique - George P Burdell, the student who never was, and yet was everywhere.
> 
> And then, there was Georgie Tech, the newest sensation of the Georgia Tech campus, a mechanical engineering sophomore with an uncanny knack for making things happen. Georgie wasn't just a Tech student; she was the Tech spirit embodied in human form.
> 
> But, of all the numerous buildings, one held a special place in the hearts of every Georgia Tech student - the iconic Tech Tower, with the gleaming letter ""T"" perched on its pinnacle. The temptation to pilfer that ""T"" had led many brave, or foolish, souls into the night, yet it had always proved elusive. A symbol of challenge, a trophy of honor. Georgie and Burdell were not immune to its allure.
> 
> Our story begins on a balmy summer night, the moon casting long shadows that crept around the red brick buildings. Underneath the sprawling magnolia trees, our dynamic duo - the unlikely alliance of Georgie Tech, the vivacious realist, and George P Burdell, the elusive idealist - hatched their audacious plan.
> 
> ""George,"" Georgie started, her hazel eyes twinkling in the moonlight, ""I've done the math. I've studied the blueprints. We can do this.""
> 
> Burdell, whose presence could only be inferred from the rustling of leaves and the occasional hushed whisper, replied, ""Georgie, my dear, we're not just 'doing this'. We're going to etch our names into Tech's annals of history.""
> 
> As they plotted beneath the starlit canopy, the Tech Tower loomed over them, the shining ""T"" high above, winking at them as if in a challenge.
> 
> Thus began Operation: ""T"" in Tech Tower - an escapade that promised laughs, thrill, camaraderie, and a dash of Georgia Tech spirit, one that would, if successful, leave a legendary imprint in the chronicles of the institution they both loved and represented.

I went in the exit that’s right next door and asked if they could just verify the code and skip the gimmick since it clearly wasn’t working and he shewed me back out since that was the members only door. Said he didn’t know the code to check it (which seemed unlikely - the hotel concierge recited it to me from memory). It wasn’t too busy, he just had to do it through the phone booth, so we went in and tried again. And instead of just opening the door and letting us in (we noted we we’re staying next door, showed him the number we were given), he made us try calling it again. After another two minutes standing in the phone booth (with the people behind us getting agitated at US like it was our fault even though we followed the rules and got the code from our hotel literally right next door), we gave up and walked away. 

I’ve never been so infuriated in my life. People leaving as we got there said the bartender was flustered from the private party and screwed up their drinks. 

Maybe it was just an off night for them but it completely ruined our entire night. We came back three different times trying to get in and they clearly had no clue what was going on.

comments,"Errr I can give you my suggestions, I was on campus my junior year and off campus commuting OTP my senior year. 

I was on campus my junior year and in that year I was able to gain a stable friendship group and in retrospect improve my life overall. One of my roommate taught me how to look for internships and the friendly banter with my roommate definitely made it the most worthwhile year. 

&#x200B;

In senior year I moved home because I simply wanted to spend time on myself and my academic career + hangout with my older parents. This year was hard and not at the same time, I lost some bonding time with friends but in return for that I gained a appreciation of my classes and the time I spent with my family was valuable as ever.

&#x200B;

A 30-40 min drive in traffic sounds completely fine, that was what I did from kanasaw everyday. But keep in mind these on and off hour kind of stacks up so make sure to do your hw in between. On the other hand if this was your first time transferring to tech I would highly suggest living close to or on campus. This would improve your social life to a certain extent. I know home park housing is around $900 - $1100 so roughly do budgeting however you can. Good Luck!",positive,0.9934,positive,0.18583850931677018,06/05/2023
comments,"tl;dr: if you want to get the most out of your Tech experience, I'd encourage living within walking/biking distance of campus.

I tried living at my folks' ATP home sophomore year and ended up moving to Home Park midway through. We weren't even as far away as you; 3 minutes to spaghetti junction and maybe 20 to my Tech parking deck without traffic.

The three things that killed my commuter experience:

* Lack of participation in unscheduled social activities. So much of the college experience is the impromptu group study session, late night playing \[board/card/video\] games, or just getting a burger and beer with friends. Once I was back home after classes, I never felt like driving all the way back to campus (often at rush hour) just to hang out for an hour or two. Weekends were often a total loss.
* Spending countless hours just waiting around for the next class/lab/activity. Maybe you'll have good luck with scheduling but sometimes you're stuck with a 9am class, a 3pm class, and then a 6pm study session. Driving back and forth felt like a waste of time so I'd just sit around the CoC or library. I rationalized it by saying ""I'll study and do homework!"" but it's so draining to do this multiple times per week.
* Just sitting in traffic for an hour or more per day. Sure, the drive was 20 minutes without traffic-- but even back in 2004 Atlanta traffic was terrible and the commute would often be 45+ minutes. MARTA would have taken even longer between driving to Doraville or Chamblee station, parking, waiting on the train (MARTA service isn't frequent), getting to 10th St or North Ave, and then walking to class.

This is to say nothing of some common extracurricular activities after which you might not want to drive or might benefit from a room to yourself near campus.

I totally get trying to save money. I tried it myself. But moving back near campus was worth the expense for me.

ETA: I was in a similar financial situation where I was on HOPE and my folks weren't paying for housing. So when I say ""worth the expense"", it was a direct financial consideration on my part.",positive,0.9025,neutral,0.0478494623655914,06/05/2023

I understand being a broke college student, but the time and \*stress\* of commuting could be spent closer to campus addressing that shortfall.   You're looking at at least an hour each way, which does not take into account 

1 - Finding a parking spot (and paying for it)

2 - Walking to class from said parking spot

3 - Logistics of preparing for your trip twice a day (do I have my books, assignments, laptop, charger, etc.)

&#x200B;

I was lucky enough to stay on campus my entire stay (this was in the late 90's back before there were shortages in housing), but if I had to choose between a free room 30 miles away (in McDonough, no less) or arranging a roommate/rental situation closer in then I'd choose a close rental.     

The logistical and psychological stress of having to transport yourself to class/lab is way more manageable.   An accident or traffic light is much less prone to making you miss half a lecture.   You can go about your day randomly as things occur... eat when you feel like it, come and go as suits you.       This isn't possible as a commuter.

i’d absolutely say to find somewhere in atlanta to live. first of all, mcdonough and henry county in general are growing way faster than the infrastructure can handle, so the traffic and commute are just gonna get worse and worse. especially if you live near the square, 155, or 81, don’t expect google maps to be accurate. i’m currently doing an internship in mcdonough, and the gpa says it only takes 15 minutes to get home, but in reality it’s 30 minutes. personally, i live on campus and don’t bring my car. atlanta definitely isn’t the most walkable city, but i prefer biking and using marta over driving around. secondly, as others have said, living near campus will let you be a lot more connected with student life. this was very important for me because making new friends has always been really hard for me, so living on campus pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me meet new people. i truly don’t believe i’d have the friend group i do if i was commuting. lastly, i’ve been in mcdonough pretty much my entire life and i really wanted to experience something new. idk how long you’ve been here but mcdonough gets really old and boring after a few years lol.

when i was in high school, i commuted every day to morrow to do dual enrollment at clayton state university. if i’m honest, i was completely miserable during those two years. i live on the rural side of mcdonough so this was a 40 minute drive for me. then, i had to drive to my high school for classes there which was another 30 minutes. doing this every single day very quickly wears down your body. i had constant back pain and was always too tired to do anything when i got home. i felt socially disconnected from csu and my high school even though i went to both every day. it’s very difficult to find a community when you’re not always interacting with said community. i’m in a similar economic situation to you where my parents make too much money for financial aid but not enough to be able to pay for my college comfortably. they wanted me to commute to gt and thought it would be easy since my brother commuted to gsu. however, i knew my mental health would completely deteriorate if i commuted. i told them i couldn’t do it but they didn’t really listen to me until i shared how i truly felt during my commutes to csu. obviously everyone’s economic situation is different but we found a way to make it work. you can always find a job or internship to help your parents pay off your housing. georgia tech is really hard and will eat you alive if your mind isn’t in the right place. you always hear stories about really smart students who never struggled in high school and then failed all their classes in their first semester at gt. it’s really hard to take advantage of all the academic resources this school give you if you aren’t always on campus. 

if you haven’t already, have a serious conversation with you parents about money and tell them why living on campus is important to you. if you maintain zell, housing and food would be your only big cost, and with a gt salary, i think you could easily pay those loans off. but again, everyone’s situation is different. if you do end up having to commute, i think marta would be the way to go. you won’t have to pay for parking on campus and i believe you can get a student discount on your fares. i’d also go to lakewood fort mcpherson instead of college park bc it’s a shorter drive to the station and you’ll spend less time on the train.

ik this comment was really long and i went on a lot of tangents but hopefully you got the gist of what i’m trying to say. feel free to ask me any questions. whatever you decide, good luck and welcome to tech!",positive,0.9961,positive,0.0744738849911264,06/05/2023
comments,"The train only runs every 20 minutes? What? There are two lines from College Park, both of which run every 10 minutes during the day staggered, and since Tech is before the split that's a train every 5 minutes. It's only a 20 minute gap in the middle of the night, and even then only if one of the lines is under maintenance.

That was my commute before I graduated, and I would strongly recommend, it's great- I got *so* much of my reading done on the train, and it's cheap (an unlimited monthly pass from Tech is less expensive than a campus parking pass alone, nevermind gas and maintenance), much safer than ATL traffic, and pretty stress-free. MARTA buses are a frustrating pain, but the trains are great and very reliable.",positive,0.8823,positive,0.14777777777777779,06/05/2023

comments,"Hey! Thanks so much for your reply! I've lived in McDonough a good chunk of my entire life, and definitely need a change of scenery! It looks like everyone on here is in agreement with you that housing on-campus is a must of next year! McDonough has definitely grown old, and I think it's time for me to stretch my legs a bit. 

I also just transferred in from Clayton State too - so it's good to know that there's already some people who went through similar situations as me here! (Also, If you've got any tips on how you managed your transition - I'd love to hear them! I've got a couple buddies coming over for fall from CSU, and I think we're all a little concerned about the switch!) I was a commuter last year too - and it sucked pretty bad. I ended up getting an on campus job just to fill in some gaps in my time, but looking back that caused me even more stress than it was supposed to. Commuting is hell, and I can see now that it's probably worth the loans to avoid the stress. My parent's house is right off Jonesboro road, so it would only be a 5 minute drive to get on I-75 northbound - but an hour and twenty minutes each way is insane. I'm not even sure how to even realistically begin to plan for that.

My goal for Fall is to ease into Tech, with only taking 12-13 credits and trying to focus on managing the transition above than anything else (i.e. part time job, research opportunities, etc). I think at this point commuting is a last resort - I don't think I realized how many opportunities I would miss out on now that I'm at a bigger school with more resources! I've talked to my parents about it before too - and they were just like yours in the sense that they felt it wasn't necessary and shouldn't have to help. I'm hoping that showing them some of the comments on here will help sway their minds a bit. Even so, I might be able to balance a summer coop/internship to pay off some of that debt while it's still accruing.

Also, the MARTA Tip is greatly appreciated! I've only ever taken the East Point and College park stations since they're the closest, so I'll need to take lakewood-fort mcpherson next time! I'm still on the fence about whether or not to bring my car, $800 a year is a lot for a parking pass - but at the same time that's a lot more freedom to bring on campus. 

Thank you again for your help and advice - I really appreciate it! Your comment gave me hope that there are others out there who went through similar experiences that I am going through now - and I'm really appreciative/thankful of that! Go Jackets! 😁",positive,0.9636,positive,0.14246945488721804,06/05/2023

comments,"i think the biggest difference between classes at csu and gt (other than them being harder) is the class size. my physics 1 class at csu only had about 25 people in it while my my physics 2 class at gt had about 200 people in it. at csu it’s a lot easier to build a relationship with your professors and get help from them because they have less students to look after. there’s a lot more resources to get academic help at gt bc the professors are much busier. there’s scheduled and drop in tutoring, plus sessions, recitations, office hours, etc. you just have to find what works for you. it’s also really helpful to use a calendar or agenda to keep track of not only your schoolwork but anything else you want to get done throughout the day. but the most important part is to do the stuff that you like to do. i think it’s really smart that you’re only take 12ish credits during your first semester bc it gives you more time to figure out how you wanna navigate this school. it’ll let you see if you’re able to take more credits or if you want to add more extracurriculars. in addition to class, i’d find one club that you find interesting and commit to it for a while. it doesn’t have to be the whole semester if you don’t like it, but clubs are a great way to meet new people and do something that isn’t school. if you only do schoolwork, you’ll burnout really quickly. 

as for your car, unless you plan on leaving the city a lot, i don’t think it’s worth it at all. csu’s campus is built in a way where you can always move your car near the building you have class at which makes the parking pass convenient. at gt, you have an assigned parking garage so you’ll always be parking in the same spot. also campus is designed around walking so driving is much more difficult than walking. if you’re worried about the time that it will take to get from your apartment to campus, you can get a bike or scooter. every building on campus has bike racks so you won’t have to worry about where you can leave it.",positive,0.9868,positive,0.215252276459173,06/05/2023

comments,"Thank you so much! Some of the people I've met on campus said the same about large classes and less time with profs outside of classes. I took physics 1 last semester (assuming you took with either Dr. Krivosheev or Dr. Beznosko, I took with Dr. K!) - so it's awesome to hear that you're doing fine at Tech with Clayton classes! 

If you don't mind me asking, how was the 'difficulty' transition? I had heard that Tech's classes were a lot harder than CSU's, but so far I've only really just noticed that Prof's are less lenient with due dates and late work. I'm not really the kind of person that can waltz into a class and not study, so I'm definitely interested if there's any shift in study habits for you! I'm taking an online ECE class this semester, and already I can see that there's a lot more focus to meet with TA's or tutors before professors.

I already joined the IEEE, and I'll probably see if I can join some athletic clubs too at the start of next semester! I don't think that I've ever been in a classroom with more than 50 people before - so already that's a little intimidating.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat_smile)

comments,"i also had dr k! she’s a great professor. i remember that we only covered the basics in her class and didn’t go too much in depth. her tests reflected this and you were usually fine if you knew the basic procedure for problems. she was also much more willing to change the syllabus throughout the semester. we didn’t finish the circular motion unit, so she decided to not include it in the final. this also happened in some of my other classes at csu like calc 1 and 2 and chem. she also gave us an extra final project to lift up our grade bc a lot of people did bad on the second test. at gt, you go much deeper into each topic and the syllabus is very strict. there aren’t many extra credit opportunities and the professors always get through all of the material. the tests are challenging bc they don’t just go over the basics. you have to truly know how to apply the basics bc you’ll see situations that are different from what you saw in class. i don’t think my study methods have changed, i just have to study more than i did at csu lol. i mostly review homework and do old exam problems and that’s usually good enough for me. sometimes i’ll grab a whiteboard in the library to do practice problems bc it’s a nice alternative to doing problems in my notebook. i think where you study is also a very important part. my favorite spots are crosland 6, price gilbert 4, and the mason lobby.

it’s really good that you’re already a part of ieee! in asce, we have a lot of different competitions and then we go compete against other schools. idk if ece is like that, but it’s really fun bc you get to do work related to your major and you also get to meet other people in your major. it’s especially nice to be able to talk to upperclassman and learn about the classes you’ll be taking later. if you want to do athletic stuff, intramurals are a great place to start. there’s also almost always pick up games going on at the crc during the weekends. as for class sizes, it can definitely be a bit scary to walk into a big classroom, but ultimately it works the same way as the classes at clayton. just try to get a good seat that you like and listen to what the professor has to say. i’d also recommend to talk to whoever you sit next to on the first day so that you know someone in the class. most people here are really nice and willing to meet new people. there isn’t much of a competitive culture between students bc everyone wants to see each other succeed.",positive,0.9933,positive,0.22769146005509638,06/06/2023

comments,"Hey there [r/gatech](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/)! I'm a rising first-year Computer Science Major and I'm currently researching my courses for next year. Since I'm not too clear on the average first-year course schedule and which classes are a priority to take for my freshman year (or in general), I feel this would be an excellent place to ask.

I'm also not too sure which Computer Science Thread I would like to pursue, but I think the two Threads Intelligence and Devices seem to catch my interest the most. My school does not provide AP Comp Sci, so I'm pretty much starting off with little to no prior knowledge.

I'm also not sure if I would like to pursue an engineering major/minor (probably not because I've heard the Computer Science major is already difficult in itself).

The classes I can skip out of that are on the required courses:

1. MATH 1551 and 1552
2. PHYS 2211

Credits I'm not sure I can use:

1. CHEM 1310
2. CHIN 1001 and 1002
3. EAS 1600
4. PHYS 2XXX (idk what these X's mean)
5. PHYS 2212 (might wanna retake)

The classes I'm waiting to see if I can skip:

1. ENGL 1101
2. PSYC 1101

My schedule that I'm thinking of is:

First semester:

1. ENGL 1101 (3)
2. CS 1100 (1)
3. CS 1301 (3)
4. POL 1101 (Need advice on the required SS courses) (3)
5. MATH 1554 or 1564 (idk which one is better) (4)

Second semester:

1. ENGL 1102 (3)
2. CS 1331 (3)
3. A SS course (idk which one i should take... recommendations pls) (3)
4. MATH 2550 (2)
5. Lab Science Sequence (I'm not too sure what Labs with sequences are, so any info is greatly appreciated) (4)",positive,0.8939,positive,0.10108695652173914,06/06/2023

From all the blogs I've read and even from the GT website themselves, it seems as though if you meet the requirements you should get in. 

For your situation, I think if you have already emailed the transfer admissions detailing your issues, just see what they say. Hopefully they are lenient. I had an issue sending my final transcript to GT by June 1 since my university had locked out the official transcripts until June 7, so I emailed the transfer admissions committee and they actually extended the deadline to June 8, and said that if I was unable to send the transcript by then, I could self report my scores. I was able to work with my university's registrar to get them to send it before June 7 anyway luckily. So hopefully for you if you've emailed them and explained you situation they should be lenient.

comments,"Small terminology note: GT refers to its undergraduate classes as first year through fifth year (or later). This is to accommodate the fact that many students co-op and/or require more than 120 semester hours to graduate.

Dining halls are literally dirt. Squirrels live in the rafters of Brittain. There was a sewage leak at North Ave Dining Hall that dripped into the food.

Second years can live in campus apartments like North Avenue. It's almost unheard of for a 2nd year or up to live in the trad dorms unless they are an RA. To make it sound more realistic, include some wacky maintenance problem during a week from hell. Or, have the protagonist sleep in the library more often than their actual room.

The crosswalk at Ferst and Atlantic is a campus landmark and connects to the Bioquad where some classes and a ton of research happen. Deserves a shoutout.

I am not anti-greek life, I spent a while in a sorority myself and enjoyed it! (I was not a Zeta, I just picked that house based on some research about the specific houses at Tech). As I mention in that thread my experience was suuuper artificial but that's actually a big part of what drew me in. Environments like that are often a game/competition. Fun when you're 18/19 and want to make cool friends to fit in at college but as you get older many sisters find that isn't what they want anymore. In that thread I was shocked that this person was so deluded about the sorority experience. Yes you can make amazing friends and have genuine memories and lots of greek life (especially coed and themed houses) are trying to change the mean girl stereotype and be actually kind, but there are also a lot of rules girls need to follow to keep up appearances. Most sororities (at least top ones with campus houses) are all about appearances and I am no stranger to that fact.

If the girl in that thread is a Zeta as well it is a complete coincidence. I've had the beginning few chapters of my novel written for about a year now (got side tracked with other hobbies and am now getting back to the book) so they are completely unrelated.",positive,0.989,positive,0.11216666666666669,06/07/2023

As a first year and even second year, you'd double up on labs all 4 semesters which was brutal academically - this included a mix of gen bio, gen chem, orgo (aka synth lab), and physics labs. 
In general tho, bio majors were predominantly female than male, and GPAs were better than the engineering majors. You could sorta pick a concentration within the bio dept and focus on molec/cell bio, quant/comput, health sci, plants, evolution. A fair chunk were premeds or pregrad. A lot of us did research on campus, and even had some friends intern w CDC, Atlanta zoo, or aquarium.

comments,"The biology major is mostly relegated to a block of four buildings on campus called the bio-tech quad, which is mostly on the north edge of campus. A lucky sophomore who is focused on their classes would most likely shoot for west campus housing, specifically the eighth street or center street apartments which are extraordinarily close to said biotech quad (ironically, North Avenue apartments are actually on the very southeast side of campus). 

Since she does live on that side, Rocky Mountain pizza like everyone else is saying is most likely where she'd go. Unfortunately, West Village (the sining hall directly across the street from eighth street apartments) has changed to the point where you have to pay just to be inside. But if you like, you can write it as an open access dining hall, which is what it used to be. There are also various restaurants on Northside Drive such as Chick-fil-A, burger King, waffle house, cook out, McDonald's, and Krystal. Just on the south side of campus near Paloma West Midtown is a place called WingNuts, and they serve amazing wings. There is also a bar somewhere in Midtown Atlanta called the vortex, but you have to be 21 to enter.

Also, I think one of your replies mentioned something about fantasy fights and what not. An interesting setting for, well anything really, would probably be the tunnel system under that bio-tech quad, which we use to move around lab equipment, or just to get to another building without getting wet in the rain.

Probably like on your campus, we get student ID called Buzzcards, which give us access to certain buildings after hours. This can include the learning commons in the center of campus, whichever apartment building you live in, dining halls, the specific building your major is housed in (I think for biology it's the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Biosciences aka the biosciences building), and any building you or another person has requested access for you to have, such as for research labs and on campus jobs. Thing is, when you have access to one biotech building, you technically have access to all of them via the tunnels (if only in one direction).

Sorry for the wall of text. When you go here for such a long time like me you end up learning little things like that.

comments,"the majority of greek life students do not live in dorms as a second year. the most popular apartments are SQ5, the standard, here, UHouse (gross), or the biltmore

for clubs, we used to go to buckhead but covid killed that a bit. there were “welfare wednesdays” at Moondogs where things were dirt cheap like $1 beer and wine until 11pm.

Veranda was a newer bar post covid in midtown that people hung out but quickly became a hot spot for minors.

once you hit 21, most people go to Dark Horse (normal bar on first floor, karaoke with live band in basement is where most people hangout).

zeta, adpi, and phi mu hangout the most with Fiji, Beta, KA, and SAE (some people would probably argue for more or less frats). frat parties are also really big, and most frats do date nights almost weekly (sometimes chill like painting, others are out of town) and sororities have date likes like 3 times per semester, and we do mixers with frats (3ish frats per semester depending on the sorority) srat date nights are ALWAYS themed (70s, camo, my tie, etc.)

rocky mountains a great trivia / pizza chill place, not a going out bar by any means. another great place is cypress. we would also bar crawl on the beltline a ton and hit the breweries and bars along the way starting from ponce city market all the way to pour taproom.

i would definitely note the major because business majors at tech can party and enjoy greek life (generally) a lot more than most engineering majors

comments,"[This Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditions_of_the_Georgia_Institute_of_Technology) is surprisingly good. In terms of just existing on the campus though, the Whistle is omnipresent, loud, and can be heard from anywhere within a half-mile radius of Tech Tower - sometimes further, depending on the weather. If the novel involves going to some kind of otherworld, it could be a good anchor point upon returning.

The busiest inter-major class buildings are CULC (Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons) and Skiles (it's awful next door neighbor no one wants to use), both right in the core of campus. CULC has giant sweeping staircases that would be a great set piece for a fight or chase with verticality, while Skiles could focus more on spooky/horror of its back rooms after classes, once-bustling halls turned to dark, lonely places by the setting sun, haunted only by a few math grad students so dead from stress one wonders that they haven't been worn away into specters (and sometimes a political student org meeting).

That's the other big component about Tech: The stress. It's one of the highest-workload universities in the world, and some professors even take pride in that. It's slowly changing, but you can't talk about Tech and not talk about the crazy workload.

I recently came across GaTech's co-op program while exploring university options as an international transfer student, and I have a few questions I hope you can help me with:

1. For a duration of two semesters (fall/spring) without including summer, how many days typically constitute a co-op?
2. Is it possible to participate in only two co-op semesters, or is it mandatory to complete three co-op semesters?
3. As an international student, I am restricted to a maximum of 365 days on Curricular Practical Training (CPT) to maintain my work authorization status after graduation. Considering this limitation, would it be feasible for me to have a 1. co-op in the spring/fall and also pursue a 2. summer internship? Or would it pretty much exceed 365 days?

comments,"Some helpful info I got from calling admissions about transferring: (not a question)


Hello, I've been working towards transferring to GT with my arts and sciences pathway.

1. Most students wonder if the pathway is guaranteed. I inquired about it, and the lady I was talking to gave me this exact sentence:

""The moment you completed every requirement, your decision was made. It's essentially guaranteed since you were in good standing with your current institution.""

Answers from admissions representatives may vary, and most don't like to use the word ""guaranteed"", so definitely call and find out for yourself.


2. CLEP credits do transfer to tech. The representative logged into my account and told me that she could see all 12 credit hours as regular classes. When a transcript is sent in to Tech, apparently the person doing the course evaluation is not able to see that it is a CLEP credit. 
Keep in mind that this only works for transferring credits in from another school, as Tech does not accept CLEP scores.

However, this will vary by school. I'll add my own example.
I was also considering UGA for a bit so I applied and got accepted. I lost all 12 of those hours and would've been required to retake 4 classes to get the credit back. They also don't have an appeals process for CLEP credits, as they pride themselves on being a traditional school.


I would encourage calling the admissions office and asking the same questions, as polices often change. Feel free to ask me questions, and I'll answer them to the best of my knowledge.",positive,0.9873,positive,0.16666666666666666,06/08/2023
comments,"One thing I would note is that housing is extremely scarce for Tech students. I applied for and didn’t get dorm living even as a first year. So a lot of people live in off-campus apartments (they’re hella expensive but what are you gonna do?) If you decide to go that route, Inspire Atlanta, The Standard, The Mark, and UHouse are some you can research to get an understanding of their layouts. I believe all North Avenue apartments (on-campus student housing) are four-people to a dorm, so if you were messing with the number of people, I would say go off-campus. 
Also, people don’t really use the terms “freshman”, “sophomore”, etc. here. It’s bc so many people do co-ops or just take longer that many graduate after 5 years. So we say first year, second year, etc. 
Lastly, I would look into the Zell Miller and Hope Scholarships in GA. It might be a good detail to use if you’re setting up your FMC’s financial background. Essentially, it works like if you have a 3.7+ in high school, your tuition is 100% covered in college as long as you keep a (lower threshold) GPA. That’s Zell and Hope would be a small percent of tuition covered. Hope that helps! Good luck with your book!",positive,0.9899,positive,0.1435479797979798,06/08/2023

That being said, you may also want to consider what your specific remaining classes are demanding from you. Are you taking capstone/senior design? Are you taking any other labs? Are the classes notoriously difficult and/or time consuming? This may impact your decision.

Thank you again for your help and advice!

It's also good to know about the extra credit thing - I had heard of something similar but was told most profs tend to curve the entire class instead.

And thank you so much for the study spot tips! I really appreciate it since tech's campus is so huge - and it seems like they just keep building more buildings!

Dr. K did the same to us too! 😅 We got to the end and she basically just said it was easy to learn by ourselves and that we wouldn't be tested on it! Physics 1 was my only class at CSU where despite doing well on the tests, I'm not sure I had any idea what was going on in that class lol.

(Also, weird question - but did she push you to take statics with her hard too? She gave us multiple 10 minute lectures towards the end of the semester about how we should take statics before physics 2 with her in the fall.)

And then he only starts 5 games in his college career and is frankly not a good pitcher at all for the Yellow Jackets. But the scouts still think he has unlocked potential and he signs a minor league deal. So like what is the coaching staff doing that they can't get anything out of their highly touted recruits?

I don't think anyone is opposed to companies doing company things, it's the unilateral shutting down of options that I take ire with.

> That users should have a say in vendor/vendee cost negotiations? That we demand a better native app?

I don't see why we shouldn't have a say, and yes, the app is genuinely awful.

This site's hardware has always been owned by a for-profit company, that's never really been in doubt and anyone who thought this platform was just altruistically hosting was deluding themselves. But there is a wide gulf between doing things to keep the lights on and what Reddit is doing. This is a pretty naked push to shove users onto their native app so that they can get more user data to sell to advertisers. If the new paradigm required me to have a Reddit premium sub to use my 3rd party app, I'd probably do that, but I'm not going to be forced off of the gangplank to do so.

> Bigger picture, I am skeptical that 3P apps will become extinct. It will cost reddit users and an opportunity for an important stream of revenue. Why is everyone so adamant that apps closing down is the only possible scenario?

Because the app creators have stated so? You can do the math yourself, it's not possible for these companies to stay open and eat a million-dollar operating cost increase.

Just as a possible example, the 3P apps will have to serve reddit ads or provide data from their users back to reddit. Idk how it would work but I’m sure they could figure it out. 

And as for other parts. Aren’t the app creators just bargaining as well? And taking advantage of redditor populism to better position themselves? 

I’m not sure why I should pick a side when it’s just corporate politicking playing itself out.

It's either about profits, or morals. If one could make a case about copyright infringement, then it's about morals.

Reddit didn't do that and didn't provide any alternative to the latter (and about the former, I have no idea what's the difference, never used those, but I appreciate people having the ability to view a website at a layout they prefer). So, we aren't doing anything immoral here. 

If it's about profits - there is a reason B2C companies care about their PR and appearance. If that gains enough traction, there is a reasonable chance that Reddit sees the backlash of users and backs down.

Reddit could have gone about it in a nice way by buying out or offering jobs to the top 3rd party apps like Apollo, Narwhal, etc. but instead chose to lead them on and then attempt to gauge them. To be fair, they did try that by buying out Alien Blue and launching an official app, but they botched it by having a terrible launch and not making these API changes back then.

It's not about the 3rd party apps or how Reddit hates blind people or whatever. It's about Reddit leadership being a completely soulless operation for the past 5-10 years at this point.

I used to build APIs in my first job. As a result, I understand keenly how idiotic it is to act like the overhead cost of storing and fetching data is anything more than a fraction of a cent. 

Why should I not whine about a worse UI? The Reddit video service doesn’t even work properly after how many years of investment?

And the idea of 3rd party apps being illegal is genuinely laughable, this API has operated with Reddit’s explicit legal and corporate blessing, nearly unchanged for the 10 years I’ve used this website.

Other companies like Google/Spotify have taken down 3rd party apps in the past citing copyright infringement. It's definitely a grey area ethically. 

Spez also said that protecting user data against LLMs was also a factor. I don't believe they consciously thought of that when making this decision, but paid APIs are definitely becoming the norm nowadays. At the very least this should help prevent reddit from being dominated by LLM bots which would be a huge problem.

comments,"> A multitude of reasons contributed to the race's eventual cancellation. Property owners along the river complained of the public drunkenness, drug and alcohol use, and nudity, exhibited by both the participants and spectators. In 1978, amid increasing environmental concerns in the country, President Jimmy Carter signed a bill creating the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area. By 1980, the race’s last year, the National Park Service had to budget an extra $50,000 to bring in additional rangers, some from as far away as Washington, D.C., to handle the large crowds that attended the event. In addition, local authorities began to crack down on the event's participants by issuing citations for public drunkenness, and in 1980, Fulton County towed an estimated 4,000 cars. The 1980 race also saw a drowning, the only one in the race's decade-plus run. Thus, following the 1980 race, an overextended park service informed race organizers that if they wanted the event to continue, the sponsors would have to pay for security and cleanup. The sponsors refused, and the event was cancelled indefinitely.

Google v. Oracle isn't the same situation... at all. Using an API isn't the same as reimplementing one. The transformative nature also has nothing to do with the cultural relevance of Android vs Java, but rather the ability to apply existing programming knowledge in a new computing environment.

There is no question that usage of the Reddit API is not a copyright violation - not by Reddit, not by ANYBODY. If it were, open APIs would not exist. The existence of open APIs is literally for their use by third parties.

The problem here is NOT the legality of Apollo using the Reddit API. Reddit is legally free to make their APIs private. The thing in question is the fairness of the pricing model of access to their APIs.

Edit:  
To reiterate, Apollo has no need to be transformative to use Reddit's API. And they're allowed to make money so long as they don't have some legal agreement with Reddit that prevents them from doing so. In fact, Reddit would very possibly want them to profit in order to pay Reddit for accessing their API.",positive,0.9517,neutral,0.00872053872053872,06/10/2023

Your argument is just ""Since Reddit previously allowed it in their open API it's ethical."" Which is so wrong I can't even begin. Like yes, it was allowed when it benefitted reddit but now it doesn't so it's not allowed anymore. 

I genuinely don't understand the alternative. Any official app with a great open API can be ripped off with no consequences? That's just going to destroy open APIs since people could just emulate your app and bypass all your monetization.  

Is your opinion a pseudo-political one where you're just rooting for the small guy because they're the small guy?

The Apollo dev is so clearly ethically misguided at this point. He's just profiting off being able to deliver a site he didn't create to mobile users. He doesn't own Reddit at all, he's just a middle man between Reddit and mobile users. It's so obviously scummy I don't know how anyone can defend it lol.

Do you think ad blockers are ethical? They're legal, but no one would really say they're ethical outside of extreme scenarios like malware/NSFW/etc. Now what if these ""ad-blockers"" blocked the website's ads but added their own and profited from that? That's literally exactly what Apollo was doing, replacing reddit's ads with their own and profiting off them.",positive,0.9782,positive,0.1483716475095786,06/10/2023
comments,"youtube-dl was legally challenged by the recording industry on grounds of the DMCA, not Google. It was on the grounds that it circumvents IP protection technology. You will see that youtube-dl was restored, because as a tool it does not violate the DMCA, though potential usages of youtube-dl may infringe on the copyrights of the people who uploaded the content. It appears Audials does not circumvent such technologies either. youtube-dl seems to just use a regular web API as anyone's browser might.

My argument has nothing to do with the ethics of 3rd party clients. **My argument is that your copyright argument has no legs to stand on** and that you should review IP law before making strong claims.

Besides, you're awfully hypocritical defending Reddit's change in API policy while calling Nintendo out for protecting the trademarks that their business clearly depends on and can't afford to lose protection for. 

Businesses are free to adapt to ad-blockers, whether it be by making content harder to access or integrating ads into their products in different ways that are harder to block. Reddit is free to do what they want to their API, and their userbase is free to consider their management out of touch and to be unhappy with their product.

I personally view the Nintendo situation differently because I view them as going after art while I view Reddit as going after a competitor. I understand that legally Nintendo is required to do this. I don't believe that a fan remake damages Nintendo's trademarks while it's clear that Apollo does damage the official Reddit app. 

I think we just fundamentally disagree on whether Apollo is doing anything other than repackaging Reddit. I view them as just ripping off Reddit, albeit in a currently legally protected way. Compared to something like Linux or Android that ""ripped off"" UNIX/Java in other ways like reverse engineering, I do not believe Apollo is transformative. 

Apollo and other apps have damaged the relationship between devs and open APIs. No company, not just Reddit/Twitter, will be giving devs the ability to create something like this again.

I became the designated sober floater one year, by default. Jeeez, the number of rafters was astounding, the drunkenness ubiquitous, tons of trash were left in the river, people defecated on the bank or in river, and worse.

 I remember we floated by a guy in a small raft that was rapidly deflating. His head was barely above water and he was barely able to say, “help me.” My fellow rafters were too intoxicated to notice. I pulled the guy up on a rock, but had to leave him. Never saw an obituary, so figured he made it.

Had to drag one of our rafters up the ramp at Paces Mill, who was passing out and throwing up.

The fun part was not enough to make me go again, although I often road my bicycle to watch the drunk, sunburned, worn out, crawl up the ramp.

All in all, I think that the situation has just highlighted the problems of an internet which is largely centralized to few companies.

I think a large part of Reddit is just anti-capitalist and is supporting Apollo solely because it's perceived as ""going against the corporations."" Similarly, I think the majority of Reddit support piracy, especially against large companies they perceive as bad. Also, a lot of people in this thread (even the OP/mod) were just like ""I'm complaining because I don't want to use a worse UI."" It's not even about the implications of Reddit's decision or the alternative where they let these apps exist, it's just complaining about an inconvenience. 

Agreed that the internet is controlled by few large companies, especially in social media. There is a real lack of new ""young"" social media right now compared to a decade ago when Vine, IG, Reddit, Snapchat, and Twitter weren't run by suits as much. Now these sites have just been corporatized like Facebook. The convenience of only having to keep up with 1-2 social media apps is worth it. Too much of the new social media is gimmicky like BeReal for example.

I am in wireless VLSI design, and I see that in most companies in this area in US, the average age of Design Engineers is 40+ and we have very limited folks getting in as New college grads. Having said that there are lots of interesting problems to be tackled like 6G, AI, IOT and edge devices, analog based neural network, Satellite communication etc.,  I know a person who did MS ECE from Columbia and joined Investment banking, so even doing an ECE you wont miss out software jobs. Also keep an eye on LLM's on what kind of problems they could tackle and how the knowledge gained through your education could use them or augment.

comments,"Not going to distinguish my comment since I don't speak for the full mod team, but here's my response.

> Why do you or any other mods think you have the right to unilaterally shut down subreddits. This subreddit isn’t your personal property- you’re a volunteer janitor. 

By virtue of being the people maintaining the space. I'd also like to push back on this framing; mods are also users of this subreddit. We weren't brought in externally, every single one of the mods was a user just like you, so to frame this like we are taking a ball and going home isn't fair. These decisions have been hotly debated in the internal mod chat for the last weeks.

If the userbase in aggregate believes this is misguided, then we will reconsider our stance, but for now we believe this stance and protest will overall result in the best community possible for all of you. The mods here put in a lot of F R E E time into maintaining this place, these are not idle decisions.

> I’m sure most people here don’t care at all about Reddit’s API changes. Even if most people thought this was a good idea it still wouldn’t make sense to shut down any subreddits because those people could just voluntarily not use Reddit and contribute to ad revenue.

This is somewhat unrelated to the topic of reddit but the purpose of protesting as a whole. Protests are supposed to be inconvenient. Train protests in the UK result in thousands of people being late for work. I'm sure that pissed off a ton of passengers. That doesn't make the goals of the drivers any less important, though.

We believe we are in the right here on the API issue. When that changes, we will re-evaluate, but as of now I do not think that the disruption to end users is outweighed by the damage sitewide solidarity will do to the admins goals.",positive,0.8429,positive,0.14990740740740743,06/16/2023

This is fucking stupid. To make an effective protest you have to like actually cause disruption. Going dark one day a week is not disruption. All it does is inconvenience your userbase.

At this point it is pretty clear that most of the user base of reddit doesn't fully support these protests that's why most of the larger subs are back online. Frankly the first few comments here support that view though we should be careful taking a few loud mouths as the voice of this sub.

Frankly, I don't really care what y'all do. I just think it is stupid to have a one day a week protest when a lot of subs have reopened fully.

MOVEit is also used by the National Student Clearinghouse.

comments,"Can you give a couple of concrete scenarios in which r/gatech is affected by the API price change? Like I'm genuinely curious as to what you are getting by hitting back on Reddit's ad revenue? Do you want the site to keep working (their earnings don't look too good) or merely exhaust whatever remaining power you have? 

To pick apart your reasoning a bit --- you are saying that because the Reddit app is terrible, they should make their API affordable so that competitors can make their own clients, sweeping away more revenue from Reddit? Do you realize how idiotic that sounds given that Reddit is a business? Would you make that decision when your business model depends on a client you control?

As for alternative ways of pushing back, I'd like to offer one: **mods stop moderating**. From what I gather, apart from apps like Apollo being shut down (which as I've indicated before, not a fan of that line of reasoning), the API change makes it more difficult for moderators to perform their duties. This is something I can get behind with --- moderators play a huge role in making Reddit what it is. The approach of no moderation has a subtle benefit: if their API change _truly_ hurts moderation, then users of the subreddit will be affected, which may organically lead of a community-driven blackout, not a mod-driven one; I don't see people leaving Reddit in exodus - merely appending ""reddit"" to my Google search query gives much better results.",negative,-0.5596,neutral,-0.04475308641975308,06/17/2023

comments,"Let me preface by stating that I'm an in state student, but I'll try my best to give any advice that might help out!

Definitely call the FinAid office and ask for more aid. The number you're given at any college is negotiable and can be whittled down with enough persistence. [It has been done before with great success!](https://youtu.be/BGoo1vBXSh4) You can also see if you qualify for state (not federal) loans - I know in-state students get access to the Georgia student access loan, which is a 1 percent fixed rate loan for people who have exhausted all their other aid. But I'm not sure if out of state students can get it, there might be an alternative that I'm not aware of for y'all.

 [Also see if you qualify for an out of state tuition waiver listed here](https://catalog.gatech.edu/financial/tuition/out-of-state-tuition-waivers/). If even one of those sounds like it might apply to you, call and ask.

Lastly if either of your parents are currently in the military, Georgia colleges tend to be very liberal in who they give waivers too (at least from what I've been told). I've got a buddy who is in a military family and was able to get a waiver after just 1 phone call with FinAid.

comments,"Hey, I'm an Out of State student as well and currently entering my 4th year. When it came to financial aid, my second year was only slightly more than my first year. My EFC has been about the same every year. What I can tell you is there are 2 main things I've learned:

1. It really matters when you apply for financial aid. You should apply as early as possible  because financial aid is first come first serve.

2. GT does not give that much financial aid to first and second years as compared to third years and above. My financial aid package greatly increased for my third year, even increasing sometime during the school year. This actually makes sense because some people manage to graduate in 2-2.5 years, so they may want to help out third years and above more to help with minimizing student loans. Don't take my word for it though, that's from my experience and it may actually be different. 

During my first and second years, I did email the GT Fin Aid office to see if I can get more aid, but it didn't work. My advice is to apply during the first week when FAFSA and the GT Scholarships App comes out. This will ensure you during your third year, you'll be high priority for aid. I also can recommend that you look for a part-time job on campus; this can be TA, research, a restaurant on campus, etc. Also, definitely also look at all the stuff rockenman  mentioned. Hope this helps :>.",positive,0.9835,positive,0.13685185185185186,06/18/2023

email got me a super generic reply but the counselor on the phone actually identified my problem for why I didn't meet the requirements",positive,0.4588,positive,0.16666666666666666,06/19/2023
comments,"Wow it’s so great to see the mods get absolutely ratio’d here. This whole thing is genuinely the most loser neckbeard terminally online problem. I don’t care, I just want to see funny memes and interesting/useful shit. Please fuck off with this and go touch grass. No need to lock down the sub for everyone else while you’re doing it.",positive,0.296,positive,0.11767676767676769,06/19/2023
comments,"Yeah the last bus leaves at 6 which is a little annoying but I don't think I'll be staying that late too often so it shouldn't be much of an issue 

I found a Marta route that I can use just incase of this happening but other than that it seems like everyone is saying it's great which is nice to know",positive,0.926,neutral,0.023437499999999986,06/19/2023
