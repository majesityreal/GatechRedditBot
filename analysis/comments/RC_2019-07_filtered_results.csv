comments,"I did two classes in my major (ISYE), one CS class required for my major, and an MSE engineering elective. Here's my summer GTL experience:

- The two ISYE classes I took covered roughly the same content. In fact, for one third of the semester, the professor told people raking both classes to only attend one lecture since the material would be identical (he taught both classes that summer). So the material was dumbed down a lot.

- The CS class was with a relaxed professor. One of my easiest A's at Tech.

- The MSE class was at 4 in the afternoon, so the prof told us not to come on Friday since that's when we'd usually start traveling. He also cancelled a midterm and the final and knew our grades in the class about halfway through the semester.

Not all GTL experiences are the same, and some classes are certainly more rigorous than the ones I took over there. But the professors travel just as much as the students, so they're more likely to be relaxed than they are in Atlanta. And with only 12 or so weeks to cover an entire course, a lot of material will be dumbed down, oversimplified, or not taught at all (which may be good or bad, depending on your outlook).",positive,0.274,neutral,0.034941520467836266,06/30/2019

I couldn't contact the person they had on file as the president and it didn't look like any meetings were happening at all, which was very irritating. That almost certainly won't be a problem anymore though, since the person has likely left and the club should have been removed from the listing due to lack of aactivity.  I didn't have time to make one in later semesters, but you should definitely do it (I graduated this spring). This is imo something GT definitely needs, because the number of people who would be interested is quite large. If I were to join tech today, I'd start a speedcubing club. Definitely look at the guidelines for starting new clubs as soon as you can if you're planning to start one, since part of the process can only be done at certain points of the semester. Also, if you do make one, definitely keep attendance at least a little high so it doesn't die. Make and share Facebook page, and find some other ways to maintain awareness - I was president of a club my last 2 semesters and maintaining awareness for these sorts of things is important if you don't want your attendance to drop.",positive,0.9827,neutral,0.015905032467532467,06/30/2019

comments,"Can't really comment on your first points, but here's how it works:

- For 1k, 2k, some 3k, and I think some 4k level undergrad classes, undergrads apply to TA positions through CoC. The lecturer/professor/students in charge of that course will interview and choose the TAs from the pool that applies. These courses are run by DCI (Division of Computing Instruction), and as a grad student, you are not eligible to TA for these courses.
- For some 3k, and some 4k level undergrad courses (4k undergrad courses are usually crosslisted 6k level grad courses), the TAs consist of a prof's research staff, undergrad students, or grad students. You can probably TA for these classes, but as a grad student without a prof who hasn't taken any courses at GT it's going to be harder.

&gt;Is it worth a try?

Grad TA is worth something like 20k/sem in tuition and stipend, so yeah, even if you spend a couple dozen hours trying to get a position it's going to be worth it.

&gt; what the best way to go about it

You can try emailing profs, but friends of mine who were grad TAs all just went up to the grad TA coordinator and asked for positions.

From what I've heard, it's very easy to get a grad TA position if you've taken a class, done well in it, and they also needs TAs for that class. I assume you're not a Georgia Tech grad so you'll probably have less success than they did.

&gt; Also, can I apply for TAship in undergrad level courses?

Yes, you can TA for crosslisted 4k level undergrad courses and select 3k level courses.",positive,0.9924,positive,0.24515151515151515,07/01/2019

I was an IE Premed, and I ended up just being an IE major because I didn't enjoy life sciences as much as I thought I did, but it's definitively a feasible academic track.

The one big thing about being an IE Premed though is that you really have to be self-motivated. You won't be handed research. You won't be handed the classes to take. You won't be handed volunteer opportunities (these are honestly universal gatech things, but it's exacerbated as an IE.) You have to reach out to professors, advisers, local hospitals to find opportunities for yourself to be able to build that resume that you need to get into a med school.

As for internship and the volunteering, you'll have some long days, but my freshman year summer I interned 8-5 every day, and then went to a local hospital and volunteered for 1-2 hours Mon, Weds, and Friday. It was rough, and you don't rack up as many hours as you need for med school, but it gets the job done. You'll just have to volunteer more throughout the academic semesters.

Academics is a lecture on it's own with a lot of information needed from you to be able to come up with a schedule, but just know the premed classes (specifically the chem track) is more sequential than the IE classes, so focus on your premed requirements first.

Feel free to DM me if you want to ask more specific questions.",positive,0.9436,positive,0.22556818181818183,07/01/2019

comments,"Unfortunately there really isn’t anything more you can do at application time. Make sure that all your required classes for transfer are completed after the fall semester. It’s an instant rejection otherwise. Your stats are good but cs is probably the most competitive programs at the school so if you’re dead set on a cs degree, apply to other schools as well. 


The other option you do have is if you really want to come here is to enroll in your school’s repp program and try to transfer in as an engineering major (I would think ee or cmpe would be the ones you should look at) and then declare a cs minor. I’ve heard mixed things about this schools computer engineering program but am not qualified to comment on it. Getting a degree in ee with a cs minor probably makes you qualified for developer jobs at the big companies (I’m sure a cs student could weigh in more on this) and it’s a great foundation for a masters degree in computer science if you find the degree lacking.

I do believe that having volunteering and work experience helped my application but they did not make or break it, but if you are at the point where you are making all As and have extra time, try to find something. It also gives you something to talk about in your essays, which are fairly similar to regular freshman essays.

comments,"I’ve been running a Programming Space I started on Quora. Right now it’s the second most followed Programming related space (Quora.com/q/Code). It’s sitting at about 23k followers after 5 months and will hopefully have around 50k by time I send in my application. I’ve generated around a million views and even have a few rather well-known contributors.

I’m happy that I’ve been been able to build such a community, and I’ve learned a lot from it. Maybe it will be my ticket to standing out.

I’ve also done quite a lot of community service at a music school in my town (It’s irrelevant to my major, but I assume diversifying doesn’t look too bad).

Lastly, I’m in the programming club and I’m the Chair of Professional Development for NSCS.

comments,"With how driven you seem, I'm thinking you have a really good chance of getting in! Those extracurriculars look great and are definitely sufficient. Think of it as a priority of what you can to at a time to most affect your chances. So starting the semester and right now you really want to go hard on getting that 4.0 this summer and fall bc that is what will be looked at first but once you know you are going to do well in the class, you can worry about the other things. I have just talked with people who want to transfer so bad but don't put in the time that their classes require, sure they are easier at UNG but you want to make sure you know it really well, but I don't think you have that problem. You could also look into helping professors with research, I know there is a lot going on in Dahlonega that is really easy to get involved with, you just have to ask around, not sure about Oakwood

This is what the application portal looks like, it helped to ease my nerves about the process, they don't require letters of rec anymore so just ignore that [http://faculty.gordonstate.edu/mzabdawi/ENGR-2201/SLATE%20TR%20Application%20Overview.pdf](http://faculty.gordonstate.edu/mzabdawi/ENGR-2201/SLATE%20TR%20Application%20Overview.pdf) 

There was a transfer info session early last November on campus with Chad Bryant (the guy in charge of transfer admission) so make sure to go to that, almost everything he says you can find online, but he is a really nice guy and is good to hear from.

Make sure to take advantage of UNG, nearly all of the professors really care about their students, and you can really rack up on the credit hours, I did 16/17 each semester and also took a CLEP exam over the winter break for psyc",positive,0.9929,positive,0.24309523809523814,07/01/2019

There is alot of crime in the area, but almost all of it is late at night, so I would not walk alone after like 9 PM, but during the day I've never heard of a single robbery there. That being said the georgia Tech Police department is very friendly and very well liked by the Tech communtiy and if your brother ever feels unsafe after dark give the GTPD police department a call and they will almost always happily give your brother a quick ride home. Additionally Georgia Tech also offers the stingerette service for free to students that will take you from campus to home park(they however will not run from home park to campus) and operates from 7 PM to 7 AM. For more information see the link below. Overall as long as you are smart and use the provided options your brother will be safe. The crimes almost never turn violent, but criminals know that the students aren't armed and will generally be carrying easily fenced valuables like a laptop, so students are always a target.

However, you'll also need to be comfortable with coding since that's a large portion of DS jobs and you'll have whiteboard/coding questions in some DS interviews too...

The CS track might give you a better coding/technical background, but the IE route does a good job with these and I personally thought the critical thinking, problem solving, and business breath that comes with IE makes for a great well rounded background. If you are going stick with IE, definitely recommend taking classes like Machine Learning, Advanced Optimization, maybe CX 4242? You can always do a IE degree with a CS minor as well!

While I am personally in a consulting career now (lot of IE's end up as consultants), I have had super heavy analytical internships while I was at Tech and have a bunch of friends doing data science internships and FT roles at large Banks and tech firms!

Danielle (7/3/2019, 8:03:37 AM): Hi  X, My name is  Danielle.  How can I help you? 

Me (7/3/2019, 8:03:46 AM): Hi Danielle 

Danielle (7/3/2019, 8:03:58 AM): How can I assist you today? 

Me (7/3/2019, 8:04:49 AM): this may be a bit long winded but anyway I am a Georgia Tech Student. A couple of weeks back we were told we could get free fitbits using our GT email address. I ended up doing this and indeed it came out to be free 

Me (7/3/2019, 8:05:00 AM): it even shipped and I received it 

Me (7/3/2019, 8:05:37 AM): However, late last week we got an email saying this was a mistake and that we would either have to pay for the fit bit or return it by 7/8. With the threat of being sent to collections if this wasn't done 

Me (7/3/2019, 8:05:56 AM): In the email it directs us to the return page 

Me (7/3/2019, 8:06:15 AM): in order to get a return label

In addition to the dashcam footage, you'd likely get a police report, which would include the parties involved, their identifiable information (license plate number, license number), and the approximate time of the incident. The dashcam footage would be corroborating visual evidence that the incident occurred, how things unfolded, and hopefully at least the license plate of the other party. 

If you're bothering to have the dashcam in the first place, you'd also likely show the footage to the responding officer at the scene, rather than bringing it up after the fact without context.

The summer of my fourth year, my tech/team lead told me he'd be happy to act as a reference for future jobs. He offered it without my asking, so clearly he likes me. My social skills were much better and I was generally better liked around the office at this point.

So befriend or find a friend in one of your superiors (don't force it), then ask for it at the end or if they genuinely like you, they may offer it unprompted.

comments,"An internship is what you make of it. 

A common complaint that interns have is that there isn't enough work. There can be several reasons for this:

 * You don't have the necessary security clearance to do their work
 * You don't have the necessary background to work on certain projects (contextual, historical, advanced methods, etc...)
 * They don't want to trust a bigger or more interesting project with an intern. If the project goes bad, then the engineer has to take the fall for it.
 * Some interns just never ask for work and just surf reddit all day (sounds like what the UF guys are doing)

You sound like you're doing the right thing with asking for more work. The best way to go about it is ask someone about a project they're working on. Most engineers love getting help because they're often swamped with a bunch of time sensitive projects. Start off by offering to work on a portion of one of their projects, then when you prove you can deliver you ask for more responsibility. If they are still reluctant then ask if you can just shadow them for the day or if they can walk you through how they do their work.

If you feel like you've at least learned the general material, and the only reason is for you're transcript, it's definitely not worth it.

For many reasons. One,- most interviews don't involve your transcript, so they would never know (besides GPA of course.) It also doesn't affect your 'Major GPA' which is more important on your resume.

Also, it's just not worth the time even if they knew. Interviewers don't care- personal projects, research, are much more important especially in ML. Also, after you land an interview, all your past goes away. If you can prove yourself as a candidate, they don't care what you majored in.

Thirdly, there are a lot of applied ML roles, which don't require a mastery of math/statistics. Not sure if you want to do research/applied, but this is something to consider.",negative,-0.1361,positive,0.10661764705882353,07/03/2019

I gained zero marketable skills during my co-op with GTRI and left as such after 2 semesters.  Others may have better experiences but I found my employment was just a way for them to fulfill government contract promises for as cheap as possible.  The one thing I did appreciate afterwards is the experience gave me perspective on how miserable b2g organizations and defense contracting is to me.

If you're CS, I would take classes and look for opportunities for next summer.  My first company out of college (large Fortune 500) had just developed early-college programs a few years ago that basically pipelined you for an internship and full time employment.  These usually aren't full 10-12 week programs (as that's a ton of investment) but don't be too picky your first summer or 2.

If you really want a network in the dorm, it shouldn't be too difficult to disable the Wi-Fi radio on a router, mine has a button to turn it off.

Most consumer routers cannot handle full duplex gigabit, but the EdgeRouter Lite can and it doesn't have a wireless access point so it's the best of both worlds for a GT dorm where you can't broadcast Wi-Fi.  My office in the Centergy building (on GT's wired network) uses an EdgeRouter Lite and we can pull 960 Mbps up and 960 Mbps down concurrently over TCP.  Note that this doesn't have switching hardware so you can't use the other LAN ports and expect line rate performance.  You'd want to plug in an unmanaged gigabit switch into the LAN port to maintain gigabit performance.  If you bridge the LAN ports on the router, your speed will tank.

USG realized this, and sent a notice to students to either return the fitbits or pay for them (or face collections). Then they dropped the ball on streamlining the returns process, making students complain about it, and bringing more attention (AJC, Reddit, etc.) To the issue.

Probably to save face, FitBit and USG decided to cancel the returns entirely and just let all the fitbits slide.

comments,"Lots of good advice in this thread from other commenters. I just wanted to add that the reason for requiring disabling wireless radios on personal routers is primarily because it can (and does) interfere with the wireless networks that we (campus IT) provide in the residence halls. Lots of money and time is spent ensuring that the wireless infrastructure provides the best experience possible, so we don't want someone's router broadcasting on the same channel(s) at full power to degrade the experience of the people in surrounding rooms.

For any devices that don't support WPA-2 Enterprise (the authentication method used by our primary wireless network _eduroam_), we offer the _GTother_ network. This functions much like a home network would, allowing IoT devices, game consoles, and other things to get internet connectivity.

comments,"Ok so a couple of things I can recommend:

1) Don't be afraid to learn new things, especially if it's for work. The employees and manager should know that you're still a student, and the fact that you're trying to learn things to do your job better is a perfect excuse to learn. In fact, it'll probably reflect well on you that you're able to learn and adapt quickly to new challenges. 

2) If you're still trying to find things to do, talk to other employees (or interns) in the company. Ask them about what their job is like. Most people would be happy to explain the kind of work they do. If you find it interesting, see if it's possible to do some work with them. No company will ever fault you for trying to be more involved. 

3) Take a good look at the workplace environment you're in. The amount of socializing you do with the other interns should mirror the amount of socializing that is done among the employees. Basically, act like you're a full-time employee and fit into the work environment. Whether or not you want a return offer, if people see that you fit well with the company, they will more likely think better of you and will be more willing to help you. 

4) This is somewhat stated above, but it's one of the most useful pieces of advice I've gotten from an internship: The most useful tool to success is not always _WHAT_ you know, but _WHO_ you know. Learn to network with the employees, because even if you don't want a return offer, you never know what their connection will do for you in the long run. At the very least, if you provide a good impression, they may serve as a person who can recommend you to something else in the future. Furthermore, they may be the person to ask when you're having difficulty in one of your projects. 

Remember that whatever you do in your internship (work you've done, obstacles you've overcome, things you've learned) can be used in your resume, an elevator pitch, or an answer during an interview.

It should be noted, OP, if all of your devices have WiFi and don't need higher speed/lower latency (e.g. no gaming or downloading/uploading large files regularly), the WiFi in the dorms is more than suitable for watching Netflix and doing homework.

Personally, I had a hard time understanding vector calculus, but found linear algebra concepts easy. Linear algebra is different from all the math classes you've taken. It's all subjective though. What I can tell you is that the most from calc 3 that I've needed in IE classes are double integrals (2027 and 3232). The most I've needed from linear algebra is basic rref, matrix multiplication and inverse (3133), etc. basic concepts, maybe eigenvectors every once in a while (3232). 

&amp;#x200B;

Pick whichever combination of linear + calc3 you want, doesn't make much of a difference since you don't really need the most complex topics from those classes.

Depending on how crunched for time you are, I’m honestly not sure if studying the book to catch up is the most efficient use of your time. From experience, the practice tests were a great starting point. 

However, if you find yourself unable to even know where to start for the practice tests and homework, never mind the labs, it might be your only shot.

Everybody’s got a different experience, and unfortunately the best advice I can give you it seems you’ve already heard. If you really can’t get effective help from the TA, try and see if you can study with classmates. Often I found that everybody has their own little trick/tip to solving specific problems, which really helped me become more well-rounded in the class.

Me, for example, I took 2 semesters of chemistry and 1 semester of physics simply because I had AP chem experience and felt more comfortable with taking chemistry for two semesters than physics.

1) don't let yourself get overwhelmed.  Many people struggle in college because they didn't have to study in high school. I was that way.   Pace yourself, prioritize, and make sure to get some rest. You can't do it all the night before it's due

2) use every resource available to you. Tech wants you to succeed.   Talk to your professors or your TAs if you need help.  If your really get in a bind, the dean of students is there to help you out.   

3) DO NOT neglect a social life. It has to take a back seat to school, of course, but Tech has a lot of opportunities such as DramaTech (theater),  ORGT (outdoor recreation), Greek life, social clubs, religious groups. You can learn to SCUBA, to sail, b to fly a plane, join the rowing team, play intramural sports, join student publications, or any number of things.   

4) take advantage of research it work opportunities. Not only will it help your job search, it's a good way to find out if you really like a particular field. I know a few people who changed majors after an internship changed their minds about a field

I have plenty of coworkers now who don't have minors in CS or even B.S. in CS and some don't even have 4 year degrees period - yet they still do the same job I do.

In other words, until the supply of software employees reaches the demand (which is a long way off IMO), getting jobs in this industry is shooting fish in a barrel.

comments,"I would like to say this: 

Many years ago I had a classmate in graduate school  in ME who was denied admission as a freshman, and spent two years at a little college in the ""middle"" of Georgia.  He reapplied as  a junior after making a 3.2  at the ""middle"" college.  His first quarter at Tech he pulled a 4.0, the first of many. When he graduated from undergraduate he had  won every academic prize Georgia Tech had to offer undergraduate mechanical engineers, and was one of eight students that class to graduate with a 4.0 GPA.  When I met him he was on a graduate fellowship after having worked six years at a  fortune 500 defense company designing missles (literally, a rocket scientist.)  He won the prize  for highest score in the PhD qualifying exams, and went on to a stellar career as a highly regarded technologist.

&amp;#x200B;

Was Tech shortsighted in not accepting him as a freshman? I suspect not. he was tres motivated to prove them wrong and he did, in spades. I have the feeling that you might well be on the same track. Good luck in your future.",positive,0.9591,positive,0.12149999999999998,07/07/2019

I actually was involved in a class that was essentially a workshop to improve the transfer student experience. Our goal was to identify weak points in the process and give some recommendations on what resources would help transfer students struggle less their first semester. At the end of the course, the instructor essentially said that administration didn't give a shit and he was going back to KSU to avoid the toxicity of Tech administration.

Well here’s the thing the book is useful up to some point it will help you connect concepts on the higher level (which your prof should do in class but they don’t but, that’s another story) you still need to practice problems to do well on tests. Don’t get hang up on every single term definition they use in the book/class (sometimes they will even tell you false things in lectures that if you take at face value it will confuse you even more, “negative frequency” “all frequency at once in impulse response”  are just a few they don’t mean what you would think they mean)

If you're worried about properly planning your schedule for your major, just ask away in a thread or the relevant megathread and some older students should be able to help. Or you can email your advisor to ask for a schedule.

comments,"Given the price, I sort of assumed the overall quality would have been better. I bought it with little knowledge of PC performance specs, which was a mistake on my part.

To start, the hardware is hardly passable. Mine has a nice big air bubble behind the screen so the back (the top when the laptop is closed) is flimsy. The grill above the keyboard (I have the smaller model) is the weakest possible design, so just about any contact beyond the tap of a finger will dent it. The second Thunderbolt port on the side failed me after one semester, so I had to buy myself a better hub that could handle HDMI + cat6 + USB + DC in.

That brings me to the ports. Of course, you can get this from the details on the seller's page, but it lacks ports. There is a USB type A, two Thunderbolts, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a microSD slot. Nothing more. If you want to use ethernet, you need an adapter. If you want to use a display, you need an adapter. If you want to use an old display, you'll probably want to get two adapters to go to HDMI or DVI then to VGA. If you want to use more than one USB-A device, you need an adapter. I know some people are used to this with MacBooks and all, but coming from an older and heftier laptop I feel like it's too minimal.

It gets hot as Hades. Playing Minecraft on reduced settings damn near burnt my thighs, before it couldn't take it anymore and crashed. I suppose the ventilation is poor and the fans have to be tiny to fit in such a small casing. They generate a lot of noise to compensate. Good thing is that most tasking work such as technical renderings or software builds can be done while away so it doesn't matter how slow or loud or hot it gets.

Autorotation is enabled. Permanently. No matter what. If you want to lay down and watch something sideways? Too bad. The keyboard also automatically disconnects if you rotate it beyond \~180 degrees, so you can't connect to an external display and fold your laptop around to use as a HID.

My complaints are regarding prices and locations/availability. Some of the prices are a bit too steep, I wish they subsidized a lot of it.

I feel pretty good about all the calc courses. But I took an easy-A linear 1 class. The professor literally handed A to every student that showed up to class. So I don't have a very good knowledge in linear 1. How hard would this make linear 2 to me? I heard horror stories about DEq. (A lot of work.) Would it be a good combo with linear 2 and probability?

comments,"I've been holding my tongue on Aramark knowing just how bad Sodexo was. The truth is, Aramark will not be much better.

Before transferring, my old college had Aramark and the same problems that Sodexo had here. Bug issues in the kitchen, poor facilities, hygiene issues, cross contamination, and so forth. One of the dining halls was so bad, the dish return smelled like rotten milk all year because they refused to hire a contractor to deal with sewage issues. It was always extremely hot and humid in there, which definitely affected product quality. 

All for the low price of $2500 per semester.

There is no justification for this kind of treatment at any university, especially where meal plans are shoved down your throat because the admins think every undergrad or first year cannot cook for themselves. It is anti-competitive behavior on the food contractor's part and poor administrative practice on the university's. 

That being said, I think we should all raise hell when Aramark shows their asses this coming August - when Nav is still trash, Brittain is trashier, and meal plans are significantly more expensive. Enough is enough.",negative,-0.9772,neutral,-0.034502923976608174,07/09/2019
comments,Yep and this is why GT running their own dining service won't fix anything. They'll just cut costs as much as possible because they have basically 0 standards for what they should be serving.

I managed to bring all my stuff with one checked bag and one carry on - the winters in ATL are colder, so I just bought all my winter clothes on clearance at the end of summer instead of bringing them. 

Since I'm assuming you're a first year, you only really need to worry about bedding, sheets, clothes hangers, and one or two shelving/storage units (think plastic bins) for your extra stuff. Extra furniture is pretty unnecessary, unless you really want a couch or something. 

Would recommend getting a mini-fridge and microwave for food when the dining halls are closed, and a water filter (gets annoying to refill water bottles even if there are hydration stations). Fridge and microwave you can check GT Thrift Shop on Facebook for deals.

* CS 1301 - Python. Didn't take it myself, but as the other commenter says you should learn a lot

* CS 1371 - Matlab. The class everyone loves to hate, but one of the instructors (Kantwon Rogers) is very, very good. Maybe doesn't quite focus on theory as much as Matlab-specific application. You don't take it as CS. Homework is notoriously too heavy imo.

* CS 1331 - intro to OOP, taught in Java (like much of Tech's CS curriculum). You learn a lot in this one, too. *Very* focused on Java, but it's ultimately serving the purpose of introducing OOP, which is dived into further later in CS 2340. Quite heavy if you don't have prior Java experience. Weekly homeworks.

Those are all the common intro CS courses afaik. You could possibly call CS 1332 *somewhat* introductory in terms of content as well, but at that point, you've taken multiple other CS courses.",positive,0.924,neutral,0.04222222222222221,07/09/2019

My opinion on Linear is that it's incredibly tedious, but not hard per se. Unless you have Garoufalidis. (Is he still there?) Otherwise, just be prepared to become anal about intermediate steps.

CS1371 is infamously difficult if you lack programming experience, since it's a different approach to problem solving. If you can get him, you want Kantwon Rogers.

In cases that you are having a political discussion with someone who's more on the liberal side of things, it's par for the course if they don't take more conservative beliefs well. I don't know what brand of conservative beliefs you hold. Some are more worthy of a negative reaction than others, just as many beliefs on the left deserve criticism. Most people can't stand to be criticized   
or change their opinions though.

Universities have historically been hotbeds of political organizing, but that very much dropped off (as did most of the organized American Left) in the 90s. Georgia Tech has been a political void with arguably no active political groups for decades.  It's very hard to argue that the monthly powerpoint presentations of the college Reps or Dems count as active political organizing. This only changed recently with PSA -&gt; YDSA developing over the past 3 years, but while YDSA is definitely building power on campus,  the campus climate is nowhere near the overwhelming factionalism and paranoia that you're describing.

comments,"I am getting hired on full time at the end of the week at GTRI. I initially applied through GTRI's website, but when that failed I found Apex Systems which promised me a 6 month contract to hire. BUT it's more like 6 months, then we decide to hire you, and it takes 2 months for all that paperwork to process. So it'll be more like 8 months contract to hire.

As a contractor with Apex, you don't get PTO, vacations, anything really. You don't get health insurance until after a 90 day period, and then it starts at the next month, so if you're like me and get hired at the beginning of a month period, it could be 120 days before even getting health insurance. My health insurance is something like $150/wk and I still have a $1500 deductible so it's useless because once I'm hired full time, the deductible resets...

Also you still have to go through GaTech interviews before getting the contractor position. So you have to be able to cut through that.

If you're young, healthy, and willing to basically not have any PTO (or vacation, serious pay cut when I was let out for a week for Christmas and didn't get a week of pay...) Go for it.",positive,0.7677,positive,0.13690476190476192,07/10/2019

comments,"Oh, I see. So, what Courseoff shows as the ""reference number"" is the Course Reference Number, or CRN. Courseoff is great for planning the fit of your schedule, but for actually finding deeper info on sections, you use OSCAR, the registration system (which you'll need to be comfortable with come registration anyway as Courseoff won't update fast enough).

Many course sections are restricted to more specific populations, not just all undergrads. Many are restricted by major, concentration/thread (very common for CS), honors program, etc. This usually isn't communicated by Courseoff (exception: honors program sections are often ""HP""), so it's always best to check OSCAR to make sure it's all okay.

Decently time consuming and incredibly frustrating if you miss a detail on the one page+ problems. That being said, I know one of my friends took Garoufalidis, and she complained that that it was test-oriented with stupidly convoluted questions that the prof had to curve the class ~20 points to get a decent grade distribution. I took Geng Chen, though I don't think he's at Tech anymore.  I'd suggest looking at ratemyprofessor and/or coursecritique/grade distributions, especially if you can't find people who've taken 1554 recently.

As for classes... I'd probably hold onto 1554. I'm not familiar with AE course ladder, but of those three it's the only one required for a CS degree. 1371 probably has the fewest consequences in putting it off, so I'd probably go with that. If you want the good lecturer, bonus that it'll be much easier to get him down the line with a higher time ticket.",positive,0.6256,neutral,-0.027854938271604943,07/10/2019

comments,"I started at GTRI full time about 4 years ago after graduating from KSU and here are some things I suggest. General advice for anyone interested. 

1. Go over your resume and make sure to **show** your skill proficiencies through personal or school projects. If you don't have any good projects then start doing projects at home. To give an example, when I was looking for co-op work during school, I put on my resume that I had build a Twitter bot that tracked comments made during the Arab Spring uprising. This showcased my ability to program in Python and generated interest in the project and why I did it. 
2. If you are trying to get hired doing DSP work then you'll want to have some of the following skills: MATLAB, python, FPGA programming (verilog/VHDL depends on the lab), GPU/CUDA programming, PIC32/DSP programming. MATLAB is the skill I would make shine since there are whole groups of people who do nothing but MATLAB. Python is always a good thing to have in your back pocket for productivity, but is also gaining popularity among the DoD community because it is easy to learn and free. Finally, FPGAs, GPUs, and PIC DSPs are commonly used throughout GTRI for DSP. I cant say for certain, but FPGAs seem the most popular with GPUs close behind. There is some, but not much work for PIC DSPs. 
3. Participate in community activities. Things like robot competitions, Maker fairs, teaching kids to solder, IEEE night, etc. Great filler for resumes and part of the culture at GTRI.
4. Finally, If you're having trouble getting in on an entry level position then go to graduate school. While this wasn't the case when I got hired almost 6 years ago as a co-op, it seems to me like GTRI is looking to hire more experienced Engineers that have at least a master's degree. I know this isn't ideal but typically you're fighting against so many people if you're trying to come in without any prior experience at GTRI that it makes it hard to get in. GTRI also loves to hire from their GRA, CO-OP, and intern pools which are also easier to get hired for.",positive,0.9854,positive,0.22130952380952382,07/10/2019

Imagine you graduate grad school without any experience. You don’t look attractive to companies either, simply because you’ve spent too much time studying without actually working. Thats not good for you.

Take some small notes during lectures, and sometimes the smallest details she explains may be on the exam. Overall, her exams are straightforward and mainly deal with scenario examples for terms that you learn. During my semester half the class finished before I did, and I took around half the class period by double checking everything.

Before the day of the exam, she will open practice quizzes on Canvas for each corresponding chapter.

&amp;#x200B;

There were a significant number of courses where I had, or suspected I had, the highest grade in the class. I know for a fact it was at least six separate courses. In one course, my test average (out of, I think, two midterms and a final) was one hundred, whereas the class average was in the seventies. In another course, I had a test average in the high nineties, and I'm certain the average was less than seventy. This was a class of around two hundred students.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never ""self-studied"" before a semester started, and I've never read ahead in the course materials. There were certain instances where a course would cover material with which I was previously familiar, but I do not consider those instances significant.

&amp;#x200B;

I almost always did homework and studied by myself, so my perspective might be skewed, but I have the impression that my studying time was on par with or less than that of the average A-earner, though I might be wrong. I most assuredly never studied to the point of feeling suffocated by my schoolwork.

 I'm fairly certain I'm not a genius. 

&amp;#x200B;

In reflection of my least and most successful grades, I would definitely say there is a correlation between test scores and preparedness. Courses which assigned more homework generally gave me higher test scores. Even though I don't think I made any monumental time commitment to my studying, I believe that my studying ethic nevertheless played a role in the classes I succeeded in. For one, I never left a homework/study problem without an answer I considered satisfactory. This means that I made it a point to make sure I understood *every* assigned problem in the class. The second part of my studying ethic is that I *never* solicited help, neither from students nor the professors/assistants. I would always ask questions/clarification in class, but when it came time to work through the assigned problems, it was all up to me, my book, and my notes. I definitely would not suggest other students do this, but it worked for me. That kind of rote isolation is not something I consciously decided to embrace, it's just my personality; I'm too prideful to ask for help, and I love the feeling I get when I solve something all on my own. In that way, through my schooling years I guess I developed my problem-solving skills more than others.",positive,0.9954,positive,0.11586466165413536,07/11/2019

It's possible to do without studying, but not reliably, so we'll throw that away as an outlier.

If you study efficiently, it's not a matter of huge amounts of time but rather a couple very focused hours every other day.

If you study inefficiently, it becomes a matter of time.

1) Study to understand not to get good grades. This way, if the professor throws you a curveball, you have a better chance of figuring it out on the fly as you have an understanding of the concepts that the question is testing.

2) Practice active recall. I try to recall the concepts and methodologies semi-frequently so it deepens my understanding of the material and I don’t have to cram it all in closer to the test. I do this by redoing homeworks, quizzes and old tests.

3) All classes are not the same. Some classes require you to understand a few concepts in a lot of detail( upper level classes) while others might want you to understand a lot of concepts superficially( intro classes). Understanding the syllabus thoroughly and tailoring my approach to each class has  helped me spend the right amount of time and energy on each class. 

4) First tests are usually the easiest. They tend to test introductory material and I study harder for these tests than I should as they help me build a solid foundation for the class which helps me with future tests.

5) Being organised and proactive. I start studying for tests a week before they are and if it’s a particularly bad week, then I’ll start sooner.",positive,0.9371,positive,0.0766106442577031,07/12/2019

comments,"This question feels a bit incriminating on the humble brag side, but for me I don't self study before the semester. I always make sure to pay attention in class and not pay attention as in blindly taking notes, but pay attention as in trying to actively understand and rationalize the material being presented. I wouldn't say I study for tests more than the average student, but the big way I learn is giving it my 100% effort in lecture and actively trying to engage. 

So my things are:

1. Go to every class.
2. Actually pay attention in every class. If this means putting a ""no electronics"" rule on yourself so you won't be distracted, do that.
3. If you didn't understand anything from the lecture, look it up. Make sure you understand it before the next lecture.
4. Do the homework. This one seems obvious, but if you are doing homework with your friends and they come up with some of the answers, you're probably not going to learn as much as doing it yourself. This doesn't mean that collaboration is bad, but make sure you really are able to do homework problems yourself instead of thinking, ""that sounds right. I could've come up with that.""
5. Sleep 8-10 hours every night. Exercise. Eat healthy. Staying healthy is the best way to boost your body in ways you didn't know was possible. You will actually have motivation to get something done and not be exhausted when you get back to your apartment. I know many people who ignore the staying healthy part and I can see the consequences.


Of course learning is different for everyone, but there is a lot of peer pressure out there to follow bad learning habits.

comments,"This is what worked for me when I was an undergrad. It might not work for everyone, but using these methods helped me get 100 in all midterms I took one semester.

I strongly suggest getting the best professor for a particular class. This means doing your research before registration starts. 

Another thing that I have been doing is to space out properly all of your final exams. I haven't really seen anyone do this, but I make sure I have enough time to study before final exams. Check the final exam schedule before registration and try your best to have a couple days in advance between each final. Taking two finals back to back feels like crap. I've done it before and I hated my life. 

Also, try to make friends with two or three people with similar goals as you. I usually had two or three people in my classes that I could count on for homework or studying. We would compete in a friendly way and we would also push each other to do work. Getting to know the best people in the class also help because you can discuss any questions that you had. 

When studying for exams, I usually tried to begin studying a week in advance. You need enough time to study. I say start by going over your notes for a day or two. The next step would be to gather as many old exams as possible. Do all of them once to get a feel for what might be on the exam. Once you have done this, if your class requires a cribsheet, I suggest you do it now. By now, you will know what to put down. Grab a 0.3 mm mechanical pencil and some highlighters and spend a day or two doing that. Once you are done with your cribsheet, go back to the old exams and practice as much as possible using the cribsheet you just made. You need to get really fast at test taking. Practice for 3 days if possible and learn from the mistakes you might have. You can also throw in some old homework problems here (never neglect them!). By doing this, I was able to finish most 50 min exams in 20-30 mins. The remaining time I used it to check over answers.

Once I have noticed the pattern in the homework, old exams, and notes, I  tried to predict what would be on the exam. I made up different scenarios of a problem and if it looked interesting I would add it to my cribsheet. You would be surprised how many times this helped me out. Sometimes I hit the jackpot and I just had to copy paste from my cribsheet.

If your class allows a calculator, I suggest you invest on the best of the best. I would go for a TI Nspire CX CAS. This calculator is amazing and it helped me so much. You literally have a huge advantage over someone with a TI-84 or TI-89. The reason being is that the screen let's you see what you're actually plugging in an organized manner. Also, solving any matrices is a joke in this calculator (easier to input).

I always treated each class I wanted to do well on as if I was going to be the TA the next semester. Having this mentality helped a lot because it made me want to understand every single detail.


If you want to take everything an extra step, I suggest you record lectures and rewatch them consistently. Sometimes you miss information you were not able to catch the first time. However, doing this takes up too much time. Honestly, knowing every single detail won't help that much. I only did this in grad level classes that picqued my interest.

Another thing I suggest doing is surrounding yourself by people that care about you. This helped me a lot when I was in undergrad. You need a solid support system to succeed at Tech.

comments,"Using a throwaway because some friends know my main account and I don't want to make it seem like I'm bragging.

I graduated a few years ago, but there were a handful of classes where I'm sure I had the highest grade in the class. I did so well in those classes because I did the following:

* Went to class. You would be surprised how my people complain about their grades at Tech, yet they skip out on half the classes.
* Read the book before class. This helped me have context when the professor gave their lecture and it made things make sense.
* I went to office hours religiously. I mainly went to pick the professors brain and to make sure I understood everything.
* I made ""study guides"" as I went through the class and would review them periodically.
* If the professor made past tests available I would study them to learn their style. Even if professors give different tests every year, a lot of them have a pattern (pulling problems from the book, favoring a certain type of problem, etc...)
* I studied a lot outside of class. I would read a chapter in the book, take notes, review my notes, and then consolidate my notes to the main points. Then I'd read over them and make sure I understood everything.

Some of it also was because they were classes I enjoyed. For a few classes I would get the book a semester early and read through it in my spare time.

comments,"Well it’s been a long time but I did well when I was an undergrad in more or less the way you describe. I never really thought there was much of a trick to it. 

I found that what worked for me was going to class and paying attention to what was being said. 

I’m being neither facetious nor snarky here. I mean that rather than take a bunch of word-for-word notes I paid a lot of attention to the lectures themselves and tried to grok what was important from that. I sometimes read on the subreddit students advising not going to lectures and that just seems insane to me. When I teach I actually make sure to give the answers to the questions I care about throughout the lectures. The faculty are curators and are always telling you what’s important to them. 

Another thing I did was try to explain things to others. If I’ve learned nothing else as a teacher, it’s that you don’t understand something until you can explain it. 

I also refused to ever do an all-nighter. I always got enough sleep, especially before a test.

One thing I didn’t do was self-study before. It wasn’t even really option back then before the invention of fire. 

At bottom I was driven to do as well as I could for the things I really had a passion for. For the things I hated I decided I had to do well in them in order to do the things I later wanted to do, so I did well in those, too. It got me through some booooorring lectures and many a weed course.

I'd drop at least two of those courses (they've changed math around since I've been there so I'm not sure what those are) and hopefully that lets you take your chem course at another time. 

Re:8am and 6pm, chem has two classes you have to register for. Your lecture will have a letter associated with it, and you have to sign up for a letter/number combo that is your lab.

comments,"Well, if we assume that the tower is using redstone (why else would it be red, because of brick?, thats stupid!, fight me bro), then it must have at least one power source for every 15 block distance. This means we can assume that one power source can hit ~ a spherical shape of redstone brick, or about 15^{3} x 4/3 x pi. If we assume pi is 3. then we are hitting about 13500 bricks for each minecraft power source. https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone_circuit#Power.

(Actually, since each power source is covering less volume than the optimal sphere shape since these are cubes and also because it would be hard to pack these power spheres into a tower, lets just assume each power source only hits 10k bricks)

if each redstone block is 1m^3, and tech tower is 40by40 m and 7 floors tall or about 7*4 or 30 m, we are using 48k redstone bricks. We are using about 5 power sources to power up the redstone?

MIT is who we like to compare ourselves to, yes. From an academic standpoint, we are often referred to as a public MIT: our academics may not be considered quite as prestigious, but our starting salary and job opportunities are certainly on par. In addition, we have the benefits of a public research university: larger career fairs and alumni networks, D1 sports, more fun (depending on who you ask), and a wider variety of clubs and groups to join. I would say GT is very similar to schools like UC Berkeley, however we are certainly more STEM focused than most other public universities.        

As for UGA, they are our instate rivals. Our rivalry goes back quite awhile; there are plenty of videos online if you want to learn more about why UGA sucks. Anyways, when it comes to trash talking another university, we enjoy picking on them for a variety of reasons.         

However when it comes down to really comparing ourselves to another university,  GT is far superior to UGA in terms of academics and most people wouldn't call us similar institutions.

Most of the physics required in future BME classes is pretty straightforward and if there's anything complicated, there's usually a review of that material at the beginning of the semester. 

Since you are already planning on taking 14 credits, I would not recommend adding CHEM 1315. That class is pretty time-intensive, especially if you're not comfortable with chemistry. A lot of material is covered in a small amount of time. 

Just as a heads up, BME 1000 is a required class for the incoming freshman cohort so definitely keep that on your schedule. The class is intended to be more of an intro to the BME curriculum and your career options as a BME in contrast to GT 1000 which is more of an ""intro to college"" which will provide you with a lot of campus resources to help you transition and succeed in college. 

Overall, your schedule is doable but I would caution you against adding CHEM 1315.",positive,0.8723,positive,0.0734375,07/13/2019

I advise strongly against it, unless you know EXACTLY what you want to do, and can explain the reasoning for the extra work to yourself that's not just a matter of interest. Double majoring between Aero and physics would be very difficult, and might not be very useful unless you know the particular overlap you're shooting for. Also note: doing this, you just wouldn't graduate in 4 years. That said, if this is your true desire, fuckin go for it. Try it out for a year. If you can't handle it, worst that can happen is you drop a class and switch to a single major.

comments,"Will you be attending a FASET session? If yes, BME advisors will be there on the 2nd day to help you pick classes for the fall!

As others have mentioned, 16 credit hours is a lot, especially for your first semester. You might not be able to register for APPH 1040/1050 just because of the sheer amount of Tech students who also have to take the class. Additionally, MATH 1553 is only 2 credit hours but most people find that it's a pretty time intensive class because you have to do a lot of work outside of lecture and recitation. The workload is a lot higher than what you would expect for a 2-credit hour class. So, if you don't take APPH 1040/1050 and MATH 1553, that would bring you down to 12 credit hours which is a lot more reasonable for the average incoming freshman.

For CHEM 1211K, make sure to register for a lecture section (section A or B) and a lab/recitation section (associated AXX or BXX sections). The 6pm block you're seeing is a testing period. There are a couple of lab sections that a restricted to Explore students so be mindful of that when picking lab/recitation sections.",positive,0.8398,positive,0.17629629629629628,07/13/2019

If you really want to major in physics and have a double major, EE would probably complement it better. 

Interestingly enough, when researching potential places and fields for taking a master’s degree, the having different methodologies I’ve mentioned earlier is actually a reason that schools may accept students from DIFFERENT majors into their masters program. For example, Mechanical Engineering into Materials Science Engineering.

To which I’ll say what I’ve said in that thread:

It’s fine to have questions and it's fine to ask them. What's not fine is lacking the forethought to do some research yourself to see if your question has been asked before, or if the answer can easily be found online. See: ""PHYS modern vs. classical????"", ""how do I build a schedule"", ""what classes do I have to take for my major"", etc.

We aren’t just smartasses being elitist; knowing how to search and find answers independently is a basic, fundamental skill you need to be successful in college and your future career. On reddit you'll just get some meaningless downvotes and snarky comments from internet strangers. In real life, asking basic questions you can answer with a 5 second search makes you look like a poor performer to your peers and superiors.

I make an effort to help those with genuine questions, but I’d argue it’s rude for someone to ask a question that’s been asked dozens of times on this sub without making an effort to find the answer for themselves.

comments,"Exactly, the downvotes and upvoted rude comments are indicators that the majority of this sub doesn’t want to see basic registration/schedule/housing questions spammed over and over. As someone who’s been on this sub for years, it’s annoying to see the same questions asked over and over and I’ve had less and less patience for digging through my post history to copy/paste my comment answering the same question several weeks/months ago.

The rudeness is less an /r/gatech problem and more something you encounter with any large enough sub that gets lots of questions. You can see this effect in large subs that get a lot of basic questions like /r/buildapc, /r/malefashionadvice, /r/fitness, etc. 

/r/buildapc and /r/fitness are inundated with simple questions despite having wikis and many guides, those are downvoted and some are removed. Despite having over a million subscribers there’s only a few actual posts with content on their “hot” pages that’s not some sort of question. 

/r/malefashionadvice has fared better with more aggressive mods and AutoMod, most posts there are actual discussion and content useful for beginners, while interesting enough to keep regulars engaged.  Any questions newcomers might have are contained to their daily questions thread, and it works because the mods/AutoMod have been aggressive about removing simple question posts.

Now look at smaller subs like /r/MBA and /r/consulting. Both attract a population with lots of questions, both handle it differently, and both have vastly different engagement. /r/MBA, with 50% more subs than us, is inundated with question after question after question. Most people there are prospectives and there seem to be very few giving actual advice from the MBA side, because there’s no incentive for anyone to stick around after they get in.

/r/consulting with roughly double /r/MBA’s subscribers, (and 3.5x ours) has kept their subreddit culture and actual consultants engaged and active by sequestering recruiting questions to megathreads and aggressively removing recruiting questions that get posted outside those threads. Many consultants will help out in the recruiting threads, most good questions get answered, and the atmosphere there is friendlier than what you encounter in the registration questions posted here because those questions are meant to be there. 

They had a very good thread recently discussing this, and why allowing recruiting questions to overrun the sub will drive away the people who can actually help answer those questions: https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/c7ojh5/unpopular_opinion_rconsulting_should_be_more",positive,0.9807,positive,0.12011144883485309,07/13/2019

comments,"This is a very weird issue I've seen on plenty of smaller subs. 

Downvotes have more of an effect on people's post because of that. However, because it is a small sub, people's posts are still fairly visible, the downvotes don't do anything with regards to keeping the discussion tech related or whatever the original intention of the upvote system was for.

But I think downvoting is still unnecessary for a lot of posts asking questions, and I hope those that are downvoting realize that it's pointless but is a bit discouraging to people that are scared about college. Georgia Tech is a good college, and going into college is a huge stepping stone for everyone. You have plenty of people trying real hard to gain confidence that they can or cannot get in. Furthermore, you have people with Imposter Syndrome trying to make sure that they can make it, despite themselves doubting them. Downvotes don't help people here. I know they don't hurt, but ya'll gotta seriously understand that a lot of people are terrified about Tech, like most other colleges.  

But I think there should still be more mod organization in the sub.

Pros:

* Will teach you mathematical proof.
* Will help you decide if you want to be a math major or not.
* Will break any ego you have. May break your 4.0 streak early (that's a good thing - some people get unnecessarily attached to their 4.0 first semester).
* Shahaf (the professor) is generally kind and reasonable.

Cons:

* ***This class is A LOT of work, even more so if you haven't been exposed to mathematical proof.*** I cannot understate this point.
* Shahaf is a decent lecturer, but some people were occasionally confused by her. Make sure you get a good TA.

Also:

* There's a good chance it won't be offered in the spring, making this a moot point. I'm pretty sure it wasn't offered this past spring.
* For the love of God, go to class. Every class and every recitation. You won't regret it. 
* If you think you want to be a math major, definitely take this class.

comments,"Don’t be a helicopter parent. I’m honestly concerned for the kids that a parent is trying to map out a path to Georgia Tech for them more than a decade in advance. Picking out their college and major for them this far in advance is absolutely insane. There is no way that they have been exposed to enough different fields at that age to know what they want to do with the rest of their life.

I was lucky in that my parents never pushed me one way or another to do anything. I’m fortunate that I come from a family with very deep financial resources. They provided me with whatever resources I thought needed to chase my dreams but they never once pressured me to do better in anything. They never forced me to work with a tutor or to do anything to improve my grades. If I asked for help they always provided it to me. But unless I showed the initiative to ask for help I was left alone to find my own way through things. I only got grades of a D, C, A and a B in four years of high school math. My parents still loved me and were never angry with me. School wasn’t my thing. I excelled in my extra curricular activities that I was passionate about.  When I went to college I found my passion for school and haven’t gotten anything besides A’s.

Let your kids find their own paths in life. Georgia Tech is a very tough place. The people who are here because it’s someone else’s dream and not their own have a very tough time here. We have a suicide rate four times the national average for a reason. Georgia Tech will provide amazing opportunities to those that WANT to take advantage of them but it can also eat non passionate people alive. You have to dig very deep to find motivation to be doing homework at 2 A.M.

No one can tell you a magic formula to get your kids into Georgia Tech. Odds are that with the stem movement in this country the acceptance rate at a top 5 engineering school like Georgia Tech will be in the single digits by the time your kids are applying to college. It is a very small segment of the population in our country who can succeed at the highest levels of the academic world. In terms of the population of the academic world making it to a top 5 engineering degree program is the equivalent of making it to the NFL/MLB/NBA for a sports player. Don’t put pressure on your kids to do something that is not likely to happen. It was heart breaking to watch all of the kids my senior year of high school who were so sad and thought that they were failures because they got rejected to Georgia Tech. Most of them spent their entire high school lives focused on that goal that their parents ingrained into them. I knew a national merit scholar from my in state high school who got rejected from Georgia Tech.

As much as you may want your sons to turn into one of us you can’t force it to happen. I wish I could have an NFL Star as a child but the odds are not in my favor. Let your kids live their own lives and find their own path. Going to a school like Georgia Tech is not the only way to be successful in this world.",positive,0.9968,positive,0.1522481821011233,07/13/2019

The best way to study for his class is to just memorize everything on the slides. His test questions are basically just ""tell me everything about this specific machine or component from a machine"" and the more correct info you have the better you'll do. The way he grades is the person whose answer is best gets full points for the question and then everyone else is graded based on a rubric and how close you are to the best answer.

College is a common time when people figure out what they really want and come into their own living independent of their families. 

It's true you do not need a college degree to be successful in life - learning a trade for example can be particularly lucrative. However there a few instances, if any, where having a college degree is a detriment (assuming you're not going into considerable debt getting it). 

The most important thing in college, besides trying to keep a &gt;= 3.0 GPA is what real world experience (intern, coop) you can get. Figure out what your aspirations and ideals are, and try to find real world experiences where you get to use them. 

That said, it can take time to figure out what you really care about - and in the meantime, again, a GT degree will be a great asset in your corner. 

And while you figure it out - be a college kid! Join some clubs, go to some parties, play frisbee on the green. There's more than just academics in life.",positive,0.975,positive,0.19270833333333334,07/13/2019

tbh, most of the classes you take, you probs won't use in industry, so its probs fine if you don't like college for its academic value. a degree is there just to say you got thru college, nothing more; but if you don't got it, you haven't done the basic tickbox employers look for when they hire people and you've screwed yourself from a basic thing you need. it doesn't have to be the best years of your life and you're allowed to try to rush thru it with the bare minimum (im assuming ur one of those sophomore by credit hour kids if you're raised to be academic) or you can try to ask for help in trying to enjoy it. both are perfectly good options and I've known people who are much happier after college when they have a career and a clearer delineation between life and work.

What always helped me was, even if it wasn't true due to financial limitations, picturing a reality where you have an open option to do ANYTHING you want. Even things that aren't traditional STEM paths. Open a coffee shop or a brewery? Sure. Become an animator? Go for it. 

I found that once I mentally removed the pressures of what other people wanted me to be or what I *thought* were the only ""respectable"" career options, I found what I actually wanted to do and pursued that anyway. I still do this in my career as an alum!

I know several people who left Tech and STEM altogether and have done amazing things. It is totally viable to do that as long as it's what you want to do in your heart of hearts.

If I was popping into campus for a single class, I'd just park at the lot outside Howey. Throughout an entire year, I only got three tickets, which was less than \~$100 if I remember correctly.

If I was staying longer, I'd park at the Wells Fargo across from the student center or somewhere around rocky mountain pizza.

If it was later in the evening (4pm-ish), there is an ungated employee lot across from the savant building.

Also, driving toward the Savant building past the student center, there is a little lot to the side of one of the buildings (Montgomery Knight or something like that), which has a black gate/door thing that they lock during certain hours.

And now I have no clue what to do with my life after college or what I'm even achieving here. I feel like I'm also not getting anything out of it. 

I kind of feel like the people telling you to join clubs immediately are of course trying to help but that won't suddenly just cure your depression. I have it too, and I tried joining clubs based on my past interests but it never worked out. The people in it made me feel more like an outcast. I have no interest in frat parties and they just kinda freak me out. I completely understand how you feel. Just know you're not alone and you can dm me if you want someone to talk to!

If you do want advice or a way of guidance I think you can focus on bettering your mental health. I don't think going to clubs or parties and interacting with strangers all of a sudden would be the best way to go if you have social anxiety or just don't want to deal with people in that environment. Maybe you can just think of some hobbies you have or other interests and build off of that. If you have an interest in drawing or gaming try to start doing that for yourself and your own enjoyment and then start to move outward with that by joining clubs later or finding people online with the same interests.

You may feel discouraged because academics aren’t as fulfilling as you thought they’d be, and because going here was always the “endgame” you or your family had in mind and it’s a little anticlimactic. If you’re feeling that you’re not living up to some expectation you had of yourself or of who you’d be by now / what you’d be doing, just realize that this isn’t all there is to it. There’s not going to be one thing (or even necessarily many) that makes you happy or fulfills you to the point that your life feels perfect. Certainly you won’t immediately get that from joining a club or having a bunch of friends. You might not get that for a long time, even after getting a job or involving yourself in organizations or hobbies. Sometimes feeling like you have a place takes a lifetime.

comments,"Uh, no. Retaking 1211 is a waste of time. Sure, you may get an A, but it's never a guarantee, even if you've already taken AP chem. Any number of things could happen... you could bomb a test due to a stomach bug the night before, or get overwhelmed by other classes and not put enough time into it and end up with a B. You should use the fact that you have credits to take other more advanced science courses. 

I did a quick Google search earlier since I was curious, and from what I can tell, most medical schools simply require X number of semesters of chemistry, Y semesters of biology, and Z semesters of physics. Most don't allow AP credit to fill those semesters.

 But if you took 1212K, Orgo 1 2311, Orgo 2 2312, Biochem 1 4511, and Biochem 2 4512, plus whatever corresponding labs your major / medical school may require, that's 5 semesters of chemistry and more than enough to meet most med schools' requirements. 

Many med schools do seem to require a full year of biology, so you may actually want to consider taking at least one introductory biology course. Keep in mind that they are reorganizing and renaming all the introductory biology courses starting Spring 2020. But under the current system, taking AP credit for BIOL 1510+lab,  then at Tech taking BIOL 1520 + lab and either Cell Molecular Biology + lab (BIOL 3450) or Genetics + lab would satisfy a full year of biology... And that may look more rigorous for medical schools.

As for physics, I believe you said you took Physics 1 or B or something, which doesn't count for much at Tech anyway. So you'll have to take PHYS 2211 and 2212 like most people do.

Lab reports are killer. I and most of my peers in 1212K spent at least 5 hours a week simply writing lab reports. Sometimes 8. That's on top of all the other homework, reading, and studying for the class. If you just want an A, there are other easy, less time consuming classes you can take if you need to pad your GPA. But I wouldn't worry about that as a freshman. You can sprinkle those in during your final years when you are taking a ton of difficult upper level courses all at once. The few people I talked to who took two lab courses at once (BIOL 1510 and CHEM 1212K) said it was awful and wouldn't wish it on anyone.

I took about 30 minutes out of my day to look this stuff up and type up this response try to help you, since you seem to be very bad at doing this yourself. I don't want to sound condescending, as I know this stuff can be very overwhelming (I was a freshman not too long ago), but you really do need to work on searching skills. There are multiple guides from very prestigious schools about what their students should take to get into medical school, from Georgetown, Yale, Duke, Harvard, Columbia, and Johns Hopkins... all on the first page of Google for ""AP credits medical school"". This information all applies to GT except the course codes are different. If you are still confused about something after awhile of searching, you can always email an advisor or department head. But in the future, you should be very sure that your question is not answerable with a simple Google search before you start asking other people. Reddit included.

comments,"6042 is much more time consuming than it is ""hard.""  You'll have to program a compressible Navier-Stokes finite volume solver from scratch.  The programming and debugging will take you a while.  Realistically, it is in line with 90% of the CFD codes in existence, including most cutting edge research codes.  You'll learn a lot about all of the plumbing that goes into such a code (all of which will apply to higher order methods), and it will likely take plenty of your time.  If you do have time left over, you'll have a code all your own to experiment with to the fullest.  You'll also learn details like stability analysis and scheme derivation as well as start to gain an intuition about the qualities of different numerical methods.  All of these things are important tools for all numerical methods.  

&amp;#x200B;

You probably won't have a choice of professors.  It's offered as one section in the spring, and you'll probably want to take it as soon as possible to give you an understanding of the details of CFD codes as you start your research.  That being said, I honestly don't think any of them that I know to have taught it are worth avoiding - you will learn a lot from any them.  

&amp;#x200B;

For more on numerical methods, I cannot recommend Yingjie Liu's numerical methods for PDEs classes in the math department enough. You'll learn a lot about a wide variety of schemes and it will give you a great understanding of the fundamental ways to think  about them.  These classes are especially good once you've taken the CFD class - with a practical understanding of the programming, the math becomes much less abstract and it becomes easier to code up and play with the schemes.  Also, what you learn from these classes will be invaluable as you work through the literature.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be more than happy to talk to you more about CFD and numerical methods if you want.  I understand that high order methods can be hard to get into - like most subjects, classes end before you get to the ""fun"" stuff.  Most of what you learn will probably have to be self taught, but in the end you will understand the material much better for it.  If you want to talk more, feel free to shoot me a DM.

Looking at your schedule, unless I’m thinking of the wrong section, both PHYS 2211 and EAS 1600 (assuming you’re taking that as an incoming first year instead of 2600) both have lab sections which can become very tiring in the middle of the year.

He’s one of the more difficult professors in the psych department but for 1101 he shouldn’t be too difficult.",negative,-0.3147,neutral,0.03418367346938774,07/16/2019

comments,"I did full time work and part-time grad school for several years. I did nine hours once but never again after that. It’s doable, but you’ll be giving everything less than your full attention. 

The most important thing is having the flexibility to lower your hours with the start-up as the semester progresses. Both Video Game Design and Ubiquitous Computing feature semester-long group projects which ramp up the workload on the back half of the semester. I took both and they (like most) are classes where what you get out of them is proportionate to what you put in. I still draw on what I learned from UbiComp years later in an HCI context.

If the startup is full of GT grads, they should understand. If not, it’s probably better to decline working this Fall for the startup. If it were me, I would give my last semester my full attention, especially if I was looking to get the most out of my GTA experience. If the startup is looking to secure funding that points to your workload likely increasing over the semester, not decreasing.",positive,0.8683,positive,0.1824561403508772,07/16/2019

comments,"Take this advice with a grain of salt. Ultimately, you have to do what you this is best. If you can spend 1 more semester and get a minor, then my advice would be to do it. You'll stick out more on resumes just by having it. 

If you pick up an engineering minor, you will probably stand out more when you're looking at technical jobs. Lets say you have your ME degree, and decide to pick up AE as a minor. You'll probably stand out more from other MEs when you apply to Boeing or Lockheed or something in defense. If you go with NRE, then you'll have a better shot of landing a job in nuclear. And so on. 

Personally, I advocate for second language classes for engineers. You get access to projects that you otherwise have no business in by virtue of being able to read/write/speak a foreign language. It comes up a lot if your company does a lot of international work. Mine does work in Mexico, Sweden, Korea, Japan, and Russia (used to) and every single person that can help in the language barrier is involved in those projects in one way or another.

As for the minor you're talking about, every company is a business and you'll be expected to help contribute to the business. If you do a better job at that, then you get promoted faster and make more money. That's just how it works. Its not gonna change what's available to you up front (if you think you're going to be hired as a manager straight out of college, you'll need to temper your expectations a bit).",positive,0.9509,positive,0.2074404761904762,07/16/2019

You could change your major entirely and still probably get out without delay. For God's sake don't delay graduation, just ask your profs for a research gig! You've got 3 years! 

Bonus points if you ask your profs to connect you with their current PhD students. They're the ones doing what you want to do, and trust me, they can use all the help they can get. Plus they probably like talking about what they've just commited a big chunk of their early adult lives to studying.

comments,"What major are you coming in as?

During my ME undergrad I did the whole thing where I bought a heavy, workhorse laptop. Ended up barely using it as it was heavy and cumbersome to use on desks.

All the software you need, you can run using a GT Virtual Lab ( [https://faq.oit.gatech.edu/content/vlab-what-web-address-vlab](https://faq.oit.gatech.edu/content/vlab-what-web-address-vlab) ), which is basically a cloud service where you can login in from any laptop and it opens up a video stream. All the processing is done on the server. It is basically streaming a full screen video. It is anyway easier to use the Vlab vs. having to install, update, and maintain all the software on your personal device. If you need a larger screen, you can always go to the library or the new Crosland tower.

&amp;#x200B;

My personal rec for a laptop would be the Surface Pro, they are portable and actually fit on the small table space you have in many of the freshmen classes. I used one this past semester for grad school, and didn't even need notebooks as I took notes using OneNote and the stylus. Being able to change colors and draw exact lines/shapes using the tools was amazing. Also sketching stuff out and putting it right into project files. VLab worked great on it too.

comments,"&gt;1) What should I focus on learning during the Summer in general? Honestly reading the atmosphere and how hard GT is supposedly has scared me. I have mastery over the basic concepts of Java, and did the IB in high school. (HL : Math, Physics, Psychology, CompSci, SL : French, English). I'm kinda expecting everyone else to be super-coders, so is there anything computer science wise I should learn? 

You don't need to do any studying over the summer. Enjoy the last month of summer before college. You will be starting in CS 1331 and that starts you off with a review of most CS concepts. If you want to do some project on the side for fun, go ahead, but there isn't anything you need to know apart from what you already learned in IB.


&gt;2) From my research, insider information is really helpful. Apparently, there are specific 'weeder' classes or easier classes to fill up credit. I want to work hard but I still want to have a life so are there trap classes I can avoid, or just anything, in general, I should know about classes? 

I can't speak for other majors, but CS does not have weed out classes. Probably the only trap incoming freshmen potentially fall for is MATH 1564 cause they are just used to taking the highest level classes in their high school. Some of the smartest people I know got Bs and Cs in that class. Just take 1554.

&gt;3) This is kinda off topic haha, but I'm interested in the Khalid concert on the 14th but I don't know anyone in Atlanta. Is there anyone willing to go or is there a specific place I should be asking (I already asked discord and Pm'd some people) 

No idea about this one. 

&gt;4) So from my research, is it correct that I don't actually worry about the CompSci threads until I finish my first year, and I just focus solely on the Core requirements found here in my first year? : [https://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/undergraduates/bscs/corereq](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/undergraduates/bscs/corereq)

This is true. Although you can declare your thread any time, you probably won't be taking any thread specific class until your second year. 

&gt;5) Anything else I should know just to live a better life at GT? Appreciate anything and everything :)

Have fun, find friends, and take it at your own pace. When I came freshmen year, I wish someone told me that it's ok to not code in my free time, it's ok to not have an internship freshman year, and that it's ok to not know things that your peers know. There will be people here that have been writing Java programs before you knew that Java existed.

comments,"1. If you don't know any Python, I believe that's the first CS course, so you could go over that. Really, I'd just enjoy a free summer. I haven't had a completely free semester in years, and I wish I had taken advantage of the times I had. (if you're interested in rushing and live close, you could visit some fraternities' summer parties. They're usually really chill, and you could get to know some people)
2. Any Calc or Physics class is a weed-out class. Doesn't mean it'll be impossibly hard as much as it's just harder than it needs to be. If you put in consistent work then any class here is pretty manageable. 
3. It depends. Some are stereotypical, some aren't. They're really more like huge friend groups than anything else. You should absolutely rush. Worse case scenario: you get free food and know you don't want to join anywhere. Best Case: you get free food, great friends, and a good meal plan like you're looking for. Lots of people in fraternities here don't drink, so don't think that they'll make you. Ultimately everyone in fraternities here are still Tech students, so they are far more like you or me than the stereotypes we hear about. (for the record, I am not in a fraternity. I rushed twice and made several friends but did not become a brother anywhere)
4. I love khalid, but I'm going to another concert in a week or so and don't have the money for both. I'm sure you can find someone to go with tho. There are lots of people here who go to concerts.
5. I'm not CS, so I can't really speak to this.
6. Make friends with everyone you meet. Finding a friend group is really important early on in your college career. Go to class. Work hard AND play hard (most people only do one or the other).

1. not everyone is a super coder. that's a very small minority of people here. I know people who are CS majors and had never programmed in their life before coming to tech, and they're succeeding as well. definitely relax and enjoy your summer
2. not really. CS 1332 is a very good class in terms of the content in it being important for technical interviews but it isn't supposed to difficult. the closest thing to a ""weed-out"" course would probably be CS 2110, which would only weed you out of the sysarch/info threads (since they require CS 2200) if you really don't like the material.
3. each fraternity and sorority has their own identity. rush is free (assuming you're a guy since you're talking about fraternities and not sororities) at the beginning of the semester, so just go around and talk to the people there! you'll find out real quick if you enjoy it, and you'll probably find somewhere you like. just go in with an open mind and be curious!
4. yeah I'm not sure either where to find this rip
5. yeah, you don't officially need to declare threads until you take thread-restricted classes, which are 3000- or 4000-level classes. I am entering my second year and just declared my threads this summer, but I won't need it until I register for spring classes (my fifth semester, including this summer). definitely think about it as you take classes, but remember you can basically change threads whenever you want (except during class registration) so you're never really locked in anywhere.

The Me Too movement doesn’t change these facts -&gt; in fact it was a response to them.

So for a team like Alabama or Notre Dame, there are a lot of people who will just always bet on those teams because they’re fans of those teams. That moves the line. So over the long run, betting against the big teams is likely to pay off.

Edit: guess what? It IS a pyramid scheme! We've got everything, starting with a classic [""turn $500 into six figures in 4 months"" claim.](https://i.imgur.com/3gOFbMP.jpg)

But that's not all, folks! We've got a reference to a [""learning platform""](https://i.imgur.com/4cSZnNQ.jpg) called iMarketsLive. So, what is iMarketsLive? A quick glance at their (kinda janky) website immediately reveals an of offering of a ""one-time payment of $225"" (...which then turns into $164.95/mo after the initial promo, yikes!), not including $21.95/mo ""optional add-ons,"" of course.

So, how does a new-kid-on-the-block hotshot forex trader with daddy's credit card in hand sign up for this bonafide goldmine? Well, you can't. At least, you can't without the username of your ""referring member!"" Now wait a second, this is starting to sound an awful lot like one of those pyramid schemes! Can that really be?

Yes, yes it is. In fact, used car salesman looking motherfucker Christopher Terry even [admits it's an Amway-inspired MLM scheme, or what he calls ""network marketing.""](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b19fcfsc2n7jw6/Is-This-Company-a-Forex-Trading-Pyramid-Scheme) The shadiest part of that article is that iMarketsLive told it's users to move to unregulated offshore brokers after their regulated US broker told them they had to stop.

I think he had the same GPA around you but math/science I am not sure about. Make sure to get around 60/70 credit hours and to get A's in the rest of your math/sciences. What I did extra was some involvement such as TA/LA, clubs, etc., and outside of college communities. Having a good Math/Sci GPA, bomb essay (I reached out to people to help me edit mine about over ten times and you had no idea how much it improved from just moving words around), the right amount of credit hours, and campus/community involvement should be what's most important. I would still say add a resume, because it would seem like it would show them that you care enough to get in rather than leaving it blank.

In theory, frats are not allowed to force you to sign a bid on the spot if they choose to give you one. However, there are frats that will definitely pressure you into signing (some might give you a deadline by when you have to decide). To more specifically address your question, if you have bids and rush is over, then you can choose to decline all of them and just not go Greek. Rushing or receiving a bid does not force you to go Greek. Even if you accept a bid and become a pledge, you can still drop the fraternity (as I stated in a previous response, be sure that the frat doesn't make you pay for pledging prior to becoming initiated as a brother). In fact, even if you become initiated as a brother, you can always become inactive or drop out of the Greek life.

However, if you are interested in the Greek life (even the smallest amount), then I recommend you rush. The worst that will happen is that you will meet new people and eat free food.",positive,0.7092,positive,0.07131313131313131,07/19/2019

For a traffic ticket it's usually a flat fee of like ~$200, probably worth it considering the potential implications involved.  It might even reduce the fines by more than the fee amount if you're lucky.

If you can't afford it, go to court, be on time, be apologetic, emphasize that you didn't know you were going that fast and that you've never had a speeding ticket before.

I think because I went to college at 14 and had my Bachelor's by 18 (very long story there) and have been involved in academia most of my life in some fashion, I have an interest in what my son's experience will be like. My parents took a  hands-off approach but I was...14. I did fine. I'm sure you can imagine, however, it was a surreal experience. When I had a question about something or needed guidance, I really couldn't ask my parents. It was exceedingly difficult at times and I made a ton of mistakes which were all good lessons in hindsight. I've tried to take a different approach with my son. He's doing all the work but I don't care how intelligent someone is, they hit roadblocks along the way. He is on a very different academic path - my degree was very liberal arts heavy. I understand Shakespeare but not so much derivatives :). I ask questions here so I can be a good support and provide guidance when possible. 90% of the time, he doesn't need it. So that's my story.

I would not jump to the conclusion that you're in favor of racial profiling based on what you've written here. But there's a big divide between what the popular opinion calls for and what the government actually writes into policy. Comprehensive immigration reform is a bipartisan issue and most members of congress do not support completely open borders nor completely closed ones. But after years of gridlock in Congress, we have an administration willing to use any and all executive power to deport undocumented migrants, which has pretty much gone disastrously.

Obviously not, which is why I support the existence of a justice system that requires guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt before throwing someone in jail for the rest of their life. This is pretty much the standard that divides authoritarian societies from normal ones.

~~​That's horrifying. $20,000 is a piss-poor settlement for nearly four years of illegal imprisonment, and the fact they admit no wrongdoing means that the systems that allowed this to happen are still in place.~~

I misread your response as claiming that Davino Watson received the $20k settlement. I did some further reading and it appears he was completely uncompensated for his time served. Which was later reversed by a second appeals court and he was awarded $82,500 for over 1200 days spent in prison.

comments,"**Blackstone's ratio**

In criminal law, Blackstone's ratio (also known as the Blackstone ratio or Blackstone's formulation) is the idea that:



It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.

As expressed by the English jurist William Blackstone in his seminal work, Commentaries on the Laws of England, published in the 1760s.

The idea subsequently became a staple of legal thinking in Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions and continues to be a topic of debate. There is also a long pre-history of similar sentiments going back centuries in a variety of legal traditions.

I misread what you wrote, but here's what actually happened to Davino Watson: it took six years for him to sue the government after his false imprisonment. He was initially awarded $82.5k for his time served, which the government later appealed and overturned. Watson's case went up to a second appeals court which upheld the first settlement.

So this person was imprisoned for 3.5 years, was stuck in legal gridlock for 6 years, had his case thrown through appeals for an additional 1.5 years, and finally compensated a pittance of $82,500 for losing three and a half years of his life in jail.

comments,"Took both CS2316 with Simpkins and had Watson-Phillips for CS1331. Here’s my take: 

(1) if you felt comfortable with CS1301, CS2316 will be an extension of that but without the theory stuff i.e. recursion and the different sorts. I thought it was the more “practical” coding class. The first test will be a review of Python and in general, if you were okay with Python, you’ll be fine. There was little to no focus on classes and we did the basics of SQL/databases as this class is meant to be a primer for CS4400

(2) i agree, Watson can be a boring lecturer and i fell asleep in her class but i feel she genuinely cares about her students. I luckily took AP CS in high school so Java wasn’t completely foreign but i found the textbook, her lecture notes/topic outline, and homeworks very helpful for exam prep and her tests were straightforward, not really any trickery questions on syntax bullshit. Also, since she is a new teacher, she will probably take advice from Simpkins just as she sat in on Stasko’s lectures for CS1331. If that’s the case, all you’ll really need is Simpkins cs2316 website which has all his lecture notes, practice exams, and practice exercises, which should be more than enough. Also, I think simpkins is cool and all but he slick didn’t have his shit together the semester i took it and was kinda disorganized so the TA’s had to carry which i don’t think watson will be an issue for. 

Use the website, stay awake, do the homework and you will do great. This really is one CS class that I feel the professor tbh doesn’t matter too much. You got this bro/sis",positive,0.9435,positive,0.1580332167832168,07/21/2019

Lol totally not an exaggeration at all.  And totally not completely insulting to people who have actually suffered through concentration camps.  Seriously, how fucking dare you?

No one is being rounded up because of the color of their skin.  Amazing how badly you really want there to be racism where it doesn't exist.  Sick.  Perverse.

These are people doing their jobs, enforcing the same laws America has always had, the same policies every other country in the world has, but somehow it's now suddenly an issue.

Again, this shows how moronic you are and how you enjoy racism, get off on it.  

ICE is targeting ILLEGAL immigrants who have also committed crimes here and skipped.  I love how you paint it like you're so concerned they are intentionally targeting citizens.  Your concern is complete horseshit, you can't even admit that you're supporting illegals who are also criminals.

IMO if you're half decent at coding, it's easier to get a coding job with an EE degree than it is an EE job with a coding degree.  Otherwise, stick with CS. I say this because it seems that for EE you need a pretty solid knowledge background, vs CS is easier to pick up on the job.

When most people say they like hands on stuff, normally it seems to be arduino-type/small-scale embedded projects. In my experience, there is very little of that in real world jobs. The ""fun"" logic-based coding is either trivial and done by a single embedded/systems engineer, or extremely complex and done by research/data scientists.

comments,"The biggest advantage you have when taking 3511 is the smaller class size, so you have more opportunities to directly interact with the Professor and TAs, which can be pretty helpful if you really want to get good with the material, and care about algorithms beyond the context of the class. If you're a theory thread, you should definitely take 3511 unless it has a drastic negative impact of your schedule. Both classes will prepare you for technical interviewers, and other theory/algorithm-y stuff you'll run into in other classes, though 3511 feels more math-y.

3511 isn't more difficult than 3510, it just usually covers a few topics that aren't usually covered in 3510. As a result, 3510 will spend more time on some topics, and you'll do more problems related to those topics. For example, 3510 usually dedicates more time to dynamic programming and complexity reductions, so you get a lot of practice with those topics. In 3511, since more is being covered, you'll go over those topics, but you naturally won't see as many problems or examples, though the problems you do see won't necessarily be easier.

I TAed for 4 algo Professors at Tech, and I'd say the Professor has more of an impact on the topics being covered than whether the class is 3510 or 3511. In terms of material, the classes aren't nearly as different as you'd think. The biggest distinction is the vibe of the class (due to class size) and what type of students they're aimed towards.

TLDR; 3511 is spicy 3510

Transferring is a big sacrifice to your social life. Your transfer could also go bad and end up ruining your GPA. I’m guessing your going to Clemson right now because of in state tuition. If so Tech would not be worth the additional expense. Besides tuition, living expenses are much higher at Tech than you’re used to at Clemson. A decent apartment is going to run you at least $1300.

comments,"I have taken all but the 2 AE classes, but I looked them up real quick to get an idea of what they are. Since no one else has responded yet, I hope my advice will do.

&amp;#x200B;

So CS 1371 is moderately difficult with A LOT of work (it can be very hard at the start if you have no coding experience whatsoever). ME 1770 is also a lot of work, but I never found the work to be all that hard. Know that it is somewhat dangerous to take classes with a lot of work together. MSE 2001 is not really a lot of work, but it can be a lot of studying (memorizing) right before the tests. APPH 1040 is irrelevantly easy (as long as you actually try). COE 2001 can be pretty difficult unless you practice it a lot (it also heavily depends on the professor). AE 2010, I have not taken, but my friend google tells me its thermofluids. I have taken thermo and fluids (which is how MEs take it), and I'll tell you that it is pretty hard and a good amount of work. No idea about AE 1601, but it says its an intro to AE which doesn't sound that bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I'd say it is a pretty heavy semester (much heavier than I'd ever take but I'm lazy). Even if you are a hard worker who likes to be overstressed, I'd suggest dropping something if not two things. Looking at the flowchart, ME 1770 seems to not be a prereq for anything, so I'd consider putting that and/or CS 1371 off (prereq for Junior year stuff only). Since you'll be new to tech, I'd suggest taking the first semester a little easier. It's not a competition to see who gets out the quickest (also no one post-graduation cares at all), and you don't want to kill yourself (and your gpa) right off the bat. Take the extra free time from those two classes and join clubs and make friends to create your support group that you'll need later.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all of course my opinion. Some will say that that schedule is 100% doable, but I wouldn't recommend it especially since you're new. Hope I helped.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh and on overrides: I've never gotten one, but my understanding is that they do not like to give them unless they have to. Just because it's an important class that you need is not really a good reason, but being patient with waitlists has always served me well.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I should add that that is assuming you have no experience with any programming language or CAD software. If you know any programming language, CS 1371 (matlab) will be much easier. Same with any CAD software and ME 1770. Most of the difficulty/stress comes from it being completely unfamiliar.",positive,0.9943,neutral,0.01964556277056276,07/23/2019

comments,"&gt;&gt; many people make the mistake that CmpE is the “best of both worlds” and are closeted CS majors that love solving logical problems
&gt; 
&gt; Cannot restate this enough. CmpE is honestly it's own separate beast compared to EE or CS.

Going to soft agree on these two points. I went with CompE because I was dissatisfied with the introduction I got to CS in High School and wanted to understand the lower-level building blocks of how computers worked.

I ended up sticking with CompE through 5 years of schooling because it turns out I'm a masochist for higher-level math and esoteric engineering topics in addition to coding and solving problems. That said, I might have been better served pursuing EE instead -- CompE is kind of a confused major with a confused curriculum.",negative,-0.1989,positive,0.26711538461538464,07/23/2019

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from that I've also been in the Hapkido, Kung Fu, and Tai Chi class. Krav Maga and Hapkido are pretty heavily self defense based, so if you want to get exercise and learn some practical techniques at the same time those are both pretty good. Krav Maga is going to be pretty strictly self defense and Hapkido is going to be mostly self defense, but with some more traditional martial arts in it as well (meaning stances, breathing techniques, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Kung Fu and Tai Chi are both taught by the same guy and are more on the traditional side. You'll do a lot more forms and stances in those two than Krav Maga or Hapkido, but they're still fun ways to get some exercise. Kung Fu also has a decent amount of early practical techniques. I only stuck with Tai Chi for a semester, because it was slower paced than I'd like, but if that's something you're looking for it may be a good place to start. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly I've gotten some feedback from people who took Taido and Jiukido Jiujitsu though I haven't tried them myself. I've heard Taido is pretty good and is a bit of a mix of martial arts and gymnastics (not sure on the details of what exactly that means, but that's how it was described to me). Jiukido Jiujitsu is the only class at the CRC I've heard bad impressions of. Apparently the instructor is very nit-picky on doing techniques in an exact way and the classes end up being mostly drilling techniques. Again, that's only second hand experience, so I'm not saying you shouldn't at least try it.

Regardless, you get a great workout and learn a lot. If you keep coming back, the instructor will keep returning students separate from the new ones so that you can learn more advanced techniques. There's also a lot of partner work, so you'll for sure make some new friends. All in all, I recommend it.

Taido is a reinvention of Japanese Karate for the 21st century.

 The second part of the class could be very useful to architecture students (in my section we did a project/assignment on creating a floorplan to meet specific needs and restraints), but it would be hard to endorse taking the full class just for that part. 

The 3D part of the class focused on land development/road design applications in my section of the class. If that is something you're interested in learning it could be a mark in the pro con list.

Generally, CEE 1770 is introductory and the difficulty comes from the group project aspect and not the material covered.

comments,"Whether it is worth for you depends on if you have a choice between GT physics and other places. 

College is worth what you make it. There is good research being done here in a variety of  physics sub-disciplines and if you're an American citizen you can easily enjoy working at GTRI too. You should really take a look at the professors in the department and see if the research being done here is of interest to you. 

Physics department is pretty flexible in terms of taking courses compared to engineering, and it not uncommon for people to take graduate courses during their bachelor's degree and you can enjoy more advanced treatment of different topics. 

Still GT is generally more known for its engineering programs. If you ever decide that Physics at GT isn't worth it for you;  just add another major; just gotta sign a form and submit ( for most majors.

&gt;I know the less removed from high school you are, the more they pay attention to your high school stuff. I was rejected this January from GT as a freshman applicant, so clearly I wasn’t cutting it in high school (good academics and essays but almost zero extracurriculars), so I know that it’d be unwise to apply TOO early but when is too early?

When you apply to transfer to Tech, they don't look at your high school records at all, except dual enrollment stuff. No SAT/ACT either. It's 100% college stuff. There is a such thing as ""too early"" though. If you have less than 60 hours it gets a lot harder. Meeting the basic requirements won't get you in.

If you're **really** dead set on Tech, transfer to one of the smaller USG schools and do [REPP](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/repp). That will get you a lot closer to Tech than rolling the dice with regular admissions. I wouldn't throw away a spot at Purdue though.

Pre calc is basically not even a class here (it is but the only credit you'll get from it is for an elective) and calc 1 is a 2 hour class (at UWG it was a 4 hour class, only 2 hours transfer tho). My advisor basically gave me two options: take calc 2 and linear algebra (I've heard both are awful), or take math 1711 and 1712. 1712 is basically calc 1, and 1711 is a stats class for business majors. I personally chose to do 1711 and 1712. Both were fairly easy, especially compared to my roommate's calc 2 homework I saw him doing. If you were planning on doing ITM or supply chain, I'd recommend considering the upper level maths because apparently some of those classes are aided by prior calc knowledge. But you already said you're doing marketing, so here's what I would do if I were you: call GT's registrar office and ask them what math classes transfer over.

Some of these are friends that he probably just met for a while in highschool and don't actually have too close of a bond, so he just feels more comfortable and rewarded when talking to people from tech (who have  similar values to him).

i think you're misunderstanding what i was saying

i never said op has an obligation to learn about something they aren't interested in, i said they should make a sincere effort to be interested and engaged when talking to someone

that's what the problem here is, it's not ""liberal arts girl gets offended over everything"" like the original post says; it's ""liberal arts girl is offended because i scoff at the things that interest her""

&gt;And if you actually think manspreading, probably the most mundane thing to argue about in the feminist movement, is interesting, I can firmly say that OP and I have very different interests and values from you as well.

it just seems to me that the discussion about ""manspreading"" is a microcosm of a discussion of how we conceptualize personal space

I love talking about politics, absolutely **love** it, but I've learned that there are plenty of people who find it uncomfortable and/or aren't particularly interested in discussing it. If someone isn't interested in something, sometimes they just aren't interested, and you need to learn to respect that.

* PHYS 2212 - can be difficult and time-consuming. Relatively large volume of weekly homework.

* CS 1332 - not the *most* difficult course in the world, but certain parts still trip people up. Weekly or bi-weekly homeworks. **Go to recitation**, the TAs are spectacular.

* CS 2340 - I took it with Bob Waters (now retired), so I can't speak to how it is now. However, I'd expect weekly team project checkpoints (milestones). Don't fall behind on the coding.

So, those three alone already are going to give you weekly homework that will take up a decent amount of time. Both 2050 and 2550 (I took 2551, but I assume it's similar) will just add onto that weekly homework grind.

The registrar does allow prerequisite override permits in general, but each school will be responsible for how they choose to allow them. Typically they do not grant override permits for students who have failed the prerequisite course. 

Since you're a point away - have you tried talking to your Math 2551 professor? 

You could maybe get a permit if you agree to take the courses together, so making it a co-requisite instead of a prerequisite. 

The system will perform a check eventually by/in phase 2, and you'll get an error.

&amp;#x200B;

That is a GENERIC answer.  GT, like top-flight private schools like Harvard, has the level of name recognition and opportunities that can make the extra cost worthwhile.  If, for your specific interests, GT is significantly better than your in-state options, than you should try reaching out to the financial aid office to see what can be done.

comments,"Lots of comments saying to take around 12 credit hours here. Personally, I did 14 credits, and I wish had taken more credit hours. That would have alleviated a lot of pressure for the upcoming semesters.

That said, the only ""heavy"" class I did was 1554. Personally I think 1102 is a real heavyweight class, because the assignments may be conceptually easy, but boy are they long. Or I may just have had bad luck with the professor I got (Fitzsimmons) - a lot of the people I knew had a much easier time. 
I'd say that PHYS 2211 is going to be a heavy class, especially with lab, and it might be too much to do exclusively 3 credit hour classes. That said, it may be wise to stick with 2211 and 1554 in your first semester, because they are prereqs for many, many important classes. If you feel like you can handle the workload, it's totally possible to pull through (I did something similar my second semester) with your current schedule. Otherwise, I think it may be wiser to do one of the following:
        1. Either stick to 16-17 hours, but remove some of the 3-credit hour classes, and fill in the space with 1 and 2 credit hour ""easy A"" (well as easy as that gets at Tech) classes. That way if you perform subpar in one of your classes, you can cushion the blow on your GPA by using the easier classes. This is useful especially if your 4-year plan is looking tight on space and you need to get a few classes out of the way early. 
        2. Reduce the number of credit hours you are taking, as several answers have suggested. This will help you reduce your workload and give your more time to get accustomed to college. That said, if you lack space in your 4-year schedule, you probably don't want to do that, because chances are this will come back to get you in your senior year.",positive,0.9937,positive,0.13592436974789915,07/29/2019

comments,"My advice is probably dated (I graduated in 2015), but I do still come do career fairs at Tech for my company every now and then. I had an overall GPA of about 2.6ish and landed several internship offers as a Sophomore, then again when I was about to graduate and I got lots of actual job offers. 

If you're looking for an internship, and are early in your schooling, we understand your situation when we talk to you. We're not looking for particularly polished 2nd or 3rd year students to come be programming rock stars for us. We're looking for people that have a good work ethic, and who we feel will work well with our existing teams. 

Someone who comes to our table and can hold a productive conversation for 2 or 3 minutes about computing related stuff and who asks intelligent questions about our company, but who has a low GPA is miles ahead of someone who hands us a pristine resume and walks away without making a personal connection. 

But even if you don't get any offers, the experience gained from talking to every single company at the career fair and researching the ones who look interesting is WELL worth your time. If it makes you even 5% more comfortable the next time you talk to a recruiter then you have absolutely succeeded. In our field, in our area, from our school there is no reason for you not to get an internship or a job. The biggest thing that will hold you back is yourself, and that's not just some platitude. All it takes is for you to make a positive impression on literally ONE person either in person or on the phone for them to vouch for you and put that magic checkmark on your resume.",positive,0.9901,positive,0.20471195471195472,07/29/2019

What impresses companies more than your gpa these days is a combination of your determination and personality.

Machine Learning can be an endeavor. If nothing has changed, you'll get your project assignments a month or so in advanced—do not put it off to the last week. If the project description says steal code, then steal code—resist the urge to do things from scratch (ideally, you should learn how to, but this is not the class for that, especially if you have other project classes). Unless you know your shit going in, don't aim high; you'll be analyzing datasets of your own choosing, so choose easily analyzable shit. If it's the boring iris dataset built into scipy, so be it.

If you feel like dropping, I'd drop ML first. If anything, I actually recommend taking ML for Trading first. It actually introduces machine learning and data manipulation in Python far more gently than Machine Learning does. I feel strongly that ML is like filling a cup with a fire hose; it covers way too many disparate concepts and gives out heavy projects and exams that most learning is lost in the fracas.

Junior Design depends on your group. Don't end up doing the person doing most of the work. Talk to the professors if you do. Otherwise, it's not too bad. The first part more so than the second.

2110 wasn't bad for me at all. Others had problems, but circuits, bitwise operations, and assembly code had a compelling simplicity to them. When you get to the C project, again, don't go overboard on it unless you know what you're doing.

My roommate was not a fan of Knowledge-Based AI. IIRC, his complaints were mainly about the writings he had to do, and the vagueness of the problems I think? Don't have much data on this one.

comments,"&gt; I know that connection is everything in the game industry so I was concerned whether GaTech will have a strong networking connection to the industry.

We're getting better. In my estimation, our facilities aren't as industry tied as, perhaps, Carnegie Mellon's ETC program, but we have a lot of people interning at Hi-Rez and Cartoon Network. Unfortunately, I'm not really sure about how good the mobility is at those companies. I think the games industry is notorious for taking on interns, but not really promoting them quickly.

This year, it seems we're getting a fair bit of game or game-adjacent companies at the CoC Career Fair (Naughty Dog, Hi-Rez, Riot, Twitch, Amazon), which I think is more than previous semesters. I'm the VP of VGDev (game dev club), and we're always trying to get more games industry opportunities to our members (we're open to both undergrad and graduate students). We usually have a contingent of people go to GGDA networking events or Dreamhack, and we try to get industry people to give talks. My hope is that we can keep expanding this; I want to try and get more games-adjacent companies to come (e.g. Facebook is working on social VR applications); if the games industry continues to be a dumpster fire, I'd rather give people opportunities in industries that adequately compensate their workers.

As for deciding between Tech and CMU, I'm currently doing research at the HCII, and it's incredible. The facilities seem better than Tech's, and for Ed Tech, they just seem hard to beat. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about the HCI program at Tech to give you a better comparison (Tech needs to do a better job of making these programs visible to undergrads).",positive,0.9021,positive,0.15948275862068967,07/30/2019

comments,"Short answer: yes, it's possible sometimes. 

Long answer: As someone who has done this, it's tricky and depends on which department and professor you're working for. You'll need to talk with both to make sure you won't be exceeding part-time employment. Housing expects your RA job to be the most important thing in your life outside of academics, so you may have to work fewer hours as a TA to meet  their requirements. I did it for a semester while being a full-time student (ChBE), and it was exhausting. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're in a particularly easy semester (or a major that you have a lot of free time on your hands). Also, if this is your first semester working a job along classes, I wouldn't recommend jumping in to both at the same time.

It will ***not*** help you work abroad, like someone else mentioned.  That's a promise. With your STEM degree your minor is mostly a personal choice to have semi-expertise in a field. INTA will not be a qualifying factor for working abroad as much as language skills or your actual CV will be.

Edit: Since apparently I've angered the liberal arts students: I am not saying that it is useless knowledge. I am saying that your minor is generally going to be a personal exploit. Most minors (some exceptions) will not matter down the road, from all of my experience. If you're interested in being an engineer and doing inta, do it, but not for any advantages to your career as an engineer. Learn a language instead.

The people saying that it helps with getting an international jobs are wrong. I am in contact with recruiters in Switzerland, England, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and can 100% confirm that none of them care if you did an INTA minor, since most European universities don't have minors.

One big challenge part-time students face is that they may need to make payments while still in school. It will depend on your enrollment status and your lender.

Federal student loans: Repayment will begin if you fall below half-time status.

So if you register for 7 hours, you should be fine, federally.

Short answer to all three:
1. Yes
2. Great
3. Yes

Once you get a little higher in course level and can start focusing your study on areas of particular interest, it’s both especially challenging and satisfying coursework.

comments,"Okay! So, as a Mechanical Engineer, you know just about individual techniques but how these fit into a greater engineering process. There is a life cycle of how an engineering project progresses that has some degree of overlap between those of other engineering disciplines. It’s not a 1:1, and I’m sure it varies a great deal, but I think it is safe to say that as a Mechanical Engineer, you would have more understanding of what a Chemical Engineer has to deal with than someone who has no engineering background at all. 

Someone who studies international affairs should hopefully have a baseline understanding that the cultural and political components of different countries mean that the ways they communicate and measure value can be very different. In design, this difference manifests itself as understanding that different colors have different cultural connotations. Your design intent with a specific color may have the opposite interpretation in a different cultural context!

There are many components of people skills, of course, but one of them is acknowledging that people have different motivations and points of view that are usually out of your control. To have a greater awareness that these differences exist as part of an International Affairs background extends beyond the bounds of the specific cases studied in class. 

To use a metaphor, lifting weights helps you do more than just lift weights. Physical strength that is gained has broader application than this. Like lifting weights, the gains that are realized are highly dependent on the level of effort on the part of the student. You can passively take an elective or use it as an opportunity to broaden your perspective. 

If this feels non-specific, you’re right. It’s highly contextual to each person. It’s not as easy to measure as raw mathematical aptitude. The benefit might not be worth it to you personally, but isn’t a bit much to dismiss the value it may have for others entirely?",positive,0.9947,positive,0.1567694597069597,07/31/2019

comments,"If someone needs a minor to understand that different cultures view things differently, then they need to open up their friend group to Georgia tech's international students or travel and actually live abroad, instead of half learning about it.

As I explained briefly, if you want to work abroad, learn the language first. It's a necessary step for integration in all countries and the necessary speaking to native speakers will clue you in enough to the culture to understand values. Americans cannot understand the Swiss just because they took a class on the country. The Swiss don't care. They care if you can get the engineering job done and can interact with them like a normal human, preferably in their language.

Think of it like this. Would you trust someone who took 5 mechanical engineering classes to suddenly be able to programme the  calculations required for computational fluid dynamics and make the simulation tools necessary to read the data? Of course not. Companies barely trust anyone under a PhD to do that (I can personally confirm this). For the same reason, the pretention that Americans have that 5 classes about international affairs will clue them into day to day culture of any country is hilarious. That's why it's a separate major. Because people need 120+ credit hours to be considered as having the minimum qualification for the job.

If you need a class to explain that cultures and values differ based on geographic location, take a car ride down to Mexico. Monolinguists could go to Canada instead. Spend a month there. It'll be way more educational than anything else if you spend your time absorbing the culture and not boozing about.",positive,0.9668,positive,0.08246820052375609,07/31/2019
