comments,"Hi Víctor! If anything happens, the Office of International Education should be able to answer most of the administrative questions.

As far as food goes, the meal plans aren't really worth it, and the quality is inconsistent in the dining halls. At the same time, dining halls are one of the few places that remain open (for the most part) during weather-related emergencies, such as snow closings. The food trucks that come to campus have good food (Yumbii and Bento Bus especially), but can be somewhat expensive. Meal plan or no meal plan, Sweet Hut and Twisted Kitchen are two places in Midtown that I highly recommend. 

On-campus housing fill up pretty quickly and include the Graduate Living Center, North Avenue, and Eighth Street Apartments- you will need to email [incomingexchange@oie.gatech.edu](mailto:incomingexchange@oie.gatech.edu) if you want to live in any of those places. Another option is I-House, which has a somewhat different application process and perks (including a 3D printer).

Off-campus housing options include Square on Fifth, U-House, Home Park, and the Standard Atlanta.

comments,"I'm only half joking TBH.  
I'm likely biased given that I'm a 2nd generation alumnus who grew up hearing stories about things like drown-proofing, the four horsemen, the Ramblin' Raft Race and really clever Burdell pranks with the stealing of the T being among the most beloved traditions.

Given that, I'm aware I may not have an impartial opinion, but here are my thoughts:  

I'm 100% behind stamping out the more recent ""tradition"" of removing random T's around campus and/or at opponents' campuses for away football games.  
It was getting out of hand while I was in school and was costing a tremendous amount of money to fix.  Not only is this costly to the Institute, but it's entirely classless IMO.

That being said, in the most recent instance of stealing the actual T, old Alumni donated more than enough to cover damage costs AND cover the fines/lost tuition of the ""offender"".  
I'm 99.99% sure they'd gladly do it again (older alumni really seem to hold this tradition in high regard).  

So as long as people aren't trying to scale the tower, or anything physically dangerous like that, I'm all for it. Particularly given that maintaining the tradition would require a great deal of ingenuity and hard work (two of the biggest virtues/skills Ma Tech tries to get out of students).

TL;DR
Don't expect to change anyone's mind with that wall of text, but I really don't think the tradition should be viewed as a basic prank that boils down to senseless vandalism.",positive,0.7305,positive,0.11369841269841267,01/31/2019

Nearly all the admissions people I have heard speak have said the same two things:  
  
1) Take challenging classes that you can still get good grades in.  
  
2) Extracurricular activities are about depth, not breadth. What really matters is that you are willing to invest time in to things outside of school, (Eagle Scout is a great example of depth) as opposed to joining as many clubs as possible. Admissions will want to hear short stories about your clubs, not just see a list.

comments,"Hi! Hope you enjoy your time at Georgia Tech. One of the things I most recommend is trying to attend HackGT. It's one of the best hackathons there is, and it's sometime in October, with applications opening at the beginning of the semester.

There are many options for housing both on campus and off campus. As an exchange student, it it is probably easier to just live on campus if you can, since most off campus options are on a 1-year lease including the summer months, so you would have to pay for those months or sublease/release your room.

As for food, I would not recommend getting a full meal plan as the food is not that good and it is cheaper to cook if you can. What I do is get 50 meal swipes for the semester so that you can go to a dining hall if you are busy or tired and don't want to cook.

You mentioned that you like sailing, I believe that there is a quite active sailing club here. I do not know the details but I saw someone else posted a link to the list of club sports, you can probably find  more information there.

Your GPA looks good; keep it high and try to take a good number of AP classes (of course, only in subjects that have AP as the next level and/or you want to pursue; don't just take something for the heck of it). Your extracurriculars seem good. Just try to get really involved with something- Eagle Scout sounds like a good place to start. I was pres of my school's Speech and Debate team and invested a lot of time in that (with good results!), so I'd advise finding something you like and are passionate about and getting really good at it! It doesn't even have to be STEM; I had absolutely 0 CS experience before college. Let me know if you have any other questions!",positive,0.9825,positive,0.3772115384615385,02/01/2019

Integration and collocation - view and manage several accounts from a single location rather than jumping between apps. Think banking, social media, news, etc - you have several providers for each of these, but a similar goal when using them.  For example, single ""banking"" app could be more efficient for managing your finances than one from each bank you use. 

Conversational and context aware assistants - the current generation of personal assistant tech is focused on simple commands or command sequences.  In the future, a more unstructured, human-like interaction will make them much easier to use. They will likely see increased integration with apps or service providers as well. 

Increased acceptance and proliferation of digital wallets - these will likely replace credit/debit cards at some point.  The bottleneck is not with the software but with more places accepting them and fragmentation (similar to places only taking Visa or MasterCard).

comments,"2.  It doesn't have to be hard to get rec letters, professors like Fekri seem to be open to writing you rec letters if you regularly participate in class and perform well on exams. If you don't regularly attend class getting a good letter of rec (if any) will be harder. Clearly, some professors are more open to writing letters than others so I would be cognizant of that when asking for one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't really speak to your first question cause I haven't yet had to ask a professor to be my research advisor. There are lots of cool labs on campus in perception and ML so there are decent odds of being able to work in one of these labs. I would say cast a wide net by sending a lot of emails. Taking a class with a professor and performing exceptionally well in that class is a good foot in the door for joining their lab. 

Either way, if you want to go into academia as you said then it's in your best interests to really pursue doing research (whether that's here or at southern illinois).

We had a great conversation about the allocation of spaces and furniture choice, among other topics. As a result of the meeting we are exploring visual barriers for study spaces throughout Price Gilbert, which will open in late 2019 or early 2020. We can’t promise full carrels like what existed before (mostly because they take up so much room and we need to be able to fit more students in the spaces to account for enrollment growth), but we will definitely make sure there exists options for learners who prefer a less-active study experience. We are also exploring options for making the third and fourth floors of both buildings quiet floors, in addition to six and seven. This might include silence, or some sort of “noise-gradient “system we maintain on the floors through signage and rovers.
 
Essentially, the third and fourth floors of both Price Gilbert and Crosland will be multimedia spaces – but the interactive/classroom spaces are enclosed. You can see this already on 3 and 4 in Crosland: The Multimedia Studio and Data Viz lab are enclosed, and the rest of the floor has computers and carrels. That means we can use the remaining space on both floors for quiet study. As we finish up the whole project and reconfigure study spaces/furniture throughout the complex – please know what exists in the building right now is in no way the finished product – we hope to achieve something closer to the balance requested.
 
To help with students who want a bit more privacy in the sixth-floor study areas, we’re moving white boards up. Angell suggested this as a no-cost solution many students use in Clough, and we agreed it was a step in the right direction.

comments,"Our CATV headend combines feeds from over-the-air broadcast and satellite channels. Some of the OTA channels, WGCL 46 (CBS) included, are broadcast from a tower in Midtown. Directly in the path between our headend in the Rich Building and that tower is the NCR building. Since it was built, signal issues have occurred on many of our OTA channels.

The CATV headend team fought with that signal issue for a while but we ended up recently (in the last few months) moving 4.13 and 5.13 to satellite receivers. This should eliminate any of the previous signal dropouts that people experienced. Some people may not receive 4.13/5.13 right now if they haven't done a channel scan since the change occurred. But running a channel scan should make the channels come back, barring any issues outside of the headend (e.g. bad coax cable, incompatible TV, low signal in the room, etc).",negative,-0.775,positive,0.07646520146520146,02/03/2019

comments,"I don’t think op is saying that he’s above everyone else and he’s not really saying that if you need help to really suck it up. He’s saying that for the people with the effort and energy to complain, why don’t they use their time to help others that need the help? It lends to the argument that mental facilities can only do so much to help you. They can’t come to you and say you need help, we’re going to help you. Mankind simply hasn’t mastered the art of mind reading just yet. This is a school, it’s stresful, people have committed suicide, but what have we as students as a whole done other than complain that Tech needs to spend more money on health facilities? 

The mental facility phase is treatment but what about prevention? How are we and Tech preventing mental health issues? Some of the factors are out of our control such as life at home and outside of Tech, but we can still create a more inclusive community. Whether you like it or not, it’s difficult to make meaningful friendships if you’re an introverted individual and Tech is famous for them. Doesn’t the argument also go, if the community as a whole became more inclusive, wouldn’t that lower stress and issues associated with mental instability? Why can’t we even our part while expecting Tech to take care of everything?

And I mentioned this in another post but I’ll say t again, if you really need help, there are a hella lot of resources available. We’re in Atlanta for Pete’s sake and Emory hospital is literally within a bus ride or even biking distance. There are places you can go that you can get a faster appointment, but everyone is overloading STAMPS. If it boils down to cost, you only paid so much for the medical fee. The sum may seem large but in comparison to what Tech has to provide with flu shots, examinations, psychiatry, emergency services, and whatever else they spend the money on, is that really a large sum? Can you really expect them to have the state of art mental facility?

Just food for thought. I considered suicide multiple times before too, but I still made it. I sought refuge in my friends and family and they were accepting, welcoming, and caring. For me, it was just needing someone to talk to for me to vent about life and speak of my worries. I’ve gone to a psychiatrist once and while it did make me feel better, it was nothing compared to what my friends and family did for me. ",positive,0.9656,positive,0.11317693744164335,02/06/2019

Also, this is a key point when asking someone for a LoR: never ask ""can you write me a LoR?"" because they may feel put on the spot, and if they write you a weak LoR, this may hurt you more than it will help you. Instead, phrase the question as ""do you feel comfortable writing me a strong LoR?"" If they know you well and feel they can really help in your application, they will agree. Otherwise, they will candidly let you know that you need to find someone else.

comments,"Bruh this is insane, next time u rant like this pls do some cursory research. 

People can be vegan for several reasons, but for me it’s about the environment. Animal agriculture is the largest consumer of water on the planet. There are humans that don’t have clean water to drink. 
It takes 2,400 gallons of water to raise ONE POUND of beef. Conversely it takes only 25 gallons of water to produce 1 lb of wheat, which goes farther nutrition wise too.

Aside from water usage, there’s the huge issue of water pollution. Americans especially eat A LOT of meat, and in America alone livestock produce 89,000 lbs of excrement per second. This is an insane amount of waste, and leaches into the water system that we all rely on. A conservative estimate states that 35,000 miles of rivers in the US alone have been polluted by animal excrement. 

In addition to that there’s the insane amount of CO2 and methane emissions that are a product of animal agriculture. if every American dropped one meal with chicken in it from their diet per WEEK, it would save the same amount of CO2 emissions as taking 500,000 cars of the road. That’s one small change most of us can make that has an incredible impact. The meat industry is the single largest contributor of methane gas production in the world, a gas that is 20x more powerful than CO2 at trapping heat within the atmosphere.

Then, there’s the land usage that goes into animal agriculture. Raising animals uses 30% of earths land mass. That’s a huge proportion.  More than 260 million acres of US forests have been cleared to create farmland for grain for livestock to be grown. That is extremely unnecessary. The amount of land cleared to feed the population of the United States with crops is substantially less. Livestock grazing is the #1 reason for plant Species extinction in the US.

I don’t know about you, but I don’t know what state our earth is going to be in in the next few decades. As a tech student, I assume you respect science, and understand that the scientific studies warning about the irreversible dangers of climate change are real. I’m afraid of what the world will be like as I age, I am uncertain about my future, and if not eating animal products is my part in a better future then it’s an easy change.

In order to use a different SIM card, you have to make sure the phone is unlocked. AT&amp;T (my carrier as well) won't give you an unlock code unless you have totally paid the phone off, but you can buy unlock codes from other (usually sketchy looking) places.

One lesson learned- the first time i did this T-mobile asked if I want the credit pull option or no credit pull. Though I have great credit i know the pull is a ding so I opted for the later. That was a mistake as that did not include the international plan - though the local salesperson told me it did. Was a mess to fix. Go with the option where they run your credit.

You need to actually go read what a CLERY is and what a GTENS is. There’s no federal or state law about notifying you every time there’s a crime you consider bad. CLERY is very specific and is mandated federally and GTENS can include different things like weather or an ongoing situation. 

GTPD said the car headed away from campus and onto the damn interstate... they said they confirmed that through cameras. BAM.. if you knew what GTENS or CLERY was then you’d know based on that... neither one is needed or mandatory.

comments,"I know that /u/GaTechPD has already answered some of these questions, but thought we would jump in since you asked specifically about GTENS.  Also, we'll be doing an AMA soon to answer questions like these, questions about campus closures, etc.  Look for an announcement soon.

* The federal law you are referencing is the Clery Act.  Among (many) other things, the law says that we (Institutions of Higher Education) have responsibilities to:
   * Issue ***Timely Warnings (Clery Alert)*** for certain types of crime that fall within our Clery Alert Boundary.  
      * We (GTPD) makes a determination if the incident meets the criteria for issuing the warning, AKA ""Clery Alert"":
      * Did the event occur within our predesignated Clery Boundary?
      * Does this present an ongoing threat to the campus community?
   * Send ***Emergency Notifications (GTENS)*** for imminent threats that require immediate action.
      * At Georgia Tech these are GTENS alerts and are delivered by phone, email, text, LiveSafe, Digital Signage, Social Media and the Siren Warning System.
      * These may include tornado warnings, active shooter incidents, or other threats that GTPD deems an imminent threat to the campus.
* Regarding the examples you provided, here is some background justification on why Clery Alerts were not sent:
   * For the robbery involving GT students off campus, the robbery was (1) outside of our boundary and (2) did not present an ongoing threat to our community.  Our decision not to issue a Clery Alert did not have anything to do with our jurisdiction vs. Atlanta Police's jurisdiction.  Much of our Clery Boundary is technically *within* APD's primary jurisdiction.  To be clear, many of the alerts we send are for off-campus incidents within our boundary that ultimately APD handles.  
   * For the recent shooting near the Varsity in Midtown, the incident did fall within the boundary.  Without any context, it could warrant a Clery Alert, if not a GTENS Alert.  **But the context is important.**  As /u/GaTechPD stated, our officers quickly reviewed the incident, using our many cameras and resources and determined that the suspect in this incident did not come onto or towards campus. Further, they quickly determined with APD that it would not present an ongoing threat to our campus.

Keep in mind that while most all schools are compliant with the Clery Act, there is some level of discretion that schools can apply.  As such, you may find experiences slightly different from one campus to another.

&amp;#x200B;

We do answer questions like these frequently, but both we and /u/GaTechPD are always happy to do so.

Memorizing the general form for a voltage divider is useful, and remember you can replace resistors in equations with impedances and create transfer functions that way.   


From what I've heard of Yoder's 2040 class (and my experience with his 3040 class), it may be useful to remember solutions to 1st and 2nd order ODEs. If there's anything in particular you seem to be struggling with, feel free to comment on that and I can see if there are any suggestions I can think of for studying or intuitive problem solving..

comments,"Ah yes, nodes definitely help! As a sanity check at the end of your analyses you could always try to trace the circuit logically--since you would expect current to flow to a lower potential, you could go back and look at those signs with that in mind. But I've always found doing nodal analysis in the same way for every path helps account for those sign changes, i.e. like [this](https://images.slideplayer.com/17/5288912/slides/slide_14.jpg) where you assume at every node, current is entering the node. I think with practice of these analysis techniques (like mesh current analysis or node analysis), those mistakes will occur much less frequently.

Emailing sucks for some people, but we is in the 21st century and like it or not, people email more and more.  Its never too late to start getting used to emailing people.  The more you do it the easier it gets and then you will start working out the kinks in your email writing style.  

Anyways, if you cannot make office hours, you should really email the professor and state this, and sometimes NOT ALWAYS, they will actually change their office hours.  It never hurts to ask, just don't ask too often where it becomes what you are known for. 

Another thing to look out for is that they might have different office hours for a different class that they teach.  That is, if they are teaching two courses in once semester.  Its not uncommon for professors to teach an undergrad course and an grad course.  you can always sneak into the grad office hours and ask your questions then.

Not really the professors fault... it's up to you to show up to class and find a way to connect with the material or at least be present. 

If not, consider whether the class is doing any good for you and if you should skip it in order to do some self study (obviously not if it's attendance or group based, etc).

That's nice. Won't happen all the time. If this is the first time you're running into an incoherent professor, that's pretty impressive. Primarily professors are here for research, they teach as a condition of their employment. I'd say easily half aren't very good at the teaching part, which is where the responsibility lies on you to adapt around it. Do what you need to do to understand the material (read the book, form a study group, etc) and pass your exams so you can pass the class. Whether you find it overall enjoyable or engaging material versus bland is pretty irrelevant. I assume it's a course you need to graduate, so. Is any of this fair or a good way to do it? Of course not, I agree with you on that. But it is what it is, and you need to figure out a way to get through it. Or you can lodge an academic grievance but I don't think that would go very far. 

&gt; bottom-line I prefer my tuition not be put toward ineffectual teaching methods and assistants. Don't really see how that's disagreeable tbh.

Again, I fully agree. But you're not owed a refund over it. It's not ""I'll pay the admission fee afterwards if I felt I enjoyed the course"", it's ""I paid the admission fee up front so the registrar would allow me to be in the course"". ",positive,0.144,positive,0.24803030303030305,02/08/2019

Yeah, unfortunately. Do what you need to do now to pass the course, that's got to be your primary objective. If you're able to influence it's administration, that's also good, but a lot of times at Tech it's a matter of what do I need to do to pass this now, the way that it is. I respect your work ethic and wanting to actually learn - don't let that go! It's still interesting to me that this is the first time you've encountered this at Tech lol. Seemed like it was an every day occurrence for myself and my friends while I was there. 

As far as grievance procedure: 

Students should first discuss any concerns with the relevant faculty member; if it is not possible to come to resolution with the faculty member, students may then report the matter to the appropriate administrator (Chair or Associate Chair or Director of Studies) of the department of instruction

I try to acknowledge them all, but if you wrote me a form email with no context, I'll probably reply with an email that required a similar amount of thought. My favorites are the ones that say ""I am interested in your research in CUT AND PASTE ARTICLE TITLE AND EVEN USE A DIFFERENT FONT WHEN YOU PASTED"". And if I ask another faculty member, they received the same email, with a different cut and pasted article.

So yes -- be personal, be honest, say what you want to put into it and what you expect to get out of it. I don't expect an undergrad to know anything about my research, but I do expect that they have some skills they can apply to it -- and they may not even know it!  I will usually ask ""what have been your favorite classes, and why?"" and ""what kind of projects, clubs, or past research have you worked on?""

In one case, Panasonic hired a foreign official as a consultant while the official was simultaneously negotiating a contract between the company and a government-owned airline.

The official was paid $875,000 over six years, despite doing ""little work,"" according to documents.

The case has prompted internal changes at Panasonic, including ""appointing a new management team and substantially reducing, and enhancing controls around, the use of third-party agents and consultants,"" the company said in a statement

* It only applies to public colleges/universities

* You must be 21+ with a weapons license to do it

* Firearms are still banned in athletic facilities, student housing (including Greek houses), faculty offices, offices where disciplinary proceedings are held, spaces where classes are held for high school students (incl dual-enrollment)

* Firearms are supposed to be concealed

comments,"I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice, but I have done a lot of research into this subject. Here's an overview with links to authoritative resources that you can consult for yourself:

Yes, in the State of Georgia, you can generally carry a concealed^(1) handgun^(2) on most^(3) parts of public university^(4) campuses, if you are:

**(1) A person with a valid Georgia Weapons Carry License****^(5)****; or**

**(2) A non-resident of Georgia with a valid concealed carry license from a reciprocal state****^(6)****.**

&amp;#x200B;

**^(1)** ""*'Concealed' means carried in such a fashion that does not actively solicit the attention of others and is not prominently, openly, and intentionally displayed except for purposes of defense of self or others. Such term shall include, but not be limited to, carrying on one's person while such handgun is substantially, but not necessarily completely, covered by an article of clothing which is worn by such person, carrying within a bag of a nondescript nature which is being carried about by such person, or carrying in any other fashion as to not be clearly discernible by the passive observation of others.*"" *See* [*O.C.G.A. § 16-11-127.1(c)(20)*](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2017/title-16/chapter-11/article-4/part-3/section-16-11-127.1/)*.*

&amp;#x200B;

**^(2)** ""'*Handgun' means a firearm of any description, loaded or unloaded, from which any shot, bullet, or other missile can be discharged by an action of an explosive where the length of the barrel, not including any revolving, detachable, or magazine breech, does not exceed 12 inches; provided, however, that the term ""handgun"" shall not include a gun which discharges a single shot of .46 centimeters or less in diameter.*"" *See* [*O.C.G.A. § 16-11-125.1(1)*](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2017/title-16/chapter-11/article-4/part-3/section-16-11-125.1/)*.*

&amp;#x200B;

**^(3)** You cannot carry a concealed handgun in:

(1) buildings and property used for athletic sporting events;

(2) student housing, including fraternities and sororities that are on school property^(7);

(3) preschool or childcare spaces;

(4) rooms and other spaces during the times when they are being used for classes in which high school students are enrolled, including dual enrollment^(8);

(5) faculty, staff, or administrative offices; or

(6) rooms where disciplinary proceedings are being conducted.

*See* [*Official Guidance from the University System of Georgia*](https://www.usg.edu/assets/usg/docs/USG_HB_280_Guidance_%28003%29.pdf)*,* [*O.C.G.A. § 16-11-127.1(c)(20)*](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2017/title-16/chapter-11/article-4/part-3/section-16-11-127.1/)*.*

&amp;#x200B;

**^(4)** The campus carry statute applies to ""*any public technical school, vocational school, college, or university, or other public institution of postsecondary education.*"" *See* [*O.C.G.A. § 16-11-127.1(c)(20)*](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2017/title-16/chapter-11/article-4/part-3/section-16-11-127.1/)*.* You cannot bring a gun to other schools or private universities, such as Emory University.

&amp;#x200B;

**^(5)** The issuance criteria is defined in [O.C.G.A. § 16-11-129](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2017/title-16/chapter-11/article-4/part-3/section-16-11-129/). Age-wise, you have to be (a) 21+ years old, or (b) 18+ years old if you have ""completed basic training in the armed forces of the United States"" and ""actively serving in the armed forces of the United States or has been honorably discharged from such service.""

&amp;#x200B;

**^(6)** If you are not a resident of Georgia, you can carry a handgun in Georgia if you have a concealed carry license from one of these states: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri , Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. *See* [*Georgia Attorney General's Website*](https://law.georgia.gov/firearms-license-reciprocity)*,* [*O.C.G.A. § 16-11-126(e)(1)(A)*](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2017/title-16/chapter-11/article-4/part-3/section-16-11-126/).

The license does not have to be issued by your home state; it can be from a state that offers licenses to non-residents. *See* [*Letter 1 from the Assistant Attorney General of Georgia*](https://georgiafirearmreciprocity.github.io/20180711_Georgia_North_Carolina_Reciprocity.pdf)*,* [*Letter 2 from the Assistant Attorney General of Georgia*](https://georgiafirearmreciprocity.github.io/20170607_Georgia_New_Hampshire_Reciprocity.pdf)*.*

You do not have to be 21 years old. For example, Georgia recognizes the Utah Provisional Concealed Firearm Permit. *See* [*Letter 3 from the Assistant Attorney General of Georgia*](https://georgiafirearmreciprocity.github.io/20170502_Georgia_Utah_Reciprocity.pdf)*,* [*Letter 4 from the Assistant Attorney General of Georgia*](https://georgiafirearmreciprocity.github.io/20121116_Georgia_New_Hampshire_Reciprocity.pdf)*.*

For more information about the validity of non-resident licenses and under-21 licenses, see my [dedicated website for this subject](https://georgiafirearmreciprocity.github.io/).

&amp;#x200B;

**^(7)** Georgia's school campus safety zone is defined as:

""*Any real property or building owned by or leased to:*

*(A) Any public or private elementary school, secondary school, or local board of education and used for elementary or secondary education; and*

*(B) Any public or private technical school, vocational school, college, university, or other institution of postsecondary education.*"" *See* [*O.C.G.A. § 16-11-127.1(a)(3)*](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2017/title-16/chapter-11/article-4/part-3/section-16-11-127.1/)*.*

Thus, if a Georgia Tech fraternity or sorority is on property that is neither owned by or leased to Georgia Tech, it is not limited by the campus carry law, and you may be able to carry there. However, private property owners always have the right to make you leave their property. This is a helpful tool for checking who owns a particular piece of property: [http://www.fultoncountyga.gov/fcgis-property-profile](http://www.fultoncountyga.gov/fcgis-property-profile). There is also an approximate map here: [http://www.s1.realestate.gatech.edu/property](http://www.s1.realestate.gatech.edu/property).

&amp;#x200B;

^(8) ""*License-holders who want to carry handguns to class will need to visit the institution’s registrar or other designated employee, who after verifying their enrollment status will tell them which of their classes, if any, have high school students enrolled. Institutions shall not, however, keep any listing of those who inquire.*"" *See* [*Official Guidance from the University System of Georgia*](https://www.usg.edu/assets/usg/docs/USG_HB_280_Guidance_%28003%29.pdf)*.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Georgia Tech Police also has a page with more information, here:** [**http://police.gatech.edu/campuscarry**](http://police.gatech.edu/campuscarry)**.**

**The Board of Regents (which runs Georgia Tech) has official guidance, here:** [**https://www.usg.edu/assets/usg/docs/USG\_HB\_280\_Guidance\_%28003%29.pdf**](https://www.usg.edu/assets/usg/docs/USG_HB_280_Guidance_%28003%29.pdf)**.**

You get hit in the side making a turn on a bike, maybe the end of your days.

If there are a bunch of people on a crosswalk, get off an walk your bike. If no one is there, just be mindful and don't race. In general, if you are not being a danger to pedestrians, you won't have to worry about getting in trouble.

One thing is certain, if you are crossing a heavily used crosswalk THAT IS ON CAMPUS (like in front of Barnes and Nobles). Walk your bike. People have gotten a ticket there a few times.

Most of what I am saying has nothing to do with the law. Sorry if that makes this a shitpost. It is just that the law is not really the end-all.

Firstly, I personally don’t know a lot of professors that are so reasonable in terms of due dates; I know a lot of students appreciate that you are flexible. Secondly, obviously you care and I respect that immensely. I genuinely think you are extremely capable of lecturing well, but here a few things that can be mitigated. It seems like we get bogged down in unnecessary details sort of frequently, but I recognize that the material can be sort of like that so I think a good way to fix this could be to focus more on high level reasoning/abstraction, breaking down the algorithms, and representing that as code.  Possibly having some sort of visual representation of some of these algorithms on a worksheet would be helpful. It’ll be interesting to see what’s on this midterm; hopefully we can at least have a topic list released? There has been a lot of material covered in the chapters and I’m not really sure what’s relevant and what isn’t.

Though one comment I could make is that each of the lectures don't really have a ""punchline"" per se. In 3511, Merrick does a good job of taking a few minutes at the end to deliver sort of a punchline to really contextualize the material and provoke some thought about how that lecture in particular fits into the overall big picture - algorithms.

I did enjoy the practicality aspect of using a roomba to visualize the previous lectures, but without an occasional reference back to how the Bellman equation relates back to the big picture, it feels more like an isolated equation we just have to know for the exam.

Those are just my thoughts about the lectures thus far, and I may be missing a few things because I've missed a few days due to mental health reasons, but yeah. ",positive,0.8222,positive,0.09366666666666663,02/09/2019

The class had a relaxed grading scheme but the amount of work was non-negligible.

I believe there were 3 homeworks and a project. Each homework was a Jupyter notebook that you filled with the necessary pieces of functionality to simulate + plot some phenomena. 

As for the final project, you chose whatever you were interested in and used tools that were suggested/listed by the professor to create a simulation.

You do join a meal plan with them while retaining a smaller GT meal plan (assuming you're in an FE dorm).

This school is an overall majority engineering/CS school, likewise the greek scene is similar. My fraternity is 90% engineering/CS. 

Obligations to a fraternity as a brother are essentially a 2hr credit, and as an Associative Member like a 4hr lab class. 

You wont get into a house as an AM, and if you are initiated, likely not till your 2nd or 3rd year. 

Every year it feeks like IFC changes things, keep checking the IFC website for when they release the schedule but itll be the the Thur before classes start that rush starts. 


As per your family, there are a ton of reasons to join a fraternity, from larger average GPAs, a far lower drop out rate, the fact that you can likely save money if you can like in the house, etc. These are also posted on the IFC page.

It's like 50% engineering in most frats probably (if you include CS it's more like 80%). It's doable, but if you're planning on pledging at the fall I wouldn't go too far past the 12 credit hour minimum.

&gt; As a freshman would I just live in a dorm and eventually move to the frat house, or start living there immediately

As a freshman, you sign a housing contract (assuming you do Freshman Experience) which you can't get out of. If you want to move into a frat house you'll have to keep paying for your dorm. Also, getting a room depends on the frat a lot. I know some chapters prioritize rooms for younger members so it could be possible, but unless they have a big house with extra space it might be a while till you get to move in.

The bang for your buck of Tech apartments is very bad compared to similarly priced off-campus options (which are still expensive, but a better value). You'll be paying more than you currently are in Home Park, though.

Since it sounds like you're looking to live within walking distance of campus, the most popular options are UH, SQ5, and The Standard in Midtown. UH will be most comparably priced to Tech housing, and SQ5 will typically be two or three hundred more. The Standard appears to not be publishing pricing online for the upcoming year, which isn't surprising as the building is brand new and they're likely jacking prices for their second year, now that the promotional first year pricing is up.

All three will allow you to sign a per-room lease where they find roommates for you if you don't already have any preferences.",positive,0.9192,positive,0.17044733044733046,02/09/2019

Also, you have a better chance of undergraduate admissions as a transfer student particularly during Spring and Summer semesters.
(Of course, the fact that you Co-op with GTRI and are already on campus may reasonably guarantee admission already?)

(Go to: Admissions-&gt;Transfer Admissions) 


Maybe not the information you were looking for, but I transferred here from in-state and am very glad I did. The quality of classes is much better.

If you do need to take out loans, each semesters you can receive a subsidized loan by submitting your FAFSA.
Also there have been $1000 grants for students the last two semesters (not something to count on though).

Do you have HOPE scholarship? If you do not have it coming out of HS, it is possible to receive it after a number of credit hours with a specific GPA.

HOPE and Subsidized Loan should cover all of tuition.

Ex: asking for age and gender is generally a no-no except to verify that you're over 18. And frankly, scammers look for easier marks and wouldn't go through this much effort for so little, would pretend to be a more recognizable company etc.

If they were asking for social security #, date of birth etc. or for some kind of application fee or such I would be more suspicious.  All they've asked for so far is the kind of stuff generally posted on resumes anyway.

Depending on the role the lack of an online posting is not necessarily indicative of much, especially if they're looking for something specific or don't want to telegraph that they're hiring a lot of people in XX roles in XX city.

comments,"Disclaimer: my opinion, feel free to disagree. 

As a former fraternity member, I say just skip it. It's an antiquated system built on exclusion and privilege and any benefit offered by these clubs can be obtained by the other 400+ organizations on campus that don't ask for a hefty check every semester.

I loved all the guys in my fraternity. Great great guys that were involved in the community, studious, and always willing to help a brother. But at the end of the day, I can't recommend it for these reasons:

1) the ""GPA inflation"" of a Greek member is not because there is something special about a fraternity it's just that there is a resource of people to study with, get old tests and homework from, and an accountability system to do well. There are plenty of other organizations that offer those resources and you can always use your classmates as study buddies.

2) You're never going to ""save money"" being in a fraternity. You can find cheaper housing and food right off campus and again not spend that extra 2-3k a year on dues.

3) it's inherently exclusive that prevents you from expanding your circle of close friends. You're locked into that group that self selects new members as a group.

4) the division between different houses and Greek vs non-greek is subtle but pervasive. You'll only hang out with members of only a few of the 30+ fraternities on campus and which houses will be based on a historical culture that you are just stepping into.

5) Constructive harmony between the houses is a fools errend anyway because the existence of the club is based on a separateness of the other clubs. They're all built on the same structure, it's not like they have wildly different mission statements, so there's no real benefit in collaborating beyond a 'let's put both our names on this' charity event.

I'm not saying that you won't have an overall positive experience if you decide to go Greek or that you'll only have friends in fraternities, but I am saying you're not experiencing anything worthwhile that you can't get somewhere else.

And personally, I just grew to have too many fundamental issues with the structure of Greek life to participate any more.",positive,0.979,positive,0.13376941685765215,02/10/2019

comments,"I’m a current business major and have found that Scheller is absolutely amazing when it comes to getting a job/internship. I switched from the College of Sciences, but I’m friends with a lot of IE majors. It seems that IE is much more focused on the mathematics aspect of things while business is very conceptual and teaches you how to use programs that will do the math for you. 
Part of why I switched to business over IE is that you can also choose a concentration in the business school but not kill yourself working all the time to try to pass your classes. I have a lot of free time which means I’ve been able to get extremely involved on campus and this has helped me a LOT when it comes to jobs. We have advisors and a class specifically to help students get jobs, which is part of why our job placement rate is 97%. IE is also very high in that regard, though I can’t speak for specific numbers. The starting salaries for both aren’t that different if you take things like job locations and bonuses into account if that’s something you care a lot about. 
In the end, I can’t tell you what the best decision for you to make is, but I’m happy to answer any questions you have about Scheller. I absolutely love being a business major and have yet to meet a person that doesn’t love it. A ton of people I know have switched to business, and there’s definitely a reason for it.

If you are already certain you know who you are and the type of people you like hanging out with, by all means, join first semester. But if you're not quite sure who you are going to be in college and the type of people you want to surround yourself with, wait a semester or two. You won't miss out on much by joining Spring or Sophomore Fall, and you just might have a far better time because you know exactly who you want to surround yourself with.",positive,0.6954,positive,0.2517857142857143,02/11/2019

Her phone number is 404-931-8560- you can text her and let her know if something like this occurs. Even if you don't have something like this, you can text her with feedback and suggestions for the dining halls as well. If you aren't comfortable reaching out individually, send a message our way and I'd be happy to reach out on your behalf!

If accommodations are the only thing you are concerned about I would feel pretty confident saying you would have an easier time at Emory (but reach out to their office before transferring). That being said, academically (especially for undergrad) Tech is better for biology imo.

comments,"I've been toying with how to reply to this since it was posted. There were 3 people who voted against this bill due to the same reasons you gave. Many representatives voted yes due to a Technique article that was brought up regarding this issue as well as personal surveys that they did with constituents to garner their opinions.

If you're interested in seeing more of the discussion that went on regarding this bill, it's contained in these documents:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SwOjljxKM0B54DKVshd3RgpdVw5b\_vEUbTW3ScxxkU8/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SwOjljxKM0B54DKVshd3RgpdVw5b_vEUbTW3ScxxkU8/mobilebasic)

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R8zLC1zv71jsZp8rbi-GwTwzvllx6kgBb\_RWR0\_333E/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R8zLC1zv71jsZp8rbi-GwTwzvllx6kgBb_RWR0_333E/edit)

Please note that the above documents are typed up by a secretary during our meetings, so there may be sections that are incomplete or slightly off (e.g. some rep last names are spelled wrong, some sentences aren't complete). If you would like, I can try to get access to the video recordings from those nights and type up a more comprehensive/exact document with what was said.

Also note that this bill was amended and these changes are not reflected on the website. It now pertains to both recreational and medical marijuana. In the case that a bill is proposed in the GA State legislature regarding medical marijuana, we will express support for medical marijuana. Similarly, if something regarding recreational marijuana is proposed, we will express support for that. If nothing is proposed, nothing will be said on SGA's part from what I am aware.

Speaking on a personal basis, I completely agree with everything here regarding lack of surveying/collecting data. This bill is part of why I've started doing weekly posts regarding what bills are on the agenda for a meeting. Some reps send out emails to garner student opinion, but response rates are generally very low on those and not all reps have access to the mailing lists for their constituencies at this time.

If anyone has suggestions for ways we can get students to actually respond to polls and communicate with reps, please feel free to throw them out! Since the beginning of the year, we've only had one person come to UHR meetings to express an opinion during Open Forum that I can recall. This includes representatives speaking on behalf of constituents who reached out to them regarding concerns as well. If there's something you'd like to be expressed to the House, whether it's telling them they should be doing more surveys of constituents, expressing support/lack of support for a bill, or bringing up issues on campus that you think should be changed, let me know and I would be happy to bring it up on your behalf if you can't make it to Open Forum. We'd love to see greater interaction between the student body and the reps, and I see no reason that shouldn't be happening already.

Obviously, Tech isn't really geared towards the sciences, since it's an engineering school. The biology 1510 class I was in last semester wasn't bad, I guess, but the organization of the labs are terrible. It's not per se a difficult major. I had two friends who graduated in 3.5 years with &gt;3.5 GPAs so I guess it may be considered one of the easier majors at Tech. Then again, it's Tech, so I guess that doesn't mean ""easy"". Do you have to be super interested in it? Yeah. I found that I wasn't after taking the intro bio class but I've heard it gets a lot more fun as you get further into the major specific classes.

The Biology track has pre-med built into it, so if you want to do med school or anything similar, you're good to go. Also the advisors are also really nice, although I found them sort of unhelpful at times, but they're definitely ready to help.

I watched some of them destroy their lives with it, as surely and totally as alcohol did to some others I knew. Would argue that weed is actually more dangerous in our era, as the disease of alcoholism is well-known and understood – we don't have any good longitudinal studies on the effects of marijuana and the little data we do suggests it altars the brain's natural structure over time. Marijuana addiction, while not physiological in the way that alcohol is, certainly exists as a psychological phenomena, and we don't do much at all to warn young people of the *real* dangers of weed, beyond the hokey garbage about ""Reefer Madness."" We need to be having a mature, thoughtful discussion about weed on a national level, but instead, we're either claiming that it's satan's anus, or that it's completely harmless; both these claims are dangerous lies. 

Don't know if I'm totally against legalization, but I sure as shit don't think that we should be rushing into this without more scientific data. We should start by **really** educating students about weed and its real shortcomings, not the DrugFree crap (I assume) they still teach in high school.

Are you sure that's not exaggerating a little bit?  Scheduling noisy and disruptive work (such as jack hammering) for ""after-hours"" is a standard practice in the construction industry.  I don't see how 2 weeks worth of premium labor would ""blow the budget apart"".  It would be a small premium in the overall budget of the project.

We're sent the agenda Tuesday morning and I have 2 meetings weekly as well as class to work around. I can ask around and if this seems like something that a lot of people want I can try to find another SGA Rep who has the time in their schedule to create those!

TL;DR at bottom.

Sodexo appears to be claiming that there's some favoritism / nepotism happening here by the officials at Tech that arranged the deal with Aramark. Didn't look too much into what scandal they're referencing, but apparently there were two individuals (""Strouts and Lunsway"") that were found to have dealt ""inappropriately with vendors"" by an internal *Georgia Tech* investigation. From reading the investigation, this ""inappropriateness"" primarily involved three things:

- going to golf outings on company time with Sodexo and Aramark employees
- covering up the golf outings and incorrectly reporting this as ""time off""
- using $35,000 of GT bookstore funds to rent a football suite, most of the time for vendors and Strouts' friends

These two people were fired, but not before they arranged Aramark to be the next Tech food vendor. (Strouts was VP of campus services at the time)

So when Tech announced the deal with Aramark, Sodexo filed an Open Records Request to get all emails and texts with the word ""Sodexo"" used in any official communication - probably to find any evidence of favoritism or other legal issues to this contract.

I've dealt with the legal office at Tech before when I had to request some records in order to defend myself against a false accusation by a faculty member. They're not super helpful, but they do have to follow the law here - the Georgia Open Records Act states that *anyone* can request *any* official records from Tech (with a few exceptions), and Tech has to comply within a certain timeframe. (In my case, the legal office at Tech was ""unable to find any records"" associated with the incident of the faculty member that was accusing me, which was a pretty huge defense for my case)

**TL;DR: It seems that Tech *may have* hidden some records relating to their choice of Aramark from Sodexo, Sodexo knows it, and is now suing Tech because of this.**

comments,"Don't worry.  Seriously.  Even if you committed an Academic Honor Code violation and get convicted, it is not a big deal if you are a first time offender.  If you *did* cheat, and, especially if you get convicted, do **not** do it again, as, morality aside, you will then be risking suspension.  As it seems that you are an undergraduate early in your academic career, not only are you being unfair to your classmates if you did cheat, but, from a selfish perspective, you are going to be potentially limiting your ability to perform well in higher level courses which build upon the knowledge you are allegedly acquiring in your current course.

Now that the preachy portion is out of the way:  to actually get convicted by OSI requires quite a fair amount of effort on the part of the administration.  Even if your teacher harbours a personal vendetta against you, or, if you actually committed this offense and are lying about it, remember that your case will be heard by a mix of students and faculty.  Your peers and TAs (who may very well be your peers) often have better bullshit detectors than faculty, so it may behoove you to not make things worse if you slipped up.  Students and faculty alike do not appreciate being directly lied towards, especially in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  Now, if there is obvious prosecutorial overreach on the part of the administration, especially if their case is flimsy (such as if you actually are innocent as you state here), then arriving at a conviction verdict will be difficult.  That having been said, even if you *do* get convicted, if you are a first time undergraduate offender, it will amount to a mere slap on the wrist.  Do not lose sleep over this, just remain calm and collected with regard to making your case, and get on with your life at MaTech.  Even in cases of blatant cheating, it takes significant exertion for an OSI guilty verdict to be handed down for a cheating case.  If discovery in your case boils down to the effect of ""he said she said"" over a scantron for a single student with no supporting evidence from TAs, other members of your class, or any indication of systemic cheating, you will most likely find yourself in the proverbial clear.  By the way, professors expose themselves to potential chastisement from their department and the greater administration if they continually bring forth OSI cases which are found to be not guilty.

Obligatory:  if you are having difficulties with your coursework, reach out to the resources at GT that are available to you, and, if they are not helping, speak with your adviser about attempting to reduce your courseload for your next semester.  Resorting to cheating is a dangerous game, even though it is an endemic problem, especially at the undergraduate level in highly competitive environments such as Tech.

To summarize:  *If* you cheated, **stop** cheating, and move on.  That goes for anyone else reading this post.  People make mistakes, especially under pressure (and, when taking into account maintenance of scholarships, funding, etc.), just do not let this turn into a behavioral trend (or, if it is already, consider this a wake-up call to change your behavior).  Even if the evidence against you is flimsy, there is probably *some* good reason for the professor to have confronted you about this.  Professors and TAs are busy people, and, furthermore, are cognizant of how difficult OSI cases can be, so these types of accusations are *not* taken lightly.  Regardless, even if you are convicted, it will not be the end of your academic career at GT.  If you did not cheat, the chance of you being found guilty is slim to nil.

If you’re transferring in, then chances are you’ll have credit for core classes (math, lab sciences, etc.) that can be tricky. Look for other ID threads on this subreddit. ID is a smaller major, and majors seem to really like it.

Working out consistently is a great way to give yourself time to focus on your wellbeing and the endorphins help to make you feel less stressed. The CRC is great and even if you have no clue what you’re doing you can get started. If you want me to expand on this or give you advice about starting just let me know!

Having a scheduled day and time management skills can make overwhelming days a lot more doable and significantly less stressful. I used to feel super overwhelmed about all that I had to do, but then I started keeping a to do list and mentally (or sometimes physically) coming up with a list for the next day each night before I went to bed. Again, I can give you more specifics if you need more guidance. 

Finally, I would try looking at organizations, clubs, or anything of the sort that interest you. Finding your people - the ones who can support you when you’re having a rough day or just be there on a consistent basis - can help you feel connected and make a huge difference at a place like Tech. You say that you don’t have any that meet at the right times - I would keep looking or see if you can try to adjust your schedule for future semesters. That might help, but I’m not entirely sure how to address that detail.

I hope this stuff helps. I’m writing this somewhat quickly so I might be missing some obvious stuff I should include. I hope you find what you need and get to a better place. If I could do it, I’m sure you can - I believe in you!",positive,0.9905,positive,0.17300170068027207,02/12/2019

At my job as IT help at the CoC, I can either call off a day or arrive later to a shift if I end up with an especially heavy week.

comments,"Dammmnnn, someone is high strung!  &gt;horribly &gt;extremely &gt;Ever. &gt;absolutely &gt;permanently  Such charged grandiosity!  (Φ ᆺ Φ)

&gt;This is horribly misrepresenting the severity of an academic honor code violation and is an extremely shortsighted answer.

Not sure if you are trolling (if you are, your post is some 11/10 sarcasm, compliments to the chef 👨 🍳🖏), but, if not, I am also unsure as to why there is so much hostility, or if you are aware of how not only hyperbolic, but patently inaccurate [well, it *is* fun to write this way, isn't it?], ""extremely shortsighted"" sounds.  ʅ(°_◞°)ʃ  I am fairly certain that my post was rather circumspect as to the pragmatic outcomes and constructive actions that OP may take now and in the future, as well as delineating the reasonable potential consequences of such actions.  I also stated that, if convicted (and I even linked the sentencing guidelines), it would not be the end of their academic career at GT, which is true.  Unless there are aggravating circumstances surrounding this case, to which OP did not allude/provide, but you may be privately privy, OP will not even receive a suspension.

In my opinion, making a particular claim such as: ""There are several cases in which such a violation will permanently lock you out of a career path,"" if indeed true, speaks of your personal projection onto their intended academic path (or, again, if you know this person or have knowledge of additional circumstances), not to mention that you take a particular hypothetical ~~edge~~ specific case and extrapolate it into broader histrionics which are unwarranted.  I am apparently ""shortsighted,"" yet it is you who neglects to even provide evidence to support your claims that a *potential* transgression by OP has resulted in some irrevocably damaging scenario.  Let's take your assumption that OP is a BME or some such major intended on direct admission to medical school, and their particular dream graduate program at [insert program here such as JHU] states that any academic misconduct on record *permanently* precludes admission for life (unsure, though I would sincerely doubt it, and you yourself backpedal and proffer a scenario in which the student could return to academia after time in the work force), this would comprise a rather specific and speculative scenario outside the realm of OP's general post.  In your myopic view of reality, however, their life is apparently over, right?  Cheers to you, and enjoy living with that mindset (:

OP did not state that they were a medical student, first of all, or on some intended direct undergraduate&gt;graduate&gt;PhD/ScD/MD/DDS/JD/whathaveyou path.  Even if they are, what is the issue with transcripts being unsealed (duh?), or the fact that something is recorded as an institutional action?  If guilty, an OSI incident is obviously going to be on the transcript as a disciplinary probation (as I linked in the sanctions guideline), but I have no idea why you seem to indicate this is some permanent end-all to someone's academic or professional career (you did not state professional, but you immediately made the assumption that this person is tracked into a medical program [maybe you know them]).  What I can say is that students have failed out of Tech completely, received multiple OSI violations resulting in suspensions, and have been nonetheless able to rectify their academic and professional paths afterward, both at GT and at other top institutions.  Many corporations do not request academic transcripts unless they are an extremely competitive company to which you are applying straight out of undergrad (and I would doubt the majority would give a significant turd about a single academic violation in a scantron course early in their academic career which OP would explain), and I am similarly unaware of anything on the level of your purported ""severely unlikely to ever get into graduate school.""  I am not in the medical field, specifically, and it states in your flair that you are BME, so, I would defer to you in that perhaps there are zero-tolerance/no-redemption policies at some elite medical schools looking for any reason to differentiate between all direct &gt;3.8/4.0 GPA applicants straight out of undergrad, though, again (really flogging this dead horse here), that would be some specific scenario from which you make the massive leap into weaving some doomsday theatrics out of the mere *possibility* of receiving a single black mark.

Here's a reality check to your lack of circumspection, and to your ridiculously binary worldview:  You can have a ""fuck up"" on your academic transcript and still get into graduate school, even an elite graduate school.  The same goes for employment.

&gt;I really, really don't appreciate people misrepresenting the severity of these things

Of course, we have our own issues. Any program where there's no right answer or clear end point is inherently stressful and time-consuming. We have a reputation for ""living in studio"" but that's mostly because we keep our supplies there.

Currently the dining is outsourced, as in we pay a private corporation to run our dining halls. The top two contenders are Sodexo and Aramark, both of which are famous for a slew of controversies &amp; scandals, including mistreating prisoners in their private prisons. Both were involved in the ""ethics violations"" that led Campus Service administrators to resign.

Instead of outsourcing to one of these companies, Georgia Tech could just... not outsource. We'd hire all the Sodexo employees to work for GT and we'd run the dining halls ourselves. UGA runs its own dining halls, and they're [nationally ranked](https://www.redandblack.com/uganews/uga-dining-services-ranked-no-in-u-s/article_c637d98c-8d8e-11e7-ab21-573f856cfc86.html) for their dining hall quality. Meanwhile, everybody knows that GT dining sucks, and we have the most expensive dining plans of any USG institution (any public university in Georgia). Bringing it into GT's control means dining is more accountable to students, as opposed to being locked into a 15 year contract with a private company. Additionally, GT is not-for-profit, while Sodexo and Aramark are for-profit companies, so we're currently paying profits for their owners &amp; investors.

Simply put, public dining should be the default. People argue for privatization by saying ""private companies can handle this more efficiently and effectively than the government can"". But we've clearly seen that GT's private dining was terrible under Sodexo, and we have no reason to believe Aramark will be any better. The only bump in this is that it may cost a lot in the short-term to get all the infrastructure set up for GT to run its own dining halls, but in the long term it may be cheaper than privatized dining. Students have been very much excluded from the contract process, so we haven't seen any numbers or evaluations for the costs of a public dining option.

GT has a better scope of balancing the costs and quality (which is why UGA, KSU, and GSU all have better food and lower meal plan costs).

It's well-known within certain circles that OSI takes their core function of investigating academic and other non-criminal misconduct issues very seriously. If your professor does not have any damning evidence, there is a good chance this will be thrown out.

In regards to your comment (This is America, we have due process for a reason), it is false. Universities are allowed to mediate and decide on internal matters at their discretion. OSI operates on ""preponderance of evidence"". Essentially, the OSI employee can decide whatever they want and having heard from other students, are not student friendly.

I can't speak for USC, but I've heard UIUC has a really good CS program as well. Dining quality is definitely a factor in deciding what school to go to, but it shouldn't be **the** defining factor unless the food is absolute garbage (which, arguably, Tech's is not IMO).

comments,"Hey!

Don't put yourself down, it can get really tough especially during hell week. It can be tough adjusting to college life at first and making new friends, believe me, it gets much better.

Even if you can't join organizations because of time conflicts there are still other things you can do:

* the CRC is a great place to work out and even if you're not a gym buff who spends their life there, it's a great way to destress and stay healthy.
* there are also numerous pianos across campus (West Village, Student Center, and there's a building on West), if you enjoy music it's great to do that.
* i've been on only 1 ORGT trip but the trips or on weekends, and its a great way to meet a group of very friendly people.
* I'm not sure if you will have time, and I'm not Greek but a lot of my friends who are said they joined Greek Life to make new friends. Not saying you must, but maybe you can rush next semester?

As for your friends, try and sit down with your roommates and talk with them about what's going on and what you may be concerned about. If you're not comfortable with this, just invite them for dinner or a night out.

If you want to make new friends, try and talk to some of your friends in class. Don't feel anxious about introducing yourself, a lot of people (including myself sometimes) feel the other person might find it awkward or weird if you introduce yourself, but that is definitely not the case. This is how friendships start, we all want to have friends, have fun, and be around people who support us.

And hey, if you just want a new friend to talk to or if you ever feel down, just PM me.

Always there for you OP!

It's not a public vs. private problem, it's a caring vs. not caring problem.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I think Sodexo also operates dining for KSU, which has some of the best school dining in the country.

Think about it this way, Chick Fil A, Panera, Starbucks, etc. are all in it to make a profit just like Sodexo and yet they provide consistently better food than GT dining at a similar price with better service.

comments,"Depends on what kind of person you are and what you hope to get out of college. If you study engineering anywhere you'll have to balance rigorous courses with trying to do everything else you want to do. Tech may be marginally worse for that than some other schools, but the opportunities you'll have are significantly better in most cases.

Think about how much you value having a holistic experience and being exposed to many different kinds of people. Georgia Tech, outside of being involved in greek life, doesn't provide you many avenues to do that. You'll become a world class engineer but emphasis on every other form of development is frankly mediocre. 

Biggest con here is just the social interactions that take place. Unless you're satisfied with nerding out over fluid dynamics and playing smash, or if you have a very specific interest in a technical or religious club, you basically need to join a fraternity or sorority, and that's inherently flawed.

Here's the thing though, once you Get Out, tons of employers are going to see you as a ""Big Fish"". GT is intimidating to you now, and it should be, because Tech is supposed to be challenging. But...

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the OTHER thing: if you didn't have it in you to succeed, you probably would not have been admitted. And the OTHER OTHER big thing, that I had to learn the hard way, is don't be afraid to ask for help, whether that's TA/professor office hours, asking a classmate to cram for the final with you, or doing like I did during graduate school and asking my coworker to give me a crash course in RF engineering.

I don't know how common it is, but going to office hours was a huge barrier for me, though now I plan those into my schedule and head down constantly for homework help.

comments,"Pros:  Top-tier academics, tons of big companies recruit here, lots of student activities, excellent Greek Life community (if you choose to join - if not then that's just as cool), doesn't get too cold, amazing people, makerspaces, nice engineering facilities, nice campus recreation center, Division 1 athletics, GT Dining is improving, high ROI.

Cons:  Other places offer better quality campus services and housing, $$$ for out-of-state, not a lot of financial aid, CS 1371.

It's challenging, but you have to figure out how to be proactive to take care of yourself and your academics.  It sounds like you could get a head start adjusting to college and meeting people during the summer, which was helpful to my friends who did it (I didn't).  It's up to you to balance homework time and social time, but everyone else is too.  Especially as a freshmen, it's easy to make friends in classes and plan fun stuff outside of classes.  For example, there are on-campus activities, clubs, or just hanging out with friends.

Comparing the two schools, I've noticed that the greek students *in general* were better at time management and were all around better students. This was my observation of the general student population between the two schools. I think its less about being *really* smart and more about using time wisely. They also have easier access to study groups (from the house) and people who may have taken the class before.

Also (**for anyone else reading, especially for freshmen**) you can't compare how hard *you* work to how hard you *perceive* someone else to on the same task. Sure, the other person may have an easier time but at the end of the day you should be focused on yourself and your grades.

I also joined Greek Life as a second-year, and yes, it was easier to make friends there.  Did I *need* to join Greek Life?   
 That's subjective.  I've certainly enjoyed it, and it helped me grow as a person.  Again though, my experiences are not universal.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""every other form of development is frankly mediocre.""  Are you referring to social development, or something else?

I don't have a super wide view on this, but I've noticed some guys I'm with do have some specific skills to party twice a week. It is an interesting phenomenon that at Tech and elsewhere, IFC GPA average beats schoolwide male GPA average. I'm not saying everyone does all of these, but my brothers skew towards doing these.

- Not being involved in major time sink on-campus orgs like or for-pay jobs, but rather opting for smaller time commitment orgs.

- Spending less time playing video games than is otherwise common, maybe?

- Not being super worried about perfection: I know some people choose to spend huge amounts of time making sure they know test content 100%, but most brothers seem to be focused on getting work ""done"" and tests studied ""enough""

- Since fraternities skew towards wealthier students nationwide, they probably skew towards having better high schools and such. I don't know if this is true for Tech where Out of State probably skews wealthier but less frat.

- Having the social skills and willing friends to find help when they need it. It's not like frat word is super exclusive or helpful, but finding individuals outside of office hours to help with one-off homework questions or whatever can be a lot easier when you have willing friends.",positive,0.9968,positive,0.12243827160493828,02/15/2019

comments,"I graduated from GT’s Public Policy program in 2006 and weighed the same decision. I got into both UGA and Tech.  As others have said GT’s undergrad degree is a bachelor of science. Don’t do it if you aren’t committed to taking lab sciences, basic coding, and challenging math classes. Personally I struggled through the lab sciences, but would still do it all again.  Also if you want to go to law school at some point, and math/science is not your thing, consider what impact GT might have on your GPA. Law schools will surely take that into consideration, but only to a point.

But being in Atlanta is a huge benefit just for the proximity to internships, networking, and job opportunities.  It’s probably hard to know at this point, but think about how you want to use your degree and where you may want to use your degree.  And if the math/science part scares you but Atlanta seems like a good fit, you should also consider Georgia State. They have a strong program.

comments,"I thought that way too and started here in physics.

Physics is one of those majors that You’re less likely to get a job with just a bachelors degree so if you’re planning on not doing grad school physics is not for you. Job prospects are more catered to academia. despite what any physics major here will tell you they will have to shoot through hoops for a job with just an undergrad degree and over 60% get a graduate degree and 50% of those do not get it in physics.

Engineering is more hands on and I changed my major my fourth year after seeing better job prospects without having to dedicate 10 years. 

If you’re more worried about money and job prospects you cannot go wrong with engineering but at Tech they are more specialized by subtypes. So choose the right one. Physics is more broad and umbrella here. Research however is very easy to get into with physics due to size of department and it looks really good for graduate applications than internships or coops. 

The main takeaway is unless you’re not planning on graduate school, do not expect a job with physics ",positive,0.9129,positive,0.2284193121693122,02/16/2019

One of the few things we would like fixed is reliability of the trains themselves. Our transit system isn't that big, but for some reason our trains are constantly breaking down. There is almost always a delay. Not to mention that there isn't even a real schedule that is followed. A train might leave at 10:00 one day and 10:10 the next.

Another thing we want fixed are the Kiosks. How many times do you have to swipe your credit card because the kiosk can't read it. We are also advocating for a way to allow people to refill their cards online or even take advantage of NFC chips in their cell phones.

These are just some of the few things we want from our MARTA system. We hope you will support our cause!",positive,0.8706,neutral,0.04949494949494949,02/16/2019

I didn't think Tech was THAT hard. I got my studying and homework in and still had time to play 2+ hours of overwatch on any given day in addition to all the random internet browsing I did.

Of course there were hell weeks where I was super stressed out and really pushing myself mentally, but overall, honestly, I don't think Tech was as hard as this post might suggest. It was challenging but not overly difficult. Especially given the super rampant grade inflation that's been going on for the past decade (check lite.gatech.edu, I'm not just talking out of my ass) getting a 3.3+ is absolutely not prohibitively difficult for most people here.    

I feel like I've heard that sentiment a lot (i.e. people complain a lot as a coping mechanism and most people will be fine) so I just wanted to chime in this thread and drop that reminder again. If you study smart and prioritize then you won't have too much difficulty here.

comments,"People are going to comment about how much this video resonated with them. Then other people will recommend them to join clubs, talk to people in class, and so on. This is well intentioned advice, but I don't think it's a real solution because it's misunderstanding the actual problem.

It's not just about having nobody to be around. The real problem is being unable to connect deeply with another individual.

To listen to another person's thoughts and feelings. To share your own thoughts and feelings. The parts of yourself you most want to share with someone else, yet never do. To be accepted. appreciated. acknowledged.

As this video aptly points out, our ancestors were born and died within communities of 50-150 people. I can imagine they were way better emotionally adjusted than we are. We live in a 'highly connected' world, but only if our sole metric is the number of connections. Clearly the number matters way less than the \*strength\* of the connections.

Joining a club is not likely to fix this problem. It's just another way to disappear into a crowd. Any solution offered needs to take into account the mental and emotional state of someone who feels soul crushingly lonely.

Here's one idea that occurred to me. Imagine a situation where a stranger comes to you and starts a conversation which enables you to talk about something you love. What questions/comments did they make to get you on that topic? The more general the questions, the better. Think of great conversations you've had in the past. The kind which gave you energy and raised your spirits as you walked away.

Now go be that person. You don't have to approach strangers. In fact this would probably work better on people you already have rapport with. So when you find yourself in a conversation, really try to get the other person talking about something they love. You'll know you're getting really close when they raise their eyebrows and open up their body language. That's a strong, universal signal of interest.

This is the real discussion we need to have. How can we connect more deeply with each other?",positive,0.9945,positive,0.17181465821000705,02/17/2019

comments,"Psychiatry is just focused on treating mental conditions through medication. The initial consultation is figuring out whether medication is right for you. You don't meet with one of the actual psychiatrists, but one of the assistants. They don't diagnose or prescribe anything, but help determine whether medication is an option for you. I don't know what exactly the criteria are, but if it's questionable they'll likely ask you whether you think it would be helpful.     
At the end of the consultation you'll be referred to off campus psychologists unless you're already seeing someone. There will typically be a variety of different ones with different styles and insurances, and the assistants will even schedule an appointment with you to help find one you think will be helpful if you think that would help. Unless you've taken medication before, they typically very much encourage you to see a psychologist in addition to them to get as much help as you can.     
If you decide you want to go through with medication, they'll schedule you with one of the psychiatrists, who will then go through a more thorough diagnosis. From there they'll talk to you about different medication options and what they'd recommend, but will go with your decision. I used an antidepressant years ago, so we went with the same one I was previously on.       
The process can take a bit, since they've only got so many psychiatrists who can take on so many patients. It's definitely better to go sooner, since more people try to make appointments later in the semester. I'd also try to make the appointment in person if you've got a tight calendar so you're not going back and forth trying to schedule via voicemail and missing each others calls.      
Hope this helps! I've found medication works really well for me, and the folks at stamps psychology are really friendly and doing the best they can to help you. Hope you find the help you need",positive,0.997,positive,0.1324574829931973,02/17/2019

comments,"It took me about 3 weeks for the initial consultation, but that was partially due to my schedule. They can typically get the initial consultation faster than the counseling center can. It can vary though, which is why I'd suggest going to check with them in person to get a better idea of their availability. It took a month and a half to get an appointment with one of the psychiatrists though. Part of that was over Christmas break, which meant that some of them were on holiday, but it also meant that those who were in had more time to take on new patients, especially since some patients were graduating. It really depends on how soon you think you need to start treatment. If you think you can go a couple of months before treatment starts, they may be a good option. If not, then I'd definitely look for outside help. I'd still recommend going in to talk to them about getting an initial consultation scheduled, if for no other reason than to have it as a backup option in case you have issues getting scheduled somewhere outside of campus. They'll hopefully be able to give you a better timeline of what their availability and timeline looks like if you schedule in person.

comments,"Great question. There’s a good bit under consideration on improving nighttime transit.  This response will be a long one. But broadening the discussion a bit, to address Stingerette we also have to address evening Stinger service.  

Here are a few changes and potential ideas currently being considered. Your feedback and thoughts welcome. 

Short Term/Within The Next 6 Months:
-The new gps system implemented two weeks ago will greatly help the visibility of the Midnight Rambler for those wanting an (often) quicker transit option.  Our data from the fall semester shows that there was nearly a 100% increase in Midnight Rambler ridership when the GPS worked. This is obviously a no brainer on why; no one wants to wait outside at night when you don’t know if the bus is coming.  But it’s important we are addressing this issue so that evening fixed route transit can carry more riders and because fixed route transit is overall more economical to provide than point-to-point Stingerette. 

-Our nightly average wait time this academic year for Stingerette have been about 10 mins.  Only 13% of all riders had a wait time of over 20 minutes.  But there are some key hours in which ride requests spike.  And many of those users cancel or ghost their ride requests during these times.  Additionally we’ve noticed some users putting in a request, and then canceling when the Midnight Rambler arrives. These cancelations can skew the wait times of others.

-We are evaluating the hours of the Stingerette operation. Including start time of the operation, which is currently at 6 PM.  At 6 PM most Stinger buses and Trolleys are still going in full force. It’s quite possible Stingerette could start a little later in the future, say 7 PM. It’s also possible that the start time could flex with the seasons, starting later when it’s bright outside later. 

-If the service start time change happens, we would reinvest those resources into providing more transit when it’s needed during the evening, during peak times.

-We also know a large number of trips on Stingerette are to Home Park. So we are evaluating Green Route, it’s evening routing, as well as ways to extend its hours a little later.  Again it’s important we enhance and support fixed route when possible because of the transit efficiencies, and because that will help keep Stingerette for those that need it most. 

More Long Term:
-There’s the real possibility that we need to rethink all our nighttime transit. Over the next year we will be completing a comprehensive transit study that will do a deep dive into these types of questions. Is there a better or more effective way that we can operate in the evening.?  Would a flex-route (a hybrid of fixed route and point-to-point transit) make more sense?

-Also the sheer number of new student apartment complexes just-off campus means we are seeing a monumental change in demand.  We will be looking at bringing these new apartments into the conversation on transit and nighttime safety. What can we partner on together?  Many universities have adopted transit partnerships with student housing complexes to provide better transit to/from campus, and it is surely worth us looking into the possibilities there.

I’m sure there are other things I’ve forgotten, but this is a pretty good overview of many of the changes being considered. What are we missing?

This poll is really important and that is why I think SGA is posting it after it was already passed.

All it says is that *if* a bill were to come up, then we can say that Georgia Tech students do/do not support legalization.

I also write out how much time projects and readings will take, and I plan when I'll work on what so that I don't end up with everything due when I have other plans. I keep my local storage and Google Drive separated by semester and class so that my docs aren't all over the place and I can work on stuff wherever I need to. 

I'm suuuuper detailed, so it might be too much for someone else lol, but I firmly believe in to-do lists. I had to learn to think ""what do I need to get done"" before using unexpected free time for pure chill. This seems awful, but being disciplined actually gives you more true free time. Another thing, if you have a social life (I hope you do!), learn to say ""no"" sometimes. Despite our beliefs, we can't always fit it all in\~

Also set up work practices that make you productive. If you can get things done in your room, cool. If you can't (it's pretty hard to not just slack off), work in other places.

Regarding UTC, it is true that the space is not in the plans for the new Campus Center. There are two main reasons. Firstly, the intention of the new space, a reservable performing arts theater, is to make the space accessible to a wider population at Tech. MN will be able to reserve this space for all their performances while allowing other student orgs to do the same. Secondly, GT Legal states that student orgs are not allowed to completely own and operate a space, and extra staff would have to be hired and devoted entirely to UTC.

Regarding the campanile, current plans retain the water feature. However, it is true that the stairs are being removed. This is in the spirit of making this space accessible to more of campus. The stairs are being replaced with terraces that will seat more than currently possible, and it will make the space ADA accessible so that anyone can enjoy the space.

I feel like I’ve had a way harder time connecting with people on my hall and my pl’s in Glenn because of it being so big and spread out. Glenn being closer to the road is definitely a big advantage though, especially for move in and when you bring stuff home/back during breaks and weekends. game days there’s A LOT of action/music/foot traffic in front of the dorm if you’re trying to sleep in on those couple Saturdays in the fall.

There are certainly people who go to med school from here, but I don't think many of them had a fun time getting there. 

ALIS / MES as an undergrad for med school is also not what I commonly see... I'm curious why you picked that for undergrad?

If you want med school, you really have to go all in on that - and you'll probably be drowning in loans (with the salary to pay them off .... eventually), so I'd give serious consideration to a fully funded undergraduate degree program. ",positive,0.9477,positive,0.17993551587301587,02/19/2019

I am a 3rd year premed here so I am the guy to ask.

I would strongly suggest not coming here if you have a full scholarship to FIU in miami.

 Are you instate tho, because then it would be pretty cheap with Zell Miller.

If not, DO NOT come here. Unless you are literally excessively rich and just have money to blow, doing premed here out of state and wasting money is useless. No one cares where you went to college if you are going to medical school. You will end up wasting so much money.

Apart from the money this school is crazy hard. Doing premed and keeping a 3.8+ GPA is very very difficult and is honestly too stressful. 

I came here for the prestige, but I was instate so I mean it was not as bad because it was cheap AF. 

If I had paid for this shit, i would literally be sad AF right now. 

Also only like 20% of premed who started as premed here are able to get into medical school, almost all of my friends from freshmen year dropped.

So go to FIU for free, you can get better grades and graduate without a loan..and then go a good medical school and become a doctor!!

comments," So I’m a fourth-year at Tech majoring in ALIS with a concentration in Japanese. ALIS definitely isn’t something that Tech is known for, but I do like the program, especially compared to language programs at other schools. I can’t speak for French, but the Japanese program here is phenomenal and has widened up so many possibilities for me. It's shown me the different ways that I can integrate a foreign language into a career, and there is definitely more emphasis on the science and technology aspects of language (perhaps because it’s Georgia Tech, but also because technology has become such a huge part of Japanese culture. I’m not sure if the French program is the same way). You also have plenty of opportunities to conduct research and do internships, especially through study abroad, which is required for ALIS. Aside from your target language, you’re also required to select a “cluster” concentration for the major that you can also declare as a minor. It helps to choose something related to business or technology, but it can be any field of study as long as your advisor approves. I feel confident knowing that I can get a job with a foreign language (and have already received several offers), and I honestly can’t say that I’d feel the same way had I majored in a generic language program at a different university. It’s not just the prestige of Tech that matters, but the fact that its language program prepares you for getting a job with a foreign language.

However, if med school is your top priority, then I would say go to FIU, especially since you have a full ride and really like the school. As long as you put in the effort towards med school and are happy with FIU’s program, then you will do well there. And if you ever decide that French is something you’d like to pursue, then at least you know that you have options at Tech.",positive,0.9925,positive,0.09775641025641028,02/19/2019

Crime does happen, the vast majority (in my personal observations) involve property crimes like theft of weakly secured valuables or the occasional car break-in.    Home Park (right north of campus) has become a lot less notorious for crime over the years, in part thanks to GTPD and APD's efforts.

comments,"1) Campus often seems to feel like a bubble. Especially if you live on West campus, you could spend your entire semester on campus and almost forget that you live in a major city. That being said, many people do spend time in Midtown, which is right across the highway from Tech. Furthermore, many students live in either Midtown or Home Park instead of living in on-campus dorms. 

2) Midtown, Downtown, and Home Park border tech to the east, south, and north respectively. Midtown has an energetic, ""young and hip"" vibe. Downtown often has more of your typical city feel. Home Park looks and feels somewhat slum-like, but a lot of students live in the houses (including me) and it's way safer than it was a few years ago. Crime is about as common as it is in any major city. Make smart choices and you probably won't have any issues. 

3) Coming from the northeast, this was actually a pretty big concern of mine. I often feel like Atlanta is a good mix between the northern and southern feel. You'll definitely hear some more southern accents than you're used to, but other than that there aren't too many differences. (Except for food, I have officially become addicted to Chick-fil-A and can never leave the south again)

4) I hope I've answered this a little bit in the previous three answers, but honestly, it's hard to say what the ""overall vibe"" is unless you visit. You'll also find that the vibe on campus will be different than the vibe off campus. All I can say is that I absolutely loved moving here. I disliked NYC a lot, but I found I really enjoyed Georgia Tech and Atlanta because I had access to the city but didn't feel claustrophobic.

comments,"I would say that some of these responses greatly vary on you and your friend group, but I'll try to provide one more perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

The campus isn't super secluded from the city; we have defined boundaries, but it's still open-access and non-gated, so city influence is strong here. As for how often students go out, it depends. If you're a freshman who stays on-campus, eats in dining halls, and doesn't want to go off campus, you can stay on campus as much as you want. Most people tend to either live off campus or at least make their own food while living in on-campus apartments, so upperclassmen (like me) tend to go off campus about once every week for groceries and such and for occasional outings (birthday celebrations, programs put on by student government, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Living in the middle of the city is never super safe, but as long as you play it smart, you'll be fine. Don't go off campus after dark without a group of friends. We have the occasional reports of robberies off campus, but we don't have much if any crime on campus. Worst I've heard is a bicycle being stolen \[on campus\].

&amp;#x200B;

Atlanta is really cosmopolitan; you'll find some Southern people, but a pretty significant part of our population is either from other parts of the country (like the northeast) or from different countries entirely, especially on campus.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how to describe the general vibe here. GT's a medium sized school with a varied population, so you can't just describe a few adjectives to it and call it a day. We do have quite a studious atmosphere- most of us come here to seriously pursue an education after all- but most of us tend to be nice people. We just enjoy poking fun at various things, groups, and people through memes, but most of the time we don't mean any harm. The campus (especially in terms of housing) is divided into East and West, with the central part of campus housing the bulk of non-residential buildings. East is definitely more lively and has a more urban vibe- if you enjoy having a blooming social life or are interested in Greek life, you should definitely try living on East. I personally prefer West more, and that's because it's quieter. It's got a suburban feel to it, and while we are socially active on West, there's much less nightlife going on. Going back to overall vibes, you can find the vibe you're looking for; you just have to reach out for it (or not reach out for it honestly). The only thing you won't find here is super-competitive athletics; we love our Yellow Jackets, don't get me wrong, but they're definitely not the best in the country or even in the Southeast, so be prepared to see our teams lose more games than we win sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

comments,"As a previous member I can respond to this and a few other things in this thread (any current members, feel free to add or correct, my memory is hazy).  

One reason they print such a large number of copies is to have a lot of copies available as a promise to advertisers.  They don't get much money from SGA and have to use ad money to stay afloat, so being able to grant the potential of a paper getting 1,000+ pick ups one week from a controversial topic, or story that is just a must-read allows the Nique to charge more for ad space. 

In regards to extra papers, I believe there is a number that are saved for hard back copies in the office, and some that are saved for a pseudo-library of issues there too, and the rest are recycled.  As a note, it is a bad idea to pick up a lot of papers without the intent to read or spread the information.  If you were to say, pick up all the papers in the Student center for the purpose of donating to AHS, you are actually infringing on the first amendment in regards to freedom of press and you can be charged with such. 

In regards to the state of the Nique itself, it has had it ups and downs for sure, but I think it is an important outlet for students to have and realize that newspapers are an important media source where they can have their voices heard on a national scale.  An opinion piece could go viral in the same way a tweet could, for better or for worse.

&gt; Freedom of the press in the United States is legally protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. This amendment is generally understood to prevent the government from interfering with the distribution of information and opinions.

EDIT:  Last bit of info I found with further wikipedia-ing because it was interesting. You are right that this isn't a 1st amendment issue, however there is likely [legal action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_theft#Newspaper_Theft_on_University_Campuses) that can be taken against someone if they did try to trash all the papers.  The Nique has a stipulation in it saying ""first copy free, additional copies call this number XXX"" which makes taking more than one copy theft (As you stated, but I wanted it confirmed).  This statement seems to have been added after the incident I previously mentioned, meaning nothing was likely done in that instance.  However, along with this theft, the paper could now seek further action for damages they could claim for the advertisers losing viewers.  

Separately, bulk purchasing papers from somewhere can be infringing on first amendment rights as seen [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper_theft#Purchase_with_the_intent_to_block_distribution) The catch is that there has to be intent, but that could be obvious based on who buys the papers.

As other commenters have mentioned we run a print paper to earn ad revenue to both pay staff and the paper. The problem is that ad revenue is starting to dry up in print and online ads don’t earn nearly the same amount of money that print ones do.

Why don’t we print an ad-less paper then? That would actually cost SGA, who we get our print funding from, more money. Additionally, printing the paper is an economy of scale, the fewer we print the more it costs per copy.

Classes like OS design is becoming more available  because ece courses like 3056 are being redesigned to be a pre req and give you credit for a CS class (CS2200).  Freshman as also now taking python (CS1301) and matlab (1371).

&amp;#x200B;

This is reddit. so a whole bunch of people will come up on this page and complain + vent. Not alot of people come up onto this page and is like 'wow i love my school let me tell everyone because that is what I want to do with my time instead of actually hanging out with my friends'. so I figured while the linked article is correct, I want ot just my few words.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is \~ MY \~ take

Yea. a good number of us are closeted CS majors. and by the time we realized it was too late to switch. Some of us, who are interested in the hardware side of computing, high level networking, or cyber security (this one is me)   enjoy our major.

Yea. Some classes suck. I have had 3 classes that have taught me doubly linked list (ECE 2035, ECE 3020, and a 4000+ class) and I would give a kidney for 3020 to be replaced with CS1332 so I can do data structures as well as a CS major. But again. every major has a few BS classes.

Yea, our administration sucks. but like they try \*\*shrug\*\* . every advising office on this campus seems overloaded. We have important classes that have no professors and get canceled, and we sometimes have so many special topics classes that you have to make some tough choices of what you think is more important for your career.

Yea, we get jobs. Never had an issue getting a job or internship, and I am not even close to a 4.0 student. Also I have had no trouble getting into grad school for masters in CS.

if you come into ECE with a good idea of what you want, and plan classes accordingly, then you will get alot of out the program. I came in like 'cool, i like networking and cyber security' and because of that I struggled though 3 classes I hated but in return got to take 6 Cyber security course and networking courses. (those 20 hours of ECE electives means alot) (my networking courses was lot more then theory as well) 

ECE and CS both have strong and weak points points. If you want to do ML/AI, apps, etc look at CS, and if you want to do Cyber security, embedded systems, or hardware look at CmpE (you can still do everything is CS but you may have better luck in ECE)

To summarize:  constantly recording microphones and infrared cameras which allegedly automatically process the signature of gunfire.  As a side note, there does not appear to be any independent auditing performed to ensure that voice and such is not being secretly recorded/transmitted out of these devices.  We are supposed to simply ""trust"" this quasi-governmental entity, just like we trust FAANG corporations, which have broken that trust in the past.  This technology began development in the 90s by DARPA for warzones.  It is rather impressive technology, to be sure, and seems accurate and cost-effective for usage in warzones, as well as high security, controlled locations with massive budgets, such as transit hubs and airports.  For a rather open campus with budgetary constraints (if tuition hikes are to be believed, etc.) such as GT, I would like to see an actual, appreciable cost-benefit analysis, if this even occurred.  Maybe a bit of an extra bonus cash for GTPD, although, they probably were one of the major deciding factors in the ""for"" camp for this system.

Another way that helped me was to look at it kinda like exercise. If your goal is to get healthier you have to force and discipline yourself into working out, eating right etc. Those activities are not enjoyable in themselves but they help you get to your goal of a physically healthy body.

Existential dread is similar in that if your goal is to truly stop thinking this way you have to force and discipline yourself into doing things that lift the dread. Those differ for everyone and you have to try different things out and see which help. For me trying a new thing every weekend (I have to force myself to do this), socializing with certain friends and writing really help.

comments,"I think I have went through the exact same feelings last semester. For me it rooted from the fact that I did not like what I was doing. The second reason was that I did not have any social life and practically no one to talk to. And being an international student does not help too. Not only can I not visit my parents often(at max once a  year), even talking to them regularly is a challenge as there is a huge time difference and I cannot call them anytime I would like to. I tried a couple of things which helped and currently I am in a much better situation. First, deeply analyze if you like what you do. However, for many people although they might not like what they do, they do it for the end goal i.e maybe a job, a paper(for phd scholars),etc. Find your reason and motivate yourself by focusing on the reason if you don't really like what you do now (this is just a phase). The second thing that helped me is a study group. Being a Georgia Tech student we really don't get much time to socialize and even if we do, oftentimes we feel guilty for neglecting out studies and socializing. So I tried to get a study partner. I tried may ways. One effective way I found is to go to TA hours where many students come and try to find someone who will be interested to study with you. Worst case, you can DM me, and we can study together. You will get through it mate!  ",negative,-0.8402,positive,0.10833333333333335,02/20/2019

It’s hard to engage in your classes when you feel like you have the same monotonous routine every day and don’t have any strong connections with the environment around you. I’m very introverted and haven’t made any long-lasting friendships at Tech since I’ve been so busy with my normal life and work, but I’m trying to change that. Just talking to my classmates more and trying to go to at least one event on campus a week and exploring the area more. For now, I’ve mostly just been making the usual small-talk with the different people I meet, but relationships also take time to develop, and I’m hoping that I eventually do manage to make a stronger connection with someone. You may have to get out of your comfort zone a little bit to do this though, it’s definitely out of mine.

In the time being though, it’s very important to focus on the things that you enjoy, no matter how small they are. Make your favorite brew of tea or coffee in the morning. Take a break between studying and watch an episode of a show/anime you’ve been meaning to watch. Schedule time to make one of your favorite meals for dinner. Read a few pages of a good book before bed. A lot of this probably sounds really cliché, but taking the time to make yourself feel better and do more things you like can make it easier to put the same energy into other activities. You’ll also find that your day still goes by pretty fast, but you also got a lot more out of it.

I hope this helps, and if you ever want to talk, feel free to send a message.",positive,0.9967,positive,0.19216145833333334,02/20/2019

comments,"I believe that life does have a point. I think we are meant to help each other and learn about what it means to be not only human but also part of the tree of life. You are here, and this part of your life matters. Your birth itself altered the state of the universe. Maybe you will never know the exact purpose of your life because sometimes our purpose is silent to us, but we are still significant and our purpose still exists. I don’t think we create our purpose. I think our purpose just has us “do.” In addition, religion and spirituality call to us. I think they are aware of how confusing and frustrating it is that so many of them exist. But if they are calling, we have to answer the call with the hope of getting something beautiful out of it. Otherwise the message just goes in one ear and out the other. Religion and spirituality are kind of like dating, lol.

Sorry I sound cheesy but I do believe what I just wrote. I understand why you don’t think counseling would work;really, I do. But maybe counseling could just be a reminder that you are not alone. Someone loves helping people so much that they are willing to listen to you! And yes they would give you advice eventually but it does make a difference when there is someone to hold you accountable to getting to the place where you have a more positive outlook. : )

comments,"If you're spending your free time reading- read the Myth of Sisyphus. It's Albert Camus introduction to Absurdism.

It's pretty clear that life doesn't have a lot of meaning and in some ways, everything you do is, in fact, futile-you're not wrong about that. We will all die. We will leave with nothing as we came with nothing and the work you are doing at Tech right now really won't mean much. So now what? Once you have accepted this information as fact or obvious, it is your decision what to do with it.  The thing is, life isn't that short. It's the longest thing you will ever experience and it's much too long to not care about. Better use of your time than contemplating your existence, would be just trying to enjoy and work towards creating a life that is well-balanced-because really what else is there even to do?

Also, understand that you do NOT have to justify your own existence. This idea that your life is only worth living if its remarkable is ridiculous. I struggled with the idea for a long time but know that doing the best you can with the resources you are given is all you can do and living a quiet life is totally acceptable and can be incredibly fulfilling.

You can understand and be aware of how insignificant you are in and to the world and still try to find joy in the time you have here and be optimistic about the future. God knows that's what the rest of us are doing.

Feeling this way is not a ""GT thing,"" this is an ill of the industrialized West (alum here, it doesn't go away after you graduate and start ""making it"").

I have no real answers here, save for maybe some literature suggestions.

The power of the written word lies in its ability to bridge the vast gulf between minds; to know that you're not alone. I'd recommend the French author Michel Houellebecq and the British philosopher John Gray. 

If you have a good friend or two with a track record of trustworthiness perhaps talk to them about it, they've probably felt the same way.

comments,"First off, I want to ask: what meaning do you think life should have? Like, what are the criteria for meaning you think human life doesn't fulfill? What is the value of life having a meaning? Meaning for whom?

I went through something similar at that age, and definitely came through it. A ton of people do as well, especially young men, and in fact I think it's almost part of growing up. Maybe it's something of a childish fantasy to believe that there needs to be some momentous cosmic purpose to our lives or else there's no point to anything. It's important to mourn the loss of that belief, and follow it up with the mature understanding that whether or not it's part of some cosmic narrative, it's pleasant to be alive and experience the sensations of living. It's fulfilling to try hard at a goal we deem worthy, and fulfilling to give and receive love. Because we experience these things as meaningful, they have meaning; we don't need some cosmic father figure to pat us on the head to justify our existence. 

It sounds to me like your ""existential crisis"" also may be a symptom of depression. I was deeply depressed at your age, and the book ""the how of happiness"" helped me immensely. If you dm me an address to send it to (or want me to just leave it on a table in the student center at a specific time), I'll send you a copy. In any case, I'm glad you're reaching out here for help.

It's terrible to hold them in.I was once in a similar boat and no matter how busy I kept myself, that existential dread was always present.

The thing is...nothing is really meaningful unless you choose to make it so. Then again it does sound like mild depression so that could also be giving you a heck of a time. Might want to checked just in case.  


If everything is pointless, why not do what you enjoy? If we're all heading towards an end, why not enjoy the time you have available? You'll be okay, even if life knocks you down. Your life will not end over lower grades. I'm not saying give up and flunk your classes but rather get out there and experience what you can. Get help, if you choose so. Take it a bit at a time. Take it from someone who was once a pessimistic nihilist. Once you realize the freedom of meaningless, things open up a bit.

comments,"That's right. In particular, this script starts at a random word from the source, then uses probabilities from the source text to generate the next word, and the next, until it's generated a (randomly-selected) number of words. The states are actually more than single words -- they're a collection of multiple words, and there's (mostly) enough input data to figure out the probabilities of a sucessor given the last two or three words, rather than just the last single word.

Then, it chops off some words from the front until it sees something that looks like the start of a new sentence, and chops from the end until it sees something that looks like the end of a sentence. It also adds paragraph breaks randomly in between sentences, but other than that there's not much intelligence to the thing.",negative,-0.0724,neutral,-0.01744453463203463,02/21/2019

comments,"Suppose we have a few sentences in our source text that look like this:

    I ate tacos.
    He ate bananas.
    I drew ampersands.
    He drew dragons.
    I ate fruitcake.

A Markov-chain text generator will look at the source text and draw the following insights:

    After the word ""I"", the next word is ""ate"" 2/3 of the time and ""drew"" 1/3 of the time.
    After ""He"", the next word is ""ate"" 1/2 of the time and ""bananas"" 1/2 of the time.
    After ""ate"", there's an equal 1/3 distribution of ""tacos"", ""bananas"", and ""fruitcake"".
    After ""drew"", the next word is ""ampersands"" 1/2 of the time and ""dragons"" 1/2 of the time.

So the script will choose some random starting word, like ""I"", then just use those same probability distributions to build sentences. Maybe the script chooses ""ate"" as the next word, because that's what happens 2/3 of the time we see ""I"" in the original text, and then ""bananas"" as the next word, because that happens 1/3 of the time we see ""ate"" in the original text. The script managed to write the sentence ""I ate bananas"" even though the source text never had that sentence. When faced with the task of choosing the next word, it looks at the last word it generated, does a lookup in the source text, and figures out what words are likely to come next.

Of course, this technique doesn't really have any ""memory"". Suppose the source text had these two sentences:

    I ate bananas yesterday.
    I think bananas are cool.

The script might take the opportunity to write the sentence ""I ate bananas are cool"", which doesn't make any sense, but it happened because the script doesn't really know how sentences work. It's just willing to choose any potential successor of ""bananas"", no matter what happened in the past.

You can make these sentences a little more intelligible (and a little less creative) by keeping a longer memory of words. If we used the above sentences as our input, instead of storing `'bananas' -&gt; 'yesterday' or 'are'`, you could store `'ate bananas' -&gt; 'yesterday', 'think bananas' -&gt; 'are'`, so that the script knows that the word ""yesterday"" shouldn't follow ""think bananas"", only ""ate bananas"". Then, after generating a new word, the script slides the window forward by one word and predicts the next word based on ""bananas yesterday"". This doesn't fundamentally solve the problem that the script doesn't really know how sentences work, but it does make it less likely for a sentence to derail unintelligibly because a single common word (with many possible successors) got generated.",positive,0.6524,neutral,0.047665043290043285,02/21/2019

comments,"Hello, I am currently a double major in Mechanical Engineering and Physics and personally, I would suggest trying a double major as well and if you seem to prefer one over the other, make that major a minor. Your first year will generally be the same in both majors, but during the second year it starts to split up.

&amp;#x200B;

Taking higher level courses in physics has exposed me to a tremendous amount of mathematical concepts that I see recurring in my engineering courses constantly. Courses like statics, dynamics, fluid dynamics, and mechanics of materials are generally very physics based courses that shouldn't be too hard for a physics major. Other courses in mechanical engineering involve machining and manufacturing, which is an entirely different field in its own. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you enjoy the math, I would recommend a physics major. The math in Engineering is not easy by any means, but its nothing compared to what you will learn in physics. However, you will not have many (if at all) hands on projects throughout your undergrad. 

&amp;#x200B;

As far as homework goes, my engineering homeworks are generally very long, but not too difficult. My physics homework is the complete opposite. The higher level courses like Quantum Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism only give 5 problems a week but they can be extremely difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

The average salary for both majors are very similar. All of the graduates from my school have either gotten great jobs or pursued higher degrees. I don't seem to understand why people assume the job market for physics majors is bad, given that they are essentially able to apply their knowledge to any STEM industry. I wouldn't worry about your future career too much, both majors will get you a solid job.",positive,0.9735,positive,0.05392045454545455,02/21/2019

At least take CS 1332 (Data Structures and Algorithms), you'll be expected to know common data structures. Plus you're gonna have a hard time learning ML algorithms without knowing the basic algorithms.

Also recommend taking CS 3600 (Intro to AI). As you guessed, some parts of that class are basically an intro to ML. It's much easier than CS 4631 and will give you practical python experience. Idk if that would fit in with your minor, but ML will be a lot easier if you take this first!

comments,"Good Afternoon Jackets,

This is Will Smith from the Office of Emergency Management ready to answer any of your questions.  I've been at Georgia Tech for almost 10 years working in Emergency Management.  We work with most campus departments in preparing for and responding to emergencies and disasters.  Part of our responsibilities includes everyone's favorite alert system, GTENS.  In my capacity, I also oversee our 911 Operations Center on campus and manage our great Police Communications Officers who answer your calls 24/7 365.

I'm a Georgia Tech graduate (INTA, '01) and have enjoyed watching the campus grow since coming back as an employee.

I'm happy to take any questions, but will be able to best answer your questions on:

1. Emergency Planning &amp; Operations
2. 911 Operations
3. Weather 
4. GTENS
5. Our new GTPD Building!

Thanks for joining us today!

We really do not have anything too off the wall.  We did write a campus evacuation plan, and that is highly unlikely to be used or needed.  Unfortunately, most of our plans are rather boring.

Typically, we write plans based upon risk.  Risk is comprised of the threat (likelihood), vulnerability, and consequences.  So even though Georgia Tech is highly vulnerable to a Zombie Attack, we thankfully have a threat of 0.  Thus, our risk is 0.

comments,"I graduated from Tech and still had no idea what I really wanted to do.  After graduation, I pursued careers with both the CIA and the State Department, but really thought it was a poor fit for me.  I was in the Marine Corps Reserves during and after my time at Tech. After 9/11, we knew it was only a matter of time before we would be activated and deployed.  So, I did a tour in Iraq and had plenty of time in a war zone to contemplate life.  I was assigned to Mortuary Affairs during the deployment and conducted numerous recovery missions.  While I was deployed, I discovered this field and it connected with both my education and passions: weather, terrorism, emergency response. 

I came back and immediately enrolled in Georgia State's MPA program that had a certificate in Disaster Management.  I started working with the Atlanta-Fulton County Emergency Management Agency (AFCEMA) soon thereafter and then came to Tech about 10 years ago.

A daily schedule is hard to define.  We responded to incidents and accidents across the area of operation.  Fortunately, near the end of our deployment, it was relatively calm.  There were long periods of looking for work, and other periods where you'd go a few days with little or no sleep.  The first part of the deployment was what you'd expect:  Little sleep and usually on the ground, intermittent meals, no showers for a month, and an ammo crate was your toilet.

comments,"&gt; “It’s part of a discussion, but it has to be part of an overall view  of what somebody is and what somebody has accomplished,” Sanders, who  is 77, told POLITICO. “Look, you’ve got people who are 50 years of age  who are not well, right? You’ve got people who are 90 years of age who  are going to work every day doing excellent work. And obviously, age is a  factor. But it depends on the overall health and well being of the  individual.” 

I do think he is old. Trump is also old, and in poorer physical health (which contributes to aging issues). Biden is old, Warren is old, Pelosi is old.

I try to always focus on the process, not the outcome.  A good outcome can be the result of dumb luck.  Likewise, a bad outcome can be from bad luck or tough circumstances.  We do know that good processes generally result in good outcomes.  So, that is where we focus.

We do conduct lots of exercises and drills to assess our preparedness.    When we do have incidents, we conduct what is called a ""hot wash"" and write an after action report.  From that, we usually edit existing plans or write new ones where gaps were discovered. ",negative,-0.9508,neutral,0.009541847041847051,02/22/2019

This doesn't come naturally (to most people); success at career fairs is a function of luck and how much practice you do w.r.t being able to articulate what you bring to the table and what you want to do at a company. If you want help with your resume, you might want to check out the communications center at the culc: [http://www.communicationcenter.gatech.edu/](http://www.communicationcenter.gatech.edu/). More importantly, just show your resume to friends and/or mentors and ask for feedback. People's opinions will vary pretty wildly but there's rarely a ""right answer"", just go with what highlights what makes you special. Tbh I found it helpful at career fairs to go talk to companies I wasn't as interested in first at career fairs so I could get into the groove and figure out how to sell myself, then go talk to the people offering your dream job.

comments,"In what way did you feel like it didn't go well? If you want I may be able to help. I've had my fair share of interviews and after a lot of bad times I finally found a way to showcase my skills. 

Employers want to see that you'll be able to help the company and that you could be a potential hire in the future. Try to make sure that your resume includes work that you've done, and make sure you have some room to talk about the projects you've completed. Anything that's on your resume you should be able to talk about and expand upon.

Research is extremely important. Figure out beforehand the companies that will be there. Figure out what they do, where that are located, and any buzzwords that seem to be important. The projects and objective statement on your resume may change depending on the kind of company you're applying to. 

After you do your research, start creating your elevator pitch. Figure out what qualities will distinguish you from every other resume the recruiter has seen. If there is anything on your resume that may be viewed negatively, (low GPA, no work experience, etc) make sure you know how to respond when it's brought up.  

Finally, this kind of thing just takes practice. The moat important thing you can do is to learn from your mistakes. It took me 4 semesters of career fairs to land an internship on my own. Over time, as you get better at talking with recruiters, you'll become more confident, which helps you even more. Also, understand that rejection is normal, even at a school like Tech. Letting it get to you will only hurt your situation even more, and you have to remain persistent if you want to land that internship.

comments,"As others have said, have a concise pitch about what you're interested in, projects you've worked on, and what you're looking for.  Doing research on the companies in advance and having a cursory knowledge of what they do helps immensely.  Have questions chambered so they can see you're interested.  

I've been recruiting at dozens of career fairs and the resumes I flag for interviews are the people whose conversations were engaging and can express why they're interested in our line of work.  At Tech, there are endless identical resumes with excellent grades and the same projects listed.  You are the difference.

And for fuck's sake know what went on in the projects on your resume. I just finished interviewing for an analytics/data science role and I got so many resumes saying ""did project to investigate factors related to length of hospital stay"" and I ask them to explain their findings (and how it would be useful to a hospital) and they can't at all draw conclusions and summarize the project.

comments,"This might get long, so bear with me.

To get proficient in organic chemistry, you have to do some things that no professor is going to tell you to do. You have to get so proficient with organic structures that recognizing implicit hydrogens becomes second nature. You have to “see underneath the surface” of structures and recognize general patterns. You’ll hear instructors tell you to do problems, sure. What you may not hear is *why*: the foundations need to become automatic. Only then can you start to recognize the higher-level patterns that occur across superficially different problems. The fact that you aren’t recognizing connections tells me that the foundations aren’t what I like to call “part of your being.”

Think about a basketball player. For a professional, the mechanics of shooting and dribbling are automatic. This opens up the mind to think about things like plays and formations. The latter is only possible because of the former. It’s no different in organic chemistry (or cooking, or chess, or mathematics, or biomedical engineering, or...). When you do tons and tons of problems, the goal is to make the basics so familiar that you can start seeing higher-level patterns on your own. This isn’t quite something you can just will your mind to do, but it does require mindful attention while studying and solving problems. Eventually, the magic will start to take hold...or, in spite of how you feel about the subject, you’ll make it through successfully.

comments,"I hated career fair literally up until my last semester (last Fall). I'm pretty introverted and being in that huge crowd made things rough.

That being said, one thing that really helped me when finding a job during this and during professional interviews was knowing my pitch. Basically just having a sum-up of my worthwhile qualities in around 90 seconds to dish out to potential employers. I think SGA did a thing on this at some point, but basically it's something like this: short intro (name, major, year), meaningful qualities (""my strengths are A, B, and C"" although you could list more, I'd say max of 5), relevant experience related to the job itself or those strengths you listed (research, personal projects, school projects, internships, etc), and then a small statement about why you're interested in the work at the company you're looking at. 

Just having some form of structure really helped a lot for me. Keeping it short and sweet also allowed the recruiter to ask many questions about you and made things go more smoothly. I also found that less people asked about my GPA immediately if I listed strengths and projects that were sought after by the company.

comments,"I think that knowing what you want is absolutely key in career fairs, that will lend itself to a better pitch. Recruiters want to figure out who they want to hire without too much bullshit, if you can concisely tell them what you want and how you'd be a valuable asset, then you'll eventually get something. As in ""Hey, I'm x and I'm interested in cybersecurity. I'm looking for an internship or maybe even a co-op."" That'll give them something to work with quickly, a place to start asking you questions, etc. You can have a shitty fucking resume and as long as you can work the recruiters with the words, you'll be fine. I'd also advise to go for smaller companies at first too, your first job doesn't have to be at some pretigious fucking FAANG company. You can still build your resume without them. My resume is super plain and wasn't that great as a freshman, but my first summer of college I was working at a high-paying co-op. Hell, I'm still working there now and I'll have like 3 years experience by the time I'm out of school. It's doable with the right approach.

As for the loneliness part, I have some different opinions: I do feel I can be more focused when being alone, which is good for me now since I have too much to do at this point(literally working for 60+ hours per week).
 Also, after all, we come to this world with no one and will leave this world with no one. So I guess loneliness is essentially a part of being a human. Getting used to it is not necessarily a bad thing.

The next semester I decided to rush a fraternity. I met a bunch of people a lot like me and I managed well for the next 4 years.

What I suggest is going out and seeking people who have similar ideas and behaviors you enjoy. I am not saying greek life is right for you, it may not be. (don't let prejudices say no). I suggest you start doing something you like to do but in a social setting. 

Loneliness is hard because you want to be a part of something but the best cure to loneliness is a constant effort in finding people to associate with. Tech is full of people just like you, you have to go out and find them because ironically, they are all a little socially scared as well.

Suggestions I have, join a club (I looked into tech music which was at the time called under the couch) or a few firends of mine were in GT racing/motorsports. Explore greek life, there are a handful of houses that break the ""Frat"" stereotype. If you are a religious person, there are a number of spiritual orgs on campus.

The only thing I can't really offer advice on is the counseling side of things. But I do offer you an opportunity to PM me if you feel like you need advice. I graduated tech 8 years ago now so I may not be completely in tune with student lifestyles and issue but I may be able to offer at a minimum an ear to listen. 

the problem with Tech is that by it's educational nature, it invites a lot of loners. We all need social lives even if we prefer to be introverted. I wish you well OP.",positive,0.857,positive,0.10688492063492064,02/23/2019

As far as your resume is concerned...
There r many resources at tech. you may meet up with your career advisor(the building to the west of tech tower) or scheduke an appointment with them... they are very helpful and very knowledgeable. You can express your concerns to them, they tell you what to write and what not to write.

The undergrad offices for EAS (Earth and Atmospheric Sciences)  and ChBE (Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering) are on the main entry level on opposite sides of the atrium. There’s a few other schools in the building, but those are the big two people turn things into since they’re right there.

If custodial services picked up the jacket, they’d probably take it to Ford Facilities: you can take the elevator on ChBE’s side down to L2, and then go straight ahead through the double doors. Ford Facilities is the last office on the right before the loading docks.

You’ll need to check during the week, since the building’s officially closed on the weekends, unfortunately!

And if none of those points have it, you can also check with GTPD as the catch-all campus lost and found.

comments,"I know this is a meme, but I'll take the opportunity to share a little knowledge. Many devices, phones especially, have a tendency to be ""sticky"" when connecting to wireless networks. What this means is once the device connects to one access point (similar to a wireless router that you'd have at home), it'll stay connected to it even if you walk closer to another one at a higher signal level.

When you walk outside of a building, your phone is staying associated to whichever AP it associated with last inside. The signal is just strong enough to associate, but not strong enough to pass any meaningful amount of data. Especially with glass doors and the various materials that make up exterior walls, the signal deteriorates significantly in that short distance.

If anyone's interested in more detail, there's a [very detailed paper](https://www.am1.us/wp-content/uploads/Documents/E10589_Propagation_Losses_2_and_5GHz.pdf) that discusses the propagation losses of both 2.4GHz and 5GHz signal through common building materials.

More simply put, here's a table:


Material | Signal Attenuation
--------|------------------
Glass Window | 2 db
Wood Door | 3 db
Cubicle | 3-5 db
Plasterboard Wall | 3 db
Drywall | 4 db
Cinderblock | 5 db
Marble | 5 db
Glass Wall / Metal Frame | 6 db
Brick Wall | 8 db
Concrete Wall | 10-15 db

These aren't universal or perfect - every material and environment is a little different which will yield different results. What matters is that every 3 db of attenuation will cause about 50% signal loss. Once you are outside with a door (or two) and a brick/concrete wall between you and the AP, the signal is basically useless. At 10db (so one concrete wall or so), you lose 90% of signal strength which I could see being just enough to pass enough frames to maintain an association, but not pass any actual traffic.",positive,0.8626,positive,0.10990196078431373,02/24/2019

comments,"Hi, I was in Challenge, and I would say it was really worth it. You only know it was fun after you complete the challenge.

The point of the Challenge program is to show hell and to make friends out of it. So they squish 2/3 worth of a semester content into 5 weeks of classes. It's to make sure you get out of the high school mindset and to torture you to make sure you can become productive during the actual fall semester. The point is to fail the fuck out of you so you won't be fucked during the real semester (the courses during challenge don't count for credit). You will find what a lack of free time feels like.

They make you take CS1371,Calc 1/2, and CHEM1310/1211k, which are core classes for most majors. It makes your first semester easy since you've already seen content from it.

You also get to build your career profile by learning how to make resumes for jobs, and you will have mock interviews by sponsor companies for tips. And the whitewater rafting was fun.

From people I've heard from Ignite, it's pretty much like a summer semester. You choose a few classes you wish to take, which counts directly towards your semester. The only difference is Ignite should also have a few programs to support your success there.

However, there are tons of people who come from **much** more religious households, who considered their faith an integral part of their identity. For them, the transition can be quite jarring. Furthermore, people may face moderate to severe backlash from their families.

comments,"If you are just starting your career as a software engineer, both Raytheon and Lockheed would offer similar experiences.  I personally think it is a good starting point for a software engineer.  They will train you to be a discipline engineer.  The reason is both companies are CMMI certified.  That translate to rigorous software design process that requires peer review with all stakeholders throughout the whole software development cycle.

The process sometime can be tideous and time consuming but it will train you to have the right mindset as an engineer and you can carry over those valuable skillsets when you switch job later on.

They also offer tuition reimbursement if you want to get a master's degree or PHD as long as it is applicable to your field.  I got my master degree for free.

On the technology side, it really depends on your project.  Some could be legacy system but there are definitely some cutting edge stuffs.  Again, that all depends on what you get assigned to.  I wouldn't worry much about it.  There is no strict policy but I would say work a year or two on the project that was assigned to you but if you don't like it then you can check the internal career site to see what other positions you are interested.  Good thing about big companies not just Raytheon or Lockheed is that the company is big, you can do internal transfer or even relocate to different site fairly easily although you still need to go through some form of interview but it will be less formal.

The way to energize the fan base is to win. The best way to grow a fan base outside of winning is to spread awareness and using national TV games is a great way to do that. Remember, recruits aren't generally fans of the teams they sign for and aren't watching every Saturday.

You sure about that? 

&gt;The city of Atlanta goes hand-in-hand with the brand of Georgia Tech football, so taking advantage of the opportunity to play in Atlanta’s premier sports venue on an annual basis is a great development for our program. Being able to play the majority of our home games in the greatest setting in all of college football, Bobby Dodd Stadium, while also having the opportunity to showcase our program in one of the finest facilities in the entire world – located just nine-tenths of a mile from our campus – each season is a win-win and will be a unique feature of Georgia Tech football. It will be great motivation for our team, exciting for our fans and a great selling point for recruits to play on a stage as big as Mercedes-Benz Stadium.”

Except students don't always show up even when the game is at Bobby Dodd. The south end zone is a joke now where as 10 years ago for big games it would be full. 

&gt;We’re trading home games for neutral site games where we will likely be outnumbered by opposing fan bases. We saw it happen against UT and they pull less than Clemson and ND.  

That's assuming the team doesn't start winning. When GT is winning people show up. It may not happen in 2020 but by 2025 if Collins is doing what he said he would then it shouldn't matter. And it appears that if it's not the CFA kickoff it will be be a home game that GT controls so opposing teams won't get huge allotments like a neutral site. It's our own fault if our fans don't buy tickets.
 
&gt;he venue doesn’t have anything to do with national TV contracts - ESPN will pick up our games if the matchup is favorable that week regardless.

CFA kick off, which at least 1 of these games is, is different than a regular ACC game. The fact that there will be 70,000 people at the game is a selling point for ESPN to select our game as a prime time game. 

&gt;Of course Stansbury has to justify it with the fans, but it is 100% a cash grab. 

If you want to compete with UGA and Clemson you need money. 2016-2017 GT took in $81.7M in revenue. UGA had $157.8M and Clemson had $112.6M. These are not even playing fields, schools with more money have an advantage. ",positive,0.9052,neutral,0.017499999999999988,02/26/2019

Once you get to a job, you can't just delay deadlines because you have a lot of work. I work in defense aviation, and just two weeks ago I had these two big projects that were being presented to the Navy on Thursday. Monday morning I got a phone call from fleet support that there was an issue with an aircraft. I ended up working an 83hr week because I'm not gonna put Marines' lives at risk, and I'm not passing up the opportunity for future contracts for my company.

That being said: there are certain situations where reneging is the correct move for you. Based on your flair it seems like you're on track to graduate this year, and since you're talking about internships, presumably you're graduating in the fall. If you're already deadset on grad school and a Ph. D program (read: you've already started the application and interview process) then the research opportunity may be more beneficial provided you're doing research in the field you're trying to pursue in higher learning. If you're not dead-set and you haven't interned multiple times before, i'd urge you to take the internship. A huge amount of my post graduate career was shaped by my internships at tech and realizing what i did and didnt want to do, based on working in a real world environment on teams doing what I thought i wanted to do.

Do they get the waiver but not the person with 3? Should we appoint a committee to determine what qualifies someone as having too many major assignments?

However, here's the best advice I can give past that point of initial instruction: the greatest resources for preparing for tests were the provided past tests.

It's all about the optics.

A lot of organizations are having to take a hard look at their traditions and actions as hazing becomes a bigger public issue. I'm in the marching band, and we've had to face this too. Plenty of bands have had huge hazing scandals that got them shut down. You have to consider not only the content of your traditions and group activities, but the public perceptions of them too.

It's easier to find navy colored clothes, it's more flattering figure wise, and tech gold looks awful with my skin tone. I can only imagine how hard it'd be to find professional gold clothing for an alumni event or something. It's way less neutral than dark navy so each item of clothing can't be worn as often. Gold also stains easier which isn't ideal for athlete uniforms. Plus gold and white don't provide as much contrast on uniforms that are most often viewed from a distance. Blue pigment is less likely to fade over time with sun exposure because of something to do with the reflected wavelength of light.

[The news broke yesterday](https://www.ajc.com/sports/college/georgia-tech-women-basketball-coach-placed-leave-over-personnel-matter/VpCjpzcjD9S2v8BIU1XHiO/) that Tech had placed women's basketball coach MaChelle Joseph on leave without really giving any information why except that it was “a pending personnel matter.” Today's update reveals that apparently not even Joseph, her agent, or her attorney have been told why, either:

&gt; The statement from Lisa J. Banks, Joseph’s attorney, said that the school “has failed to provide any explanation to Coach Joseph, her agent, or her lawyers, despite repeated requests, we are left to conclude that this is the latest, and most serious, action in a string of ongoing retaliation that she has suffered for raising concerns about gender equity issues in the Athletic Department.”

This is an especially bad time for this to happen, because it's a critical juncture before the NCAA tournament, and the team has been doing well this season. I hope we get some real answers soon, because something screwy is definitely going on. The AJC has filed an Open Records request for Joseph's personnel file, but the school has 90 days in which to answer it.",negative,-0.7631,negative,-0.05388888888888889,02/28/2019

comments,"You pay in the state you earned in. If you didn't earn in Georgia this year you have nothing to file with them, maybe capitol gains if you're claiming Georgia residency but I doubt you're a high enough earner, or Georgia will care, or maybe you don't have any cap gains for this year.

Anyway, if the state doesn't have an income tax you shouldn't have to file a return with them:
 [""Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming don't have income tax. If you're a resident of one of these states, you don't need to file a return in that state.""](https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/3932515-my-w2-has-no-info-for-fl-state-tax-do-i-just-leave-the-boxes-blank) In this case you have residency for the time you were living and earning there.

I've had to deal with this the past few years by living here in Georgia, having my ""residency"" be with my parents in Florida since I'm a student and earning all my wages in California. In my case I use Florida as my home address because no capitol gains taxes, and filled a non-resident tax return with California so they'd only tax the income earned there, instead of everything. The only part that's different for you is not having to file a return in the state your internship was in. 

So lucky you, you only have to deal with federal taxes. r/personalfinance is a better place to ask these questions, and there are a million threads with this exact question that have answers for whatever else may come up. So search around and look through their FAQs, which are full of everything else you'll want to know about money, like what you should do with all your internship earnings to get the best return.

As an aside, it only gets messy if you're commuting from a different state for work and have to file non-resident state returns to get the taxes lowered in your home state. Only a handful of states have these arrangements, like NY, NJ, CT, because the taxes the commuters pay to NYS get deducted from their NJ taxes, for example.",positive,0.9722,positive,0.08385964912280701,02/28/2019

I may be best if we put aside the idea of ""responsibility"" and instead reflect on what provides the best outcomes for students.
