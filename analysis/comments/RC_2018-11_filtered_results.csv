If you have any specific feedback (certain foods you would like to see added, food being low quality, running out of food in dining halls, etc.), we would love to hear it as there aren't many changes we can make or bring up to administrators based on general statements.

Goodno strictly follows the textbook (after all, he wrote it), records his lectures, and (as far as I know) doesn't teach at 8am. Covers more material and does so more formally, and unless this stuff is really interesting to you, his course is rather dull. Probably your best bet if you've got a dedicated structural analysis course ahead of you, or if you're a chronic skipper / are the kind of person who would be late to your own wedding if it were at 8am.

Jacobs does not follow the Goodno textbook (and often does his own thing notation/style-wise) althoug he uses it for his homework; can be a bit more scattered than Goodno, but often teaches a relatively easy course; almost always teaches at 8am; and has a lot of energy / is a funny, charismatic guy.

The majority of researchers and demographers start the generation in the early 1980s, with some ending the generation in the mid-1990s. Australia's McCrindle Research[26] uses 1980–1994 as Generation Y birth years. A 2013 PricewaterhouseCoopers[27] report used 1980 to 1995. Gallup Inc.,[28][29][30] and MSW Research[31] use 1980–1996. Ernst and Young uses 1981–1996.[32]

A 2018 report from Pew Research Center defines millennials as born from 1981 to 1996, choosing these dates for ""key political, economic and social factors"", including September 11th terrorist attacks. This range makes Millennials 5 to 20 years old at the time of the attacks so ""old enough to comprehend the historical significance.""

I definitely pull a lot of strings for students that make an effort to get to know me each semester and also ask me questions about work. Bribe us with food. We love food.

In all seriousness, yeah TAing such a huge class can spread us really thin, but the deadlock really comes around to not leveraging your questions more than others due to just weighing the question against other questions being asked. If I personally think the question can encompass a lot of material, I will answer it during recitation or office hours.

As a student, I make sure to ask TAs for office hours outside of their usual schedule and compensate them for it with a treat or small gift. Students do the same to me. You just sometimes have to go above and beyond for the bigger classes to get their attention. If you try hard enough to reach them, you WILL get a hold of them and get the time you need.

Sometimes, shit takes a long time to grade because school and other grading we are already behind on... it sucks but from my PoV it happens. I typically put TAing before school so that it doesn't happen to the section I'm responsible for.

But, FYI, tech has a great liberal arts program as well; economics, political science, public policy.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the behavior you're describing sounds extremely inappropriate and unethical for a TA.

1) Accepting bribes of food or small gifts constitutes a fairly significant conflict of interest.

2) ""Pulling strings"" for certain students undermines the consistency (and therefore the fairness) in the treatment of all students. I'm unsure exactly what you mean by this, but I don't like the implication.

3) Holding private office hours for certain students gives those students an unfair advantage. If you are holding extra office hours (or making that option available), this information should be made known to the rest of the class so that other students can take advantage of the opportunity. Of course there are sometimes exceptional circumstances, but there needs to be a protocol in place for this that students are aware of.

comments,"I""m a TA too and just know sometimes the communication isn't amazing through us. You don't know how many questions you guys ask that the professor (and us) didn't think would come up so we didn't come up with a solution. This means a lot of thinking on our feet/ taking time to clear a response with someone higher up (you'd be surprised how out of the box some of the questions are). Also, don't waste our time with dumb questions, read the syllabus, read the textbook, ask a friend, post on piazza, google it ect. It's harder for us to help you if we are busy sorting through a million emails and questions that are easily answered. If you are having serious trouble in a class, email us and try to get additional help, don't just complain about office hours ect especially if you know they tend to be busy.  Most of us can and do host ""1 on 1"" meetings (if arranged beforehand, especially if you can't get attention at office hours, and **especially** if it is about grades). We make ourselves available in addition to set office hours to help you the best we can, and to provide privacy when it comes to grading matters. 

As far as grading is concerned we usually have grading deadlines. Sometimes professors want to check grades on assignments themselves, sometimes we have to wait until EVERY project/exam is turned in before grading (including make-up exams/ extended deadlines). There are other delays beyond the number of TA's.",positive,0.955,positive,0.11818181818181821,11/02/2018

I know there's a BME program in Ireland, and lots of people go to Lorraine and love it (stop making me jealous guyzzz).  As an ME, I chose Tech because I knew I could do anything with engineering here (as opposed to a well-rounded state school) and it was a few hours from home.  

I know Tech's BME program is great, the biotech buildings are pretty, campus has a nice feel despite being in the middle of the city, and we have sports and Greek Life if you're into it (or it's not in your face if you're not).  Also if you like STEM, Business, public policy, or design, Tech has majors you could switch to.

I'd say visit the colleges you're interested in, and pay close attention to what they say about pre-med and other things you're interested in.  College visits are good to see prospective schools as more than words in a pamphlet or webpage.  I'm not familiar with med school admissions or where pre-med Tech students end up.

MSG intolerances are psychosomatic so very annoying.  The study 40 or 50 years ago was done so terribly.  As Anthony Bourdain would say it was racism that caused this issue.

5) Do these readers work with our existing system? How much investment would it take from us to integrate these into our system?

I’d say the big thing thing to consider is your overall career/skills development. Will you be working on new projects? Learning new skills? Seeing a different part of the business? If not it may be better to jump ship and take the better offer. I regret going back for my internship, I was basically doing entry level+ work for them at intern pay and didn’t learn much new. Going to another company definitely would have helped my resume and give me a different learning experience.

A very rare constellation of chaos that led to the approval. 

It's very hard though, but can be done. The registrar won't do anything for you at this point. You need to petition the undergraduate committee which meets once a month.

comments,"I had it with Klein, (granted back in like 2012), and I found it fairly enjoyable. It focused heavily on bias, propaganda, and how our media and government can ""massage"" or straight up twist the truth to push a given narrative. The goal of the class was to encourage us to be more willing to consider other/opposing viewpoints and not just blindly consume media without giving some critical thought to any possible spin. Best part is he managed to cover this without any real leaning to the left OR to the right.

He also brought in a hardcore/radical vegan activist (lol) to talk to us, primarily as part of the whole ""consider and weigh viewpoints you may not necessarily agree with"" bit. It actually did convince me to try going vegan for a couple of weeks. (I hated it ahaha). 

The main downside was that the reading assignments could be fairly time consuming. Lots of news articles, excerpts from Plato's ""The Cave"", plus we had to read ""Affluenza"" and ""Brave New World"" among other smaller books. Fortunately BNW is a favorite of mine so I'd already read and re-read it a few times so I got to save some time there.

Also there were a couple (I think 3 max) of short research papers/essays I had to write, no real big deal with those though.

It's a pretty easy class, just a little potentially time consuming. So I'd definitely recommend it, but only if you have time in your schedule for a fair bit of extra reading. ",positive,0.9528,positive,0.15921994671994674,11/03/2018

1) I am glad that we somehow pulled this out. It looked pretty bad for a little while and we had some nice big plays towards the end of the game. Glad our guys hung in there and fought till the end. Also means we stand a decent chance of getting to a bowl game which will be nice to see again.

2) That said, this was an ugly-ass win. UNC is just not a good football team and we played right on their level. Even with this win, it's hard to take our team seriously when we perform like this.

3) I said this in another thread, but CPJ isn't going anywhere. Do with that whatever you will but the fact is it's really hard to justify getting rid of him when he's about to oversee a return to a bowl game and our financial situation is the way it is.

4) Please. Please. Please. Just please can we have a night game next week?

While I’m not trying to dismiss UNC’s well-deserved spot in the coastal division, I’m tired of the excuses we make whenever we struggle against an opponent that’s at or near the bottom of their division. 

I hate that I’m going to give Clemson credit here, but when a team like Clemson struggles against a team like Syracuse, they don’t try to chalk it up by saying “hey look, some other mediocre teams struggled against them too”. Instead, they strive for more than mediocrity by focusing on their remaining games, the mistakes that were made, and having ~~sketchy recruiting practices~~ greater concern for their athletes’ performance.",negative,-0.5216,neutral,-0.028409090909090908,11/03/2018

a.) NextBus will not spontaneously cease working

b.) Bus arrival times will actually match the regular intervals given on the website (i.e. every 15 minutes for a trolley, as opposed to the actual 45-minutes you have to wait on the weekends)

c.) PTS will find some way to broadcast route changes that does not hijack a tiny little sign's text box for 45 seconds

comments,"I agree, the ""administrative funding"" excuse is an extremely lazy one. During the Duke game, you had major donors leaving at the end of the 3rd quarter. The reason we have such a mediocre budget is because of mediocre performance over the past 3 years. I don't think many people want to sustain this level of mediocrity, but even if you do, you need alumni donations to keep rolling in. The problem is, you can't receive donations when you have major donors walking out before the end of homecoming games. 

I'm also shocked at the inability of this *engineering* school to look at our athletic expenses and realize that the $2M it would take to fire Paul Johnson really isn't that significant in comparison to the amount of money already being spent on our athletic program. The math is just not that hard. If you think he's still just as capable of leading the types of teams we saw over 3-4 years ago, the argument you should be using is that the opportunity cost of firing him is greater than anything else, and that's including the $2M penalty. 

The justifications we apply to mediocre exam performance just can't keep being applied to athletic performance, because there's no little subjectivity in the latter. Whether or not we're at a point where the administration can't afford *not* to fire him is a tough question to answer, but I think we're rapidly approaching that point, especially if we don't pull out another win this season.

One particular agencies ranking doesn’t mean much on its own, but schools that consistently get ranked high have a reputation for being the best. And schools themselves brag about their rankings. There’s going to be people at every single college in the world who think they’re the best because they've been 'siloed', it’s not just some phenomenon that happens at elite schools, it’s just symptomatic of the fact that not everyone has a complete perspective of things. 

All that to say that it’s a bit shortsighted to just throw it out and say rankings don’t matter. They do - to what degree is subjective but they do. 

How can you justify your statement that GT is one of the best tech schools in the world? Without solid metrics it sounds to me like just a self-ingratiating statement, which is exactly what we don’t need. You're using the idea that GT is one of the best tech schools in the world as a qualifying statement, but there's no real evidence to back that up other than the same sense of pride that's bad for campus culture.

comments,"I'm from farther north John Creek and have been commuting for the past semester. If you're driving down after 10ish it's usually around a 45 minute drive on 400, but last semester I had a class at 10. I usually left 8:30-8:45 and took 141 down to 285 and then 85 and got there from 9:30-10. But 400 is a nightmare that early in the day. 

As for marta I've done that as well and it is pretty reliable. I would definitely recommend driving down to doraville though and not taking a bus. Parking is free and I've found that buses add SO much time to the commute. I went with a parking pass this semester though because I knew I'd be staying late at school a lot and wanted the convenience of being able to drive.

And I mean, I’m assuming too that the OP has also already taken the steps of downloading the program requirements, the student manual for their program, and looking at their course catalog and checking their degreeworks (though I hate that program because it’s broken af).

1. Core classes at Tech aren't too bad, it really depends on the professor, the class, and how much work you are willing to put in. 

2. I definitely had to work harder than my previous school.  Georgia Tech isn't one of the best schools around without making you work hard for your degree.  However, working harder means you can understand the material better.

3. I can't speak for Chemical Engineering, but ECE has student tutoring for every required course in our major, I'd be surprised if ChemE doesn't have something similar. There are also plenty of opportunities to go to Office Hours for your professor or TA.

&gt;I was wondering if I took my first science with lab this spring and the second in the sequence in Fall 2019, would that fulfill the requirement to be able to apply for spring 2020 or would it be best to take it in the summer? 

It will not. For spring you would have to have all credits completed, not in progress, as I believe they are due mid October. However, when applying for fall you just have to have your credits finished by June 1st, which is after the application deadline so that might be looking in to. 

&gt;alc 2 is not a requirement for business majors at my university but is a requirement for transfer to tech so I was wondering if business majors are required to take calc II at GA Tech?

Not a business major but if I remember correctly they have the same requirements as Ivan Allen students which is survey of calculus and finite math. However, there are a few options for math credit combinations you can do, one of which is calc 1+2 linear algebra. 'Finite Mathmatics' is a pretty Georgia Tech specific class, so since it is hard to get you typically have to take calc 1 and 2 to get in as a transfer, even though you don't necessarily need it for the major.

comments,"Congrats on being accepted! I just transferred in, and this is my first semester so I have a bit of a fresher perspective. 

1. I had all my core classes done, but from the freshmen/sophomores I’ve met, they’re not easy. But they’re doable. I’ll tie this in a bit more further on. 

2. I’ve had to completely rework the way I think about how I go about things. I’ve had to drop two classes so far, but it’s mostly do to the fact I wasn’t all the way ready for the way Tech works. 

Time management is key, because the classes tend to be more work than what their Credit hours say. 

And I’d also go to academic coaching if you don’t feel your study habits are all the way there yet, or if you just want to know how you can be more prepared. 

3. I’m pretty sure you can find tutoring from the school if you need it. If not from the ChemE department, than likely from one of the number of departments that are on campus. For core classes, there’s plenty. 

4. This biggest piece of advice is pretty cliche, but just reach out for help when you need it. Whatever it is. And speak to your professors. Some of them are gonna be weird, but some are the coolest people you’ll ever meet.

It's definitely not hard to find a spot as long as you show interest and reach out to professors. The internship/co-op program is also very good at GT and the CHBE department heavily encourages everyone to go to the career fair or the Clearinghouse (career fair with just CHBE companies). There's ample opportunities to network at the AICHE, Career Fair, and Clearinghouse.
2.  I have taken one CHBE course and I am currently taken two at the same time. It's definitely challenging and you will feel that from your first (CHBE 2100) class. A lot depends on the professor as well, but you have to come prepared as you will be exposed to something new. The most challenging classes everyone say are the trifecta (transport 2, separations, and kinetics).
3. I think what separates GT from other school is everyone has an open mindset. I speak that for the students and faculty. Like you mentioned biotech, there's a lot of biotech research within CHBE and there's also a separate biotech track for ones who want to pursue the field. The AICHE brings diverse group of companies so everyone can get exposure to what CHBE is about and the kind of work you can get in the future with a CHBE degree.
4. With a CHBE degree, you can literally work in any field. You can go into Process Engineering, R&amp;D operations, Supply Chain/Management, Project Engineering, Technical Sales, Consulting, Law (Patent), Wastewater, and many more. At the career fair, you can find all the companies that hire within the fields mentioned above, and that's the best about the versatility of a CHBE degree.

comments,"I'm not a TA, so I can't speak to exactly how they do it (not even sure I would publicly disclose it if I knew tbh). But I'll try to speculate.

So, code is nothing more than text files, so storing large amounts of it costs very very little. Now, obviously certain pieces of code are going to be the same across pretty much everyone's code (think simple getters/setters, simple constructors, etc). So, you can set your algorithm to ignore that kind of code that will be the same across everyone's code. But, what about other code? An obvious approach would be to do straight up text comparison (maybe trim all whitespace to a single space and then check it). This will catch the dumbest cheaters. But that can obviously be circumvented by changing variable names. We'll need a better way.

What is code when it comes down to execution, anyway? For the sake of time, let's just skip over the details and instead ask, what is code to a computer? Well, we know from our sufferings in CS 2110 and the like that code is just a set of instructions for hardware to do something. So, cheating detection will need to look at the structure of code, meaning what it actually does ignoring variable names or things like swapping if/else statements. This is the meat of cheating detection: looking at code based on what it does and in what order, not based on what labels people give it.

Once this is nice and automated, a candidate piece of code will be ran against a database of code, and a computer will spit out a number saying how much it matched other people's code. Above a defined threshold? Your code gets sent to a human to review the parts the software found that are similar. They'll decide whether or not to pursue cheating charges.

I don't know if we use it here, but Stanford's [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) (Measure Of Software Similarity) seems to be used by a lot of people.

But, it all comes down to a human's discretion. And humans are imperfect and going to miss a lot. Maybe it's similar, but the assignment is so relatively trivial that it's no surprise that people would have similar code. This problem is probably why so many people get away with it in the more intro classes.

That said, don't cheat.",negative,-0.9511,positive,0.12435090702947846,11/05/2018

Most lower-level CS classes have over 200 students. Even if we lowball and say we're only going to check those 200 submissions against one another for potential plagiarism, that's *19,900* combinations of 2 unique submissions that have to be checked. In a class with 10 to 20 TAs (typical), that's between 1 and 2 thousand sets of files that have to be checked.

People use tools like MOSS not to accuse people of plagiarism, but to help them find out if there's even a possibility of plagiarism in the first place.

comments,"It absolutely is not a polygraph. It is a tested method of measuring the similarity of two pieces of software.

Finding the similarity in two pieces of software is just comparing the actions that they take independent of easily changed values like variable and function names.

When you compile code, you get a tree of statements that is agnostic of small differences in code structure (indentation length, variable names, etc). If those trees are similar, you can confidently say that the pieces of software which generated those trees are similar.

You then use this similarity as a basis for checking for plagiarism. You don't use it as evidence for plagiarism. You don't say if two pieces of software are similar it must be plagiarism. But you do use that heuristic to tell whether or not a piece of software is worth investigating.

Furthermore, we don't make wild accusations of plagiarism and we don't accuse people of plagiarism before we do an investigation. There's no record generated by a TA running student submissions through MOSS and then checking those which are similar. Nobody is going to get in any trouble just because MOSS flagged their code as similar.

No professor or TA is out to ""get"" a student for plagiarism.

I can understand skepticism, really, but this isn't a new or untested heuristic. Please see the following research papers for more information.

comments,"Precisely. The 1000-levels especially simply have too much code being submitted for the TAs to look for plagiarism just based on ""wait a second have I seen this before?"" by hand.

MOSS and similar software increases efficiency for finding those pieces of similar code, which will then be reviewed by hand just like it'd eventually be without this kind of software. Saying it's used to ""accuse people of plagiarism"" is ridiculous.

The instructors aren't stupid. If you're a student who makes all As on the tests, never loses any points on homeworks, and answers a ton of questions on Piazza, and your code gets flagged for plagiarism and it does everything correctly, they'll be able to see that it's not plagiarism.

Now, the guy who failed the tests so far and constantly loses a ton of points on homeworks suddenly turns in a homework that loses no points and gets flagged by MOSS for plagiarism? Based on that context and looking at the flagged pieces specifically, they can determine that is plagiarism.",positive,0.8632,neutral,-0.017708333333333312,11/05/2018

* **3670** is indeed the ez way out (and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that) and i'm sure the class itself has some merits as well
* **4581** is incredibly useful if you want to reduce your chances of hitting math bottlenecks in your higher level engineering classes (you'll be fine without it but a little more confident with it). Covers PDE's, Wave equation, Fourier series, things that are nice and mathy but also directly relevant to your classes.
* **4541** is what I took since it's relevant to my research, and I had a good time. It focuses on nonlinear systems of differential equations in higher dimensions (which it turns out is not *nearly* as bad as it sounds). Very useful for understanding eigenproblems and stability/periodicity in any dynamic system (think orbits). Prof. Zeng has a subtle sense of humor and is a good instructor if you can get him.

as far as I know none of these are taught online.

You're trying to say that it would be good for a black woman to win because a black woman has never been in this particular position before.  And you think that is important because it is bad for a society to be prejudiced against people based on their skin color or gender.  By having a black woman in this position, it represents a sort of cultural signal that society accepts that black women can be accepted in positions of authority.

But in making the argument that you should vote for a black woman because she is a black woman, you have reduced both candidates to their race and gender.  You have done precisely what you aim to fight against.  If someone said that you should vote for someone because he is a white male, you would correctly call that statement racist.

In terms of restrictions, you'll mostly have issues with CS 1331 since that's a prereq before you get the minor. However, each semester, you get to request a permit for one of the classes in your course outline, and two in your graduating semester. This permit doesn't guarantee a spot, but it allows you to register normally or add yourself to the waitlist.

My advice is not worry about it too much, try to have back ups for a couple courses. So if you wanna take those 4, have 2 others incase those are super full. Also look at the ones which are big bottlenecks in your degree and focus on getting those above all else. A course that doesn't lead to many others isn't nearly as important to knock out immediately as one that is a prereq for several of your major classes.

Also you should for sure be able to get into Tech 2000, since it's a class exclusively for transfers. ",positive,0.7485,positive,0.1889880952380952,11/07/2018

Attendance is required and checked by either a worksheet that we do in class, or a pop quiz that’s 2 short questions. They’re pretty easy though since 9 times out of 10, the questions are given to us on the lecture slides from the previous class (just worded a little differently). Your lowest quiz and worksheet grades are also dropped, so that’s also helpful if you miss one or just don’t do well. Aside from a final exam, we also have one midterm (which you get a study guide for), a short paper, and a group project. The project is more in-depth than the paper, but it’s also not too bad since you’re in a group with like 4 or 5 people. The professor is also very approachable, so if you ever feel like you’re struggling or don’t understand something, don't hesitate to talk to him.

It’s doable. If anything, you could replace 3710 or 1371 with a humanities or social science elective. They’re not prerequisites for as many things as Math and Dyamics. And 1770 is fun to take as a freshmen. I recommend Dorozhkin! Also Torello is great for Dynamics. 

I’ve posted before about when I took 1770 alongside 1371. They had the largest amounts of homework, and it was a constant cycle of chasing due dates. However, 1371 is unfortunately like that, and 1770 depends on how much detail you put in or if you have SolidWorks experience. Even though 1770 takes time, it’s an easy A or B if you do the work. I enjoyed it because I got to design things instead of doing busy work. 

I also took Dynamics and ECE 3710 together, and both required watching videos outside of class. The dynamics ones were much better quality, and there was higher accountability to watch them. Just keep that in mind. 

For Math, it depends on your professor and however many assignments you have. Don’t realize too late that you can’t bring your grade up because you thought there would be more quizzes.",positive,0.9781,positive,0.2215686274509804,11/07/2018

On the other hand, that’s not a lot of hours, so it would be manageable. Unfortunately, Tech is hard regardless, and you’d have to take those classes anyway. ",negative,-0.1308,neutral,-0.006144781144781151,11/07/2018

 with Karen (you won't know until the first class), a class usually goes like this

* She shows up, maybe on time, but she will be very upset if you aren't there on time.      
* Roll call, she asks you what you have for breakfast. If you ate a granola bar or some processed breakfast, lie. Tell her you had eggs and fruit or something.         
* You get out the sacred tennis balls and hydrate the fascia.        
* You may practice breathing, begin stretching, try meditating, annhilate your core muscles, or perfect yoga circuits.        

But no matter how angry Karen might be at you for eating a muffin for breakfast, showing up late, or not making enough noise when you exhale, you'll be sitting there. Stretching. Maybe relaxing.

It is possible for you to be in a graduate program and, with the permission of the (second) department, apply to have a second undergraduate degree program added.

&amp;#x200B;

From [Rule XIII, section F](http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/13/):

1. A student enrolled for a second undergraduate degree shall be classified as an undergraduate student, except that a graduate student wishing to pursue a second undergraduate degree will remain classified as a graduate student. A graduate student, with approval of the major school, may work toward a second undergraduate degree while pursuing a graduate program.
2. To be a candidate for a second undergraduate degree, a student must have the recommendation of the chair of the school concerned and the approval of the Undergraduate Institute Curriculum Committee.
3. To obtain a second undergraduate degree, a student must complete all major required courses for the degree and earn credit for a total of at least 36 credit hours in excess of the requirement for any previous degrees earned.
4. All items in [Regulation XIII, ""Undergraduate Degrees,""](http://www.catalog.gatech.edu/rules/13/) apply to students completing second undergraduate degrees.",positive,0.9477,neutral,0.04739583333333334,11/08/2018

Transfer students changing majors is generally discouraged, but in the end it is up to the discretion of the department you change into. CS is already an overpopulated major, so tbh your chances aren't great. You'd be a lower priority than any of the 1st/2nd years admitted as freshmen that want to change into CS.

Don't transfer as a major you wouldn't be content graduating as, because there's no guarantee you'll be able to change into what you want. Also, music technology isn't easy to get into, it requires a music composition portfolio

It also states provides GT’s definition of a shared walkway that bikes can be operated on as follows, “Any campus walkway space not immediately adjacent to a roadway, or walkway space immediately adjacent but wider than 5 feet.”

So any of the walkways in the center of campus are fair game (they are not directly adjacent to a road), and the walkways along the side of the roads that are wider than 5 feet.

If you're a cyclist, you should follow the same rules as a car - only be in a turn lane if you intend to turn and follow the same light signals that cars follow. And ofc if you intend to turn, use a turn lane (if there is one).  I'm guessing the sharrow is there to remind cars that cyclists turning left will use the left turn lane.

The general rule to keep in mind is that a bicycle is a vehicle on the road just like a car is, so cyclists are subject to the same laws and should behave the same as if they were driving.",positive,0.6777,neutral,0.0030303030303030346,11/08/2018

comments,"What kinds of things do you like to do? Tech is in the middle of, well, just about everything. Most of what I'm mentioning is within a 1-to-2-mile walk of the stadium (easily walkable, IMO).

Touristy stuff (a lot already mentioned here):

* Aquarium
* CFB Hall of Fame
* World of Coke
* Center for Civil &amp; Human Rights
* Centennial Olympic Park
* Piedmont Park
* High Museum of Art
* Atlanta Botanical Gardens (maybe a bit too far to walk)

Restaurants (generic, close to campus):

* Der Biergarten is German food right next to the CFB HOF.
* Cypress Street Pint &amp; Plate is my go-to for food on/right next to Tech's campus.
* The Varsity may also fall under touristy stuff.
* Marietta Street Corridor west of campus has some of the most interesting food spots close by. I find the Midtown restaurants to be, on the whole, rather drab.

If you're into beer like I am:

* Three brewpubs within walking distance of campus (ordered by my preference): Max Lagers, Torched Hop, 5 Seasons
* Cypress Street P&amp;P has a great selection of beer.
* Breweries within a short Uber ride: Atlanta Brewing Company, Monday Night, Second Self, Sweetwater, Orpheus

Late night stuff:

* One of my favorite things to do is a live-band karaoke called Metalsome. It's in the Virginia-Highlands at the Ten High, about 3 miles east of Tech, so I recommend taking an Uber. That's also a great place to go bar hopping.
* There are tons of music venues in and around Midtown/Downtown as well as comedy clubs. Depending on your tastes there's probably something going on that you could see.

Other stuff:

* There's some neat architecture and history around campus. Walk up and down Peachtree from its northern intersection with Spring Street all the way downtown. There are drastic changes in building types. It's really fun to see. Plenty places to pop in, too.
* Midtown has a bit of a dearth of sports bars if you want to catch other games. Max Lagers (especially upstairs) and Cypress Street are my preferred places to go close to campus.
* Tech as a really gorgeous campus. I recommend taking some time to check it out.

Her classes aren’t necessarily lectures, you’ll be expected to partake in classroom discussions in class. A lot of the class is her talking about something and then asking for opinions on it. 

I’d recommend her, she throws in extra credit assignments on the occasion and has pushed back some due dates for us. Idk if there are easier professors tho",positive,0.9313,positive,0.0659090909090909,11/10/2018
comments,"My advice would just be to watch a few popular mens fashion youtubers. Honestly business causal is probably the easiest aesthetic to master. First find out what ""body type"" you are i.e. skinny, athletic, or large then watch videos and read articles on how to dress for this body type. The biggest rule of mens fashion is that fit basically trumps everything else so it's very important your clothes fit you properly. Most younger people in the workforce should probably shop at stores like j crew or banana republic. Topman, zara, and h&amp;m might work as well but these stores lean a bit more towards fast fashion and might be to loud for a business environment. Another tip would just be to look at photo albums that people post on the mens fashion subreddits and  start off by trying to emulate the look in the photos that you like. Remember to have fun with it though, the more you like the clothes you're in the more confident it makes you!",positive,0.9782,positive,0.3534873949579832,11/10/2018

It's an easy A, but every time you step into the class you will wish death upon yourself. Now it's not because there's a lot of work (because there isn't). It's because the class is so damn boring you'll want to blow your brains out. We're doing food literacy this semester, and I kid you not, I cannot tell you a single thing I've learned in this class (and I have a 100). This is hands down the worst class I'm taking.

I think my class might be the problem tbh, because there are those few kids that pretty much rephrase EXACTLY what the Mullen says to suck her off, and that makes it so much fucking worse.

Mullen: ""Guys, bla bla bla something about food literacy...""

Annoying asf student: ""oh so you mean bla bla bla?""

The online program is a bit easier to get into, and the degree they award you is exactly the same as the traditional program. Once you're in the online program, you have the option of applying to transfer to the in-person program. I actually did this and am glad I did it this way, as it allowed me to knock out most of my ""core"" courses for much less money (the online program costs roughly 1/3 as much as in-person).

1) Are your grades bad based on your expectations of what you should get or based on class averages?

2) Are you doing everything in your power to get help? Whether academically or mentally? 

As a 4th year chemE, I've gone a few semesters BARELY scraping by my classes with basically all C's. There are also semesters where I feel like I fail everything, only to realize I'm doing about average or even above average with the rest of the class. I know what it feels like to be above AND below the curve.

It might be late in the semester, but go talk to your professors. If you're really concerned, a lot of professors are lenient with finals. Even if it's not a total grade replacement, they'll often bump you up a letter grade if you show some improvement on the final.

Additionally, keep in mind: 1) It's OKAY to feel like this. I think every tech student has felt like they're failing everything at one point or another. 2) Make sure you actually evaluate your efforts to improve. Trying to study 8 hours more for a class, but not attending office hours or studying with peers might literally be pointless. Work smarter, not harder. 3) If you're genuinely working as smart as you can. If you're at every office hour, at every tutoring session, constantly studying with friends, and just NOTHING is working, it's okay to fail. Maybe a school transfer is in order. Maybe a major swap would ease your work load. Maybe you're taking too many credit hours. But things will be okay.

comments,"YIKE! 

For months, the BIRD and the LIME have been fighting it out until there is only one winner. Straight Outta Atlanta, who will rise to be the champion of the scooter gangs?

Well, unexpectedly, a THIRD gang arose out of nowhere. These were the PEDESTRIANS. These powerful nonsensical beasts would WAGER MONEY to ride on the backs of both the BIRDS and the LIMES solely for entertainment, oftentimes putting not only themselves but also the BIRD/LIME in danger! The BIRDs and LIMEs knew they must forget their differences and UNITE to take down the villainous pedestrian.  For once, the scooter gangs were no longer enemies but were a team working together to save the world as they knew it. 

The pedestrians didn’t like this. They continued kidnapping BIRDs and LIMEs from their nests in the morning, much to their families’ despair. Sometimes these PEDESTRIANS traded off who was going to be the bully. By the end of the day, all the BIRDS’ and LIMEs’ batteries would be completely drained, rendering them powerless compared to the unstoppable PEDESTRIAN! 

One day, a lonely pedestrian Timmy came across a dead BIRD lying on the ground. 

“This poor BIRD, I can’t believe we as PEDESTRIANS have begun to do so much harm to another species.  *cries* What can I do to rescue this poor BIRD and other dying BIRDs around the world?” thought Timmy. 

After much thought and experimentation, Timmy discovered one of the main features of the BIRDs: All you need is a small adapter and the BIRDs can be revived! 

Timmy’s mind slowly began to change and morph into a variety of ideas, but ultimately one idea surfaced: he could abuse the BIRDs and LIMEs everyday but it would be okay because they could just be recharged and given a new life each night! That would not only give the BIRDs and LIMEs a new life, but it would also make them completely controlled by the PEDESTRIANS! If a scooter misbehaved, all a pedestrian would have to do is cut the charger that night to teach a lesson. 

In a kinky way, the scooters liked this. They mistakenly realized PEDESTRIANS weren’t so bad after all. The BIRDs and LIMEs assumed that the pedestrians had their best interests in mind when really they were only using the scooters for personal gain. 

The BIRDs and LIMEs got bored of this very quickly and began to fight once more. They found each other to be so equally matched, well, until BIRD GANG showed up, that is. BIRD GANG consists of the 12 HANGRIEST birds in existence. These guys absolutely DEVOURED the LIMEs. 

BIRDs are Superior to LIMEs but PEDESTRIANS are superior to ALL.

comments,"&gt;Yes it is

No, it's not. You said:

&gt;&gt;Socialism and communism are singlehandedly responsible for more deaths and torturing of innocents than any other individual or movement in the history of the world.

World War II killed ~50 to 80 million people, and is generally agreed upon to have been primarily caused by fascists (Italy), imperialists (Japan), and fascist imperialist (Germany). This is of course massive simplified, but fascism is primarily anti-left and socialism is antifascist and anti-imperialist. Vietnam—a war fought against socialistic self-determination—cost about 1.3 million lives.

More to the point, though—over *3 million people* (half of them children under the age of 5) die of preventable diseases every year. Jeff Bezos has over 150,000,000,000 dollars. 

(Short digression—what would you do with a million dollars? How much could that improve your life; the lives of your family and friends, some of whom need help? [Every dot in this image represents **one million dollars**](https://i.imgur.com/iV51XUY.png) that Jeff Bezos has. It's actually missing about 231 dots, because 231 million dollars is literally a rounding error from making the grid square.)

Over ***10 million people die of starvation every year***. A third of them are *children under 5*. This could be solved *now*, but instead, billionaires horde their wealth so they can make more and we can have 2-day shipping. This is capitalism, whether you admit it or not.

There exists no metric by which you can beat the numbers accumulated here over the last two decades, even if you ignore all of the aforementioned wars and even if you are as ungenerous as possible in terms of counting deaths due to (or, as I'm sure you'd actually count, ""under"") socialism.

&gt; climate change is not a means of controlling the populace.

What?

1. I don't know where you got that from. Regardless,

2. Climate change could also have been solved, but corporations and the wealthy both hid studies condemning their profit-making endeavors *and* lobbied for the continued ability to destroy the planet's ecosystem.

3. There will be ~2 ***billion*** climate refugees by 2100. They will generally not be white. If you think that it's coincidental that we're stoking fear of the poor and the brown and the refugees while we simultaneously create billions of poor, brown refugees, then you really don't understand very much at all.",negative,-0.9816,positive,0.08252873563218391,11/13/2018

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse

People like to talk about soldiers' PTSD? Like 70% of Iraqi children were traumatized for life. There are about 5 million+ orphans in Iraq. (http://www.irinnews.org/feature/2007/07/16/traumatised-iraqi-children-suffer-psychological-damage)

Drawing a ""red line"" about chemical weapons in Syria? The U.S. used white phosphorous, a chemical weapon that causes birth defects in people, often in the Iraq war.

Also, the Iraq war caused an insane amount of sectarian violence in Iraq. ISIS was essentially birthed out of the foreign policy decision.

The Iraq War is the defining foreign policy disaster of the last thirty years in America.

Condoleezza Rice is not a poor woman. She'll be fine if she doesn't speak here. But there's no reason for us to validate and honor somebody who was responsible for so much death and violence in this world.

It's the easiest thing in the world to be apathetic. It's the easiest thing to not care, but it is the moral responsibility of every conscientious person to push for a more just and humane world. To the 200,000 Iraqi civilians that died, Condolezza Rice's and the Bush Administration's actions are not simply a matter of differing opinion. It's not a debate on a college stage in a safe country. 

It's a mortar shell coming into your living room and shattering your father and mother's skulls and killing your little brother or sister.

It's a pregnant woman being shot by special operators on faulty intelligence and then having the bullet dug out of her corpse in a coverup. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Khataba, this happened in Afghanistan, but I believe fairly serves to illustrate this point, especially as it happened during Rice's tenure as SoS. You may disagree.)

It's the gang rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl by US Forces. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmudiyah_rape_and_killings)

Another massacre, among many. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haditha_massacre)

There are real, flesh and blood consequences for foreign policy decisions made by the United States, especially for people in the Third World. Our dystopias, what we'd find in our ""Hunger Games"" movies, etc., is their everyday reality. And it's the people that we elect, that we put in power that are responsible for these things.

Now, Condolezza Rice isn't solely responsible for the situation in Iraq. Neither was George Bush, and neither was Dick Cheney. Neither was Paul Wolfowitz, or Donald Rumsfeld. Saddam Hussein WAS a genocidal dictator, a tyrant. But Iraq was relatively stable under him.

I can't hold Saddam Hussein accountable to anything, because, thank God, he's dead. I can't hold anybody in the Iraqi government who was corrupt or horrible accountable, because I don't live in Iraq. I can't hold the vile terrorists in ISIS, or al-Quaeda, or al-Nusra accountable, because I'm not in Iraq, and I don't have the capability to do so.

But I can remind Condolezza Rice of the human consequences of her actions, of the foreign policy that she, as the National Security Advisor and the Secretary of State was instrumental in forming. And I can remind her that she was responsible for the deaths of a lot of innocent people.

What advice can Condoleezza Rice give to the average Georgia Tech student who's graduating this fall? What moral authority does she have, what moral advice? The average Georgia Tech student hasn't destroyed an entire country, so each and every one of us that attend this school is better than her on that count. The average Georgia Tech student hasn't lied to the world, knowingly, about ""weapons of mass destruction"" to catalyze a war that would destroy the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, both in Iraq, and in America, and would essentially destroy the public image of the United States on a global scale to a point where it would take an entire generation to rebuild, so each and every one of us that attend this school is better than her on that count. The average Georgia Tech student hasn't advocated for $1.5+ trillion dollars of U.S. Military equipment to be left in Iraq (and now all those tanks are being taken by ISIS) and added that to the national debt, so each and every one of us is better than her on that count.

It's the easiest thing in the world to not care, but it'd sure be nice if somone did.",negative,-0.9828,positive,0.07115800865800866,11/13/2018

Academic dishonesty when widespread makes it impossible to succeed without cheating since college is inherently competitive. When people do better, standards are raised. So there needs to be real and permanent consequences when people cheat. If the consequences of cheating were no worse than failing or withdrawing from a class than how would that deter anyone?

Sure, OSI should probably make the process better so that it’s not as stressful for people who are wrongfully accused, but that is not the TA’s job.

Working on your weight/appearance is definitely a plus and great for initial attraction, but if you're looking for a relationship, I'd say one of the best ways is to just do something you love. There are countless clubs on campus with people who like to do the same things. Sharing a common interest makes for an easy conversation starter, and potential for a relationship. Just make sure you're talking about something you actually enjoy (in this case, faking it till you make it isn't really a thing). Something to think about as you continue your journey with weight loss (better start counting those calories!)

Also. Seriously. Don't talk about being short. Insecurity is a huge turn off. If a girl won't date you because you're short, you probably don't want to be dating them anyways.

The most important requirement for a potential date for me is not physical appearance but that they are someone I can have a not painfully awkward conversation with. I won’t lie - you probably won’t do as well on tinder or the like, but that certainly doesn’t mean you can’t find someone.

It’s great that you’re trying to get in shape, but honestly you should do it for yourself, not to impress girls. Confidence goes a long way, but you can be confident and also realize you aren’t perfect. I say this because you can always find find flaws in yourself no matter how much you workout, but you can’t let that prevent you from living your best life.

That being said, Georgia Tech instructors and teaching assistants are legally obligated to report any instance of academic dishonesty. If you were found to be plagiarizing or cheating, it is within every right of instructors to report you to OSI for further disciplinary action.

I would expect OSI to operate in a timely manner, but OSI making you anxious does nothing to lessen the fact that you are being referred to OSI for academic dishonesty. It must have been egregious enough to warrant a referral. Your tone of arrogance, incredulity, and moral superiority would certainly not help your case. Calling a TA ""puny"" because they reported you after you dropped does nothing to lessen the fact that the course administrators felt you broke the rules. My only concern would be if the TA did not approach you with these plagiarism claims and reported you directly to OSI. 

Enjoying destroying lives? Academic dishonesty is a conscious choice by the student. To blame others for your own moral failings and ineptitude casts a dark shadow on the entire Georgia Tech community. You did this to yourself. Trying to weasel out by blaming others does nothing to help your case.

Find some subjects or actions that draw you in and commit to them. Religion, service, research, development, etc. Be fit because it makes you strong, mobile, and useful. Women, and other men, are often attracted to people who have that sort of drive or focus. As you improve yourself, your odds improve too.

Then just sprinkle some social efforts in. Go to a community service event, or compete in a race of some sort, or go to a nearby party/concert. You'll get to meet people this way, and they'll hopefully be grinding in life as you are.

Don't go up to random girls. Unless you can manage to prove in &lt;5 seconds that you are attractive (this doesn't! mean! just! physically!) and not a creep, they will be weirded out and uncomfortable. It's much better to naturally meet someone (class, club, study group, sit next to them at an event, etc) and get to know them a bit before you ask them out. Is all you care about whether or not a girl is pretty? Successful, fulfilling relationships need to be built on a lot more than that. If you just want hookups, get a Tinder, put up recent and honest photos, and you can find plenty of pretty people to have sex with.

Yes, people will still consider you if you're not jacked and in fact overweight (and short). Not every woman wants a ripped 6' guy with an 8-pack who can flex his pecs individually. No shade to those guys, that takes an impressive amount of work, but just because it's all over Men's World doesn't mean it's what every women wants (see also: dad bod).

1. Just be social and make friends. Some of them will likely be girls. If among them is a girl who likes you and you like them, you’re off to a way better start than you’ll ever have going up to random girls. 

2. With the exception of fitness buddies and judgy assholes, nobody cares about your physique unless it’s either amazing or disgusting. Based on what you’ve said it’s probably a fair guess to say you’re far from either category. Coincidentally though, workout buddies are a thing, so maybe join some kind of physical activity group if you want to make some fitness friends.

3. If you’re going out just to get laid, you’re going out for all the wrong reasons. If you fail, you’ll lose self esteem and feel bad about yourself. If you succeed, you’ll probably find yourself no better off than before unless you make long term, meaningful relationships along the way; but typically people just deservedly make enemies and end up feeling even emptier than before. It’s kind of a lose-lose situation. Getting a dick wet seldom solves any problems, but it sure causes a fuckton of them. 

I understand that actually being social is often a tall order for people who make these posts. But guess what; if you want to reap the fruits of being social, you kind of have to be social. That’s how it works. So if you really want this, get your head out of your computer, your ass out of your dorm and go say hi to some people.

comments,"&gt;I don't have a lot of female friends

I'd honestly fix this before anything else. Not only are female friendships extremely rewarding in their own right, but you can get a kind of chain reaction going where you start to meet their female friends, and then friends of those friends, and eventually meet someone who will want to date you.

From the rest of your post I'd say yes, you do have a chance. I'm also fairly short (5'7"" with the right shoes), and my first girlfriend was 4 inches taller than me. What's vastly more important than height is being confident, interesting, kind, and well-groomed. By all means chase those gainz too, but don't try to substitute them for a good personality.

Also, because nobody else has said it, don't limit yourself to Tech when trying to date. There's Georgia State, SCAD, Emory, and many more colleges here to expand your dating pool into.",positive,0.992,positive,0.36607142857142855,11/14/2018

It’s clear you’re not quite socially adept (hence the autism joke) if you think you can just lift a little, approach random women and hope to get a date. You won’t get girls if you lift for them because you will give up when you don’t see results fast enough. You won’t get girls if you’re seeking them because if you’re posting on reddit for advice, you reek of desperation, and most women don’t like that.

I’m not good at talking to people, nor am I good at socializing. I know the extent of my disability and social abilities in what I learned through therapy and bitter social lessons where I was an autistic splerg. Lifting has helped me greatly in my life and my confidence and physique, but at the end of the day, I’m still autistic.

You should try just being a normal friendly person with interests and passions that you can talk about and relate to people. You have to change your mindset and build confidence for yourself, and maybe your social skills will improve enough to where you can talk to a woman and get a date without being creepy or desperate.

I thought it was a funny joke with a dash of truth, but clearly you’re the type to just get triggered instead of laughing things off (one of those things I learned from bitter social lessons).

The main content is loaded via javascript, which essentially makes the network requests and renders it as HTML. You can use a headless browser to request that page and let it run the javascript. Then you would have access to the full HTML DOM after the javascript is finished running. Scraping the website should be relatively easy then, it would just be HTML parsing.

For example, the `requests_html` python library allows you to request a webpage using headless Chromium, which means it will run the javascript. [Here's the relevant documentation](https://html.python-requests.org/#javascript-support)

But yeah, it'd be easy enough to draw down public data and put a negative spin on things if the raw data are as easily accessible as others have insinuated. Fortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case.

comments,"I did the interview a couple of years ago and got the job but didn't take it. Basically the format is that you and a bunch of other candidates go into a room and then the interviewing students ask each of you questions that a person on a tour might ask, and the candidates answer them down the line. Your job is to answer them in the way that you think a tour guide should (i.e. diplomatically, friendly, in a way that always makes Tech look good). They were typing on their laptops the whole time so it was kind of like I was talking to a wall during my answer but I assume they're taking diligent notes. Also before that, we had to present a speech on a topic of our choosing, so that was part 1 to the process.  

The interesting thing is that they throw curveball questions to some students, whether or not its intentional I'm not sure. Like 3 students in a row got a question to the effect of 'what is the Invention Studio like and what kinds of things can I do there?' and then I got hit with 'I've heard a lot about Tech's high suicide rate, can you talk about that and should I be scared for my kid?' And then you have to delicately dance around the issue while also acknowledging it which is kind of fun. I think my answer was something along the lines of 'it's true that there have been some high profile suicide cases here but the administration has been very hard at work with the student government here to address these issues and fund potential solutions.' An answer like that is great.  

I guess as far as advice, know as much Tech trivia as you can because it's important to inject random factoids into your answers (rankings, other Tech superlatives), and never in any way insinuate anything negative about this campus, even if the question is loaded. Also smile, act like you're carrying a conversation, and also just convey that you really like the school in general.

comments,"Yonsei has something called KLI, Korean Language Institute where you have korean class like 4(?) times a week and is really focused on growing your book smart korean skills. I'm not sure how well it compares in conversational skill, but any practice is good practice. Make sure you apply early / on time or they wont let you in 


Along with this, the hardest thing about yonsei is about who you surround yourself with. You'll meet a lot of outgoing and friendly exchange students, but I guarantee you'll rarely ever speak korean with them since they will all speak English. Finding koreans who will speak to you often in Korean can be difficult, as once they see you struggle to understand even a little bit they will switch to English. I didn't succeed in that aspect, as I mainly hung out with other exchange students.


The LBAT is a great experience though and will bring you up to speed, so don't worry too much about only being 1000 level when you go. You get as much out of language learning as you put into it. Try hellotalk for finding a langauge partner maybe? I recommend a person of the same sex though cuz a lot of people use it as dating app lol.


Also have fun, Korea is lit.

comments,"*Accepted?* 

Yes Spring of '19 applied to ISYE

*Numbers* 

Applied from Clayton State through REPP
4.0 Math and Science
3.85 REPP (English screwed me)
3.6 Cumulative (Humanities.....)

*Advice* 

GET TO KNOW YOUR ADVISOR!! 
I don't know about KSU but at Clayton State there is an REPP coordinator who was my advisor. Whenever my application was reviewed, GT emailed the coordinator and asked for her opinion of the students applying through the REPP. I think this was beneficial for me because 1 I knew my advisor really well and she wrote a solid paragraph for me and 2 the application didn't include a letter of recommendation but I essentially got one through my advisor. 

Apply for the summer maybe? I never applied for the fall semester but I'm pretty sure statistically the acceptance rate is lower in the fall compared to spring and summer. 

Make sure your essays are good and your Math and Science GPA is as high as possible. On the application there was a spot for a Communal Resumé that could help your application if you were involved in such things. 

But with all that said, if you have a 3.8  and apply through the REPP you'll be fine.

comments,"REPP is short for the Regents' Engineering Pathways Program and is a formal transfer program that is accepted by 5 schools in the state GT, UGA, Georgia Southern, Mercer, &amp; KSU. In short it's an accelerated path into tech. Meet a certain set of classes and you apply as an REPP student rather than general transfer thus increasing your chance of acceptance. GT has info about it on their website. To my recollection the classes for REPP and ISYE are English 1&amp;2, Calc I,II &amp; III, Linear Algebra, Physics I &amp; II, CS1301, and I think 2 lab sciences (Chem, bio, etc) Also your overall and math and science must be above a 3.3 to apply through the program, obviously higher than that is better.

I suppose it depends on your goals. If you're a premed or someone interested in applying to selective graduate programs, perhaps just take the F and try for an A next time around. After all, it probably won't delay your graduation by itself - however a D will tank your GPA more than you might expect.

If that isn't what you're aiming for, then just study your ass off and see if you can make a passing grade, since nobody wants to retake something for an entire second semester. ",negative,-0.3481,positive,0.10654761904761903,11/16/2018

&gt;Hey guys, I've never posted before but I wanted to share my thoughts before I graduate this Fall. Warning: Its gonna be a long post. It's mainly the experience I've gained during my time at Tech, but also some advice that I wish I knew beforehand. Some of it is common sense and has been said multiple times by other students and some are just my personal experiences/beliefs. Feel free to add on/disagree with the things I've mentioned

&gt;1) During your sophomore year, get to personally know the professors in your major from major classes you take. Go to their office hours and sometimes just talk to them(if you feel like you're doing well in the class, don't be shy to tell them that you'd appreciate a recom letter later on). whether you're applying for an internship, scholarship or grad school you'll definitely need those connections 

&gt;2) Try doing research, even for a semester. Find out whether it's your thing or not. You won't know if you don't like something until you try it out. Finding a research lab during your sophomore year is recommended because your courseload isn't as heavy. Plus, research experience looks good on your resume 

&gt;3) join an organization you're passionate about. Leadership/volunteering positions are really important for your resume and you'll regret not doing it 

&gt;3)Social life. I cannot emphasize this. When you graduate, you won't look back and think, oh I wish I studied more for that second semester physics test I had. Instead you'll be wishing you spent more time meeting people and making friends. However, I will say that socializing is easier at the beginning of every semester, so try to have as much fun as you can in the first few weeks because then the semester gets crazy. Also, try to make friends with people you usually wouldnt consider.Whether its a different race, religion, sexual orientation, etc., get out of your comfort zone and get to know people who are different than you. Some of my best friends are people who are very different than me but I couldnt be more grateful for having them in my life 

&gt;4) if youre still a freshman or sophomore, find a junior or senior in your major that you can ask class questions/registration questions. it'll make your life so much easier, trust me. 

&gt;5) dating. I know most people have mixed feeling about this one, but I'll state my personal opinion. I don't want to say avoid dating, but as a female, I noticed the guys I encountered at Tech didnt know what they want. Some didnt know how to talk to a girl, some were fuckboys or just wanted to ""hang out"", and some of the good guys were taken. If youre looking for something long term/serious, you can get lucky and find someone but generally most people at tech prioritize their academics and dont put in much effort into dating. Try your best not to get involved with guys in your classes (unless its getting near the end of the semester or you are SURE the guy is right for you) because if you do and things dont go well, youll have to see their face every week for the rest of the semester. so yeah.

&gt;6) grades. Remember that grades are important, but they don't define you. I know people with low gpa's who have gotten jobs and even gotten into grad schools they've wanted. A lot of the times a good recommendation letter can compensate for a low gpa. Also, don't let 4/5 years of your life determine what you'll be for the rest of your life. I know Tech can be very stressful, but remember, you are one of the people who got admitted to tech. You are smart, valuable and beautiful. Don't let grades get to you and mess with your mental health or give you anxiety. Tech is hard, but you're stronger than that and you'll manage. thats it guys.

&gt;I hope someone finds the info I gave useful and if you're also a senior feel free to add on to what I said. Hang in there guys, all of you are amazing and never let anything(esp grades) make you feel worthless or stupid. You got this!!!",positive,0.9991,positive,0.1335199004975124,11/17/2018

comments,"A few things to keep in mind:

* If your final exam grade is higher than any of your midterm grades, then your lowest midterm will count for 7.5% of your grade and the final exam will count for 37.5% of your overall grade. Therefore, make sure you're weighting it like this: 5% HW, 5% Participation, 15% Quizzes, 15% Highest midterm grade, 15% 2nd highest midterm grade, 7.5% Lowest midterm grade, 37.5% Final 

* There will be some sort of curve at the end. I used a 3 point curve as a conservative estimate when calculating what I need today.

* It's a 2 credit hour class. Make sure that if you bust your ass studying for this exam, it's not to the detriment of your 3 and 4 credit hour classes. Getting a B in a 4 credit hour class is sorta like getting a C in a 2 credit hour class.",positive,0.8519,positive,0.11666666666666667,11/17/2018

comments,"Correct, the MicMan position is under the Cheer team and has not been on campus since the mid 80s. The previous Cheer Head Coach decided last year to bring it back and hosted tryouts. Knowing members of the cheer team, they encouraged me to come try out. I did and was given the MicMan position to bring back and make into something that will carry on for years. (I happen to be in \*Reck Club but am unaffiliated during all sporting events and go out of my way to keep it as such.)  I am actually currently reaching out to previous MicMen to get their takes on the position and enrich GT History and Tradition even further. (It is proving harder than I thought to find these people.) Next season will be my last and I, in conjunction with the Cheer Team, will be hosting tryouts to bring in a new MicMan. If you would like to try out for the position you are more than welcome to come and change the position to what you think it should be. Especially if you feel I am doing it poorly. I have included just a few of the position responsibilities below. Given that the position is still growing, the reach may go beyond all home football games. But all of this is still in the works so if you do come out to continue in the position you will be taking on a position that is not fully solidified and is still growing as it pertains to its requirements and responsibilities. 

\----------------------------------------

MicMan Position Responsibilities:

\- Lead Yellow Jacket Alley, The Cheer Team, and Goldrush in cheers 

\-Lead Calloway Plaza, The Cheer Team, and Goldrush in cheers on the Steps before the Reck rounds the corner into Bobby Dodd Stadium

\-Talk with alumni throughout tailgates with GT Cheer, and walk around campus leading Fraternities, Sororities, Clubs and Alumni groups in cheers

\-Required to attend GT Cheer Mens lifts --- Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 5am each week

\-Attend practices for the first few months in each fall semester to get acquainted with the team and learn all new cheers and lead some ""game-day prep"" practices (T/TR 6-8:30)

\-More to come, will be working directly with the cheer head coach to flesh out more ideas and solidifications to the position. 

\----------------------------------------

In my eyes the MicMan position is about the students. I was not the one who asked for a stand or even a megaphone. I was given these things to help legitimize the position for years to come.  When I was in your shoes in swarm I was cheering my heart out just as you are and have not missed a home game since day one here at Tech. This position isn't about me, but about uniting swarm as one unit. 

(I actually don't go by my real name in the position, I go by Keith, a Cheer Team inside tradition you will become acquainted with in the role, to help separate the line of thinking that ""this guy is only out here for himself"" to being someone to help unify the student section as a whole and throw the energy y'all bring back to you) 

Yes y'all cheer, and yes the entirety of swarm is into the game better than most, but some are new to the school, and potentially new to this country, and don't know the traditions, cheers, movements, or nuances of game-day lore. That is what falls to me as MicMan. I want to take your energy and throw it back to y'all to help keep engagement up and excitement high! If I come across as micro-managing the section I am more than happy to take constructive criticisms to help make the position even better. I apologize directly to you ""coldFusionGuy"" if I have ruined your game-days, and anyone else for that matter. But I want to thank you for helping make mine so special. I love Swarm with all my heart and hate to see that what I have spent two years trying to bring back is not being received well. Help me make it something you enjoy and look forward to seeing each game-day. 

\----------------------------------------

As for the ""Raise the Ratio,"" I think it is awful to reduce the wonderful ladies that come to Tech to numbers. We want strong high achieving women to be here not just to raise the ratio but to do it because they love it and ""Cheer the Brave and Bold"" in the process. Plus changing the GT Fight Song is irreverent to tradition. Traditions that Cheer, Ramblin' Reck Club, MicMan, and many other organizations try to uphold as best they can. I am all for having more ladies at Tech, believe me these are rookie numbers we are working with, but let's not reduce these women to just raising the ""ratio"" but empowering each and every one, ladies and gentile-men alike, to stand with each of other, not as man or woman, but as GT students, as we ""Cheer the Brave and Bold"" together. Just food for thought. 

\----------------------------------------

I am so thankful for all you do Swarm, and I look forward to one last year. 

That is all

Best,

Second: you didn't offend me. To be honest, I owe you an apology. You're trying your hardest, and cheering your heart out. That's awesome. 
Third: as far as constructive criticism is concerned, I would ask around, and see what sticks. Honestly it can be hard to read a crowd. I can't offer any magic solutions. But I can apologize for being kind of a dick when you're trying and cheering like the rest of us. I'm sorry for that.

comments,"I was a good test taker coming into Tech but definitely struggled with anxiety during stressful times. For me I found that listening to some calming music for a song or two before something big helped me a lot. I tend to keep some music playing in my head, and fortunately can largely keep calm by doing that. A lot of people have different ways of doing that; hopefully you can find your own.

As for the exam; I recommend reading the entire thing first. Do the parts that you know can get you the most points first, and keep moving as such. And try not to stress too much, in my experience most exams here are deliberately hard and usually almost nobody can do very well on them (depends on the class but this is what I’ve seen the most). You don’t need to do amazing, you just want to get as many points as you can. 

Another tip: if you struggle with time but generally know the material; oftentimes you can write out the steps that you would take to solve a problem and get a lot of partial credit for it. This allows you to gather a lot of points without having to take the time to do all the tedious work. When you’ve put something for every question (excluding ones you’re completely lost on), then go into details and flesh out the work. 

In general, if you’re struggling with a class, you should talk to the professor and/or TA. Here they’re usually nice and will help give tips on how to deal with what you’re struggling with in the class. So you could ask them for advice on how to take the tests, what they’re looking for when they grade the exams, anything that can help you. Sometimes if you go over an exam they’ll even notice parts where you could’ve been given more points, and retroactively add them to your grade.

HOWEVER, at all three HS around me including the one I attended, Georgia Tech only looks at the top 10% of each class and disregards or conditionally admits those slightly outside, like myself. In other places that have fewer people finishing with credentials like yours, they can be a bit more lenient. I hope this helps in some way

I've known him since we were 10yrs old and we both moved to the US together(15 days apart coincidently). We are completely different people though. It's insane how different we are but we compliment each other rrealky well. 

I don't know how it happened but he basically started hanging out with the wrong people. Lot of drinking and partying. He started smoking weed a lot. And then he started doing some hard stuff. We were in different states so it is hard for me to trace the exact origin of his downward spiral but at the end of his first year, I knew something was wrong. He didn't get into the business school thread/program he was interested in. Another year went by. That year he started realizing he's going wrong somewhere. We would Skype a lot and he told me how he is unable to focus and is struggling with classes. I couldn't help him much other than give the generic focus and go to the library advice, I was on my own journey of self discovery.the following year we met in person and thats when I realized how bad things had gotten. He had failed out and moved to a community college. He was smoking weed all day, doing coke every other night. he failed 4/5 classes per semester. This was a really dark moment for me. I was beginning to kick butt in my life: getting stronger, winning awards, getting scholarships and overall making a place for myself in a new country and he was going down the shithole. My sister infact told me cut him off as he was gonna bring me down but I just couldn't. I don't have a ton of super close friends and he was the closest of them all. Super supportive and caring and overall nice guy. 

Recently, he moved to Atlanta and once my lease was up I moved in with him. He wanted me to help him. He has not smoked weed or done any coke since early this year. Still drinks a bit too often but I'm cutting it down. What worked for him was unmitigated discipline and extreme ownership. I am a big fan of Jocko willink and I kept feeding him a dose of Jocko every day. I am not perfect by any means, far from it, but I'm on a path to be who I want to be and I was able to set an example for him which worked. He's not as quick to get disciplined as I would like but he's trending in the right direction and that is a victory in my eyes.

Drugs destroyed his life. Completely. I have nothing against weed, alcohol or even the hard stuff. But you gotta learn when and where to draw the line. And he failed at that. So, I advice my friends to NEVER get involved with that stuff unless they are sure it wont take them off the path they want to be on. Hes not struggling with drugs now : the line has been drawn and everyday it is enforced less by the dominating and straight edge friend  but more by the self determined and driven victim. I am pleased to inform he has also started dabbling around with waking up early and going to the gym. Hes done it 1-2/wk and he gets off the path too easily but its a GREAT step forward. I know his is gonna make it, I am going to drag him out of it, even if I have to handcuff and pull him out. He is now tryign to get his professional life back on track. But he is now clean. He got a big temptation/offer to smoke weed 2-3 weeks ago and he didnt. He was about to slip again but his wife held the line. We are all rooting for him to succeed.

comments,"TBH, I’d really consider perimeter college at GSU. Here’s my reasoning for that:

1) it’s SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than KSU or main campus GSU
2) it’s not as rigorous as GT but you get the same skills you need to succeed here
3) you still have the same chance of transferring in as you would from KSU or main campus GSU.  

Core math/science classes at GT are notoriously difficult, so if you get denied, take the opportunity to knock out those classes before
you get here via transfer and save yourself some money at the same time. 

Of course this is all assuming you don’t get in, and I think you have a pretty good shot at getting accepted.  I’m working on my 2nd bachelors degree and these are all things I wish someone would’ve told me before I started my first.",positive,0.982,positive,0.13402777777777777,11/18/2018

""Chance me"" posts are inherently flawed because none of us work in admissions. There's no way to give anyone any guarantee of being accepted/denied, the only thing we here on this sub can really do is 1: say ""you can do it! It doesn't hurt to try!"", or 2: give stats of people who were accepted/denied and compare them to the prospective students' stats (which, again, is flawed because stats aren't the only factor going into admissions). 

Both of those points get old, since every ""chance me"" post is basically asking the same thing.

comments,"If you're going into grad school, take linear algebra. And if you're going to grad school specifically for control/GNC, or maybe astrodynamics/orbital mechanics, I would strongly recommend a math minor; having a strong background in probability, linear algebra, and analysis will really open doors for you in theory-intensive courses.

If you're going into control/GNC/flight dynamics, but not necessarily to grad school, definitely take linear algebra. You'll want to kick ass in the system dynamics and control courses, and a strong background in linear algebra will help you do that.

If you're going into fluids / combustion, I would either do 4581 for the useful content or 4640 for the data processing intuition. Keep in mind that 4640 is mathematical in the spring and computational in the fall. From the engineering perspective, I'd take it in a fall semester, as it's taught by a CX professor and not a math professor.

If you're worried about your GPA, take 3670 and focus your efforts on your AE classes. 

If you're doing research, ask the grad students in your lab what to take.

I have been a PL for 2 years now and I love my job. because I get to help a whole bunch of freshman hopefully not make the same mistakes as me. That being said there has been plenty of nights where I was taking care of sick residents or dealing with drama instead of doing homework. You got to navigate that all carefully where you ask for personal space to do you as well as be there to support your residents.

Work wise, you have the two weeks training every summer that is complete BS, and then you have weekly staff meetings Mondays anywhere from 1-2.5 hours.

You have to be on duty anywhere between once a month, to once a week. as well. 

You also have to plan events (depending on staff, its anywhere between 2 a month to 1 a week). If you plan ahead and use events around campus (like sting break) as one of your events by dragging your residents to it, then it is no big deal.

 I would say 4-6 hours a week helping residents, 1-2 hours a week with paperwork or event planning. and then duty!

comments,"Tech has among the highest ratios in undergraduate engineering compared to other universities ([33.5%, compared to 17% nationally](https://coe.gatech.edu/rankings-and-stats)) ([38% overall](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/georgia-institute-of-technology-1569)).  It varies by major as well, with BME and IE being equally or slightly majority female and ECE and AE being smaller but with great camaraderie among female students.  We're also #1 in terms of engineering degrees awarded to women.

In today's world, a young woman studying engineering is no longer seen as an outsider.  Yes, we might be a minority if you look at the percentages alone, but 25% of \~2300 mechanical engineering students is still a solid group of 500+ women.  Basically, there's enough of us that we're not the only ones, nor are we treated as an oddity.  Unconscious biases could be found at any college, but it's not nearly enough to feel like something to constantly fight against.  Conversely, we also don't have to go out of our way call ourselves feminists.  We're simply accepted.  

My first real engineering experience was being the only girl on my high school FRC team, where I found it hard to speak up and be as involved as I wanted to. (The next year, we recruited more, and after that I switched teams) At Tech, it's much better, possibly because of maturity, changing attitudes about women in STEM, self-confidence, or something else.  If I've worried about anything related to gender, it's because of past experiences rather than things that have happened while I've been at Tech.  I honestly notice the ratio more often when I'm riding the bus or in line at the dining hall than I do in my mechanical engineering classes.  We have a large Society of Women Engineers (SWE), Women in Engineering (WIE), and some major-specific women's organizations, in addition to a strong group of social sororities.

There's a line in our fight song that students like to change the lyrics to.  Instead of ""Oh! If I had a daughter, sir, I'd dress her in White and Gold / And put her on the campus to cheer the brave and bold,"" we like to sing ""... And put her on campus to **raise the ratio!**""  The way all students - male, female, non-binary - enthusiastically cheer the last part is, I think, pretty telling about the general attitude.",positive,0.9945,positive,0.13276629072681703,11/18/2018

Cheap: Home Park - neighborhood north border of GT. You can usually get around 600-800/month in this area. However there's no guarantee that your room will be furnished. Also the safety is questionable on some streets.

Medium: GT on-campus housing - 10th Street Apartments go for 1000 per month with 4 month leases. Ok apartments, sorta close to the CS buildings. 

High: SQ5, The Standard, University House - All on East Campus near Tech Square. Great area for food/restaurants and proximity to Publix. Go for 1200-1500 per month with year-long leases depending on how many roommates you are willing to have. I've heard shitty things and good things about all three of these, so pick your poison.

comments,"Little late but here's my 2-cents

I was an RA for one year and HATED IT. When you're a PL, freshman will flock to you because they're new and want to be exposed to everything. You're interacting a ton with students and this is highly encouraged by RHA. When you're an RA, nobody wants to talk to you. They will see you as a snitch and already have an established group of friends, so they most likely don't want to show up to any activities you organize. I was an RA on west campus, and the general vibe was very quiet. I respected the fact that my residents did not want to interact with me outside of necessary contact. I was cool with that. RHA, on the other hand, was not. Those surveys you have to fill out every semester about your RA/PL? Yeah they take those super seriously. Most people on my floor said in those surveys that they wouldn't be comfortable talking to me about their problems, but were overall satisfied with the way I handled the floor. RHA didn't care and hammered into me that they want PLs and RAs that everyone feels comfortable sharing with. 

It takes a certain type of person to do this job. You have to be comfortable getting in people's business when they don't want it. Free housing is not worth being uncomfortable with invading privacy. I loved the other RAs in my building, and my Hall Director was a pretty great guy, but the job itself isn't worth it imo. You are expected to adhere to certain rules when interacting with residents outside of the building. If I was at a party and saw one of my underage residents there, it was highly encouraged to report them being there and not interact with them. 

TL;DR: You're a glorified babysitter and everyone doesn't want to be around you. You are expected to shove your presence down residents' throats and report them for everything. Free housing was not worth it ",positive,0.9901,positive,0.12040033796612745,11/19/2018

comments,"I took Physics 1 last summer online and it was so good. I took the in class version before and was not doing well at all and dropped it but the online version was so much better. It requires a bit more time than the in class version because each week you'll have to do a Skype-style recitation with 4 other students and have to finish a worksheet (2 hours on either M,T, or Wednesday), another Skype-style session with just your TA to answer a free response (free response given a week ahead and is a similar to the worksheet and took about 5-15 minutes on a thursday and Friday), then you had to do online homework and then you have to do one lab every two weeks (which took me \~3-4 hours to do because you have to do the experiment on a confusing software and make a video lab report).

&amp;#x200B;

The best part about this class were the tests because they were straight from old tests or recitation worksheets as supposed to the in class version where I felt like a lot of the questions were pulled from thin air. I got an A in the SOUP Physics 1 class whereas if I didn't drop the in class version, I would've probably ended up with a D.

&amp;#x200B;

But even if you suck at testing, it's really easy to do well on all the other aspects of the course (labs, recitation, free response answers, homework) and still do  well

comments,"YIKE!

For months, the BIRD and the LIME have been fighting it out until there is only one winner. Straight Outta Atlanta, who will rise to be the champion of the scooter gangs?

Well, unexpectedly, a THIRD gang arose out of nowhere. These were the PEDESTRIANS. These powerful nonsensical beasts would WAGER MONEY to ride on the backs of both the BIRDS and the LIMES solely for entertainment, oftentimes putting not only themselves but also the BIRD/LIME in danger! The BIRDs and LIMEs knew they must forget their differences and UNITE to take down the villainous pedestrian.  For once, the scooter gangs were no longer enemies but were a team working together to save the world as they knew it.

The pedestrians didn’t like this. They continued kidnapping BIRDs and LIMEs from their nests in the morning, much to their families’ despair. Sometimes these PEDESTRIANS traded off who was going to be the bully. By the end of the day, all the BIRDS’ and LIMEs’ batteries would be completely drained, rendering them powerless compared to the unstoppable PEDESTRIAN!

One day, a lonely pedestrian Timmy came across a dead BIRD lying on the ground.

“This poor BIRD, I can’t believe we as PEDESTRIANS have begun to do so much harm to another species.  cries What can I do to rescue this poor BIRD and other dying BIRDs around the world?” thought Timmy.

After much thought and experimentation, Timmy discovered one of the main features of the BIRDs: All you need is a small adapter and the BIRDs can be revived!

Timmy’s mind slowly began to change and morph into a variety of ideas, but ultimately one idea surfaced: he could abuse the BIRDs and LIMEs everyday but it would be okay because they could just be recharged and given a new life each night! That would not only give the BIRDs and LIMEs a new life, but it would also make them completely controlled by the PEDESTRIANS! If a scooter misbehaved, all a pedestrian would have to do is cut the charger that night to teach a lesson.

In a kinky way, the scooters liked this. They mistakenly realized PEDESTRIANS weren’t so bad after all. The BIRDs and LIMEs assumed that the pedestrians had their best interests in mind when really they were only using the scooters for personal gain.

The BIRDs and LIMEs got bored of this very quickly and began to fight once more. They found each other to be so equally matched, well, until BIRD GANG showed up, that is. BIRD GANG consists of the 12 HANGRIEST birds in existence. These guys absolutely DEVOURED the LIMEs.

BIRDs are Superior to LIMEs but PEDESTRIANS are superior to ALL.

A book, ""the how of happiness"", worked with my thinking style and helped me immensely, and I'm happy to report that for the last 8 years, depression has been the furthest thing from my mind. Never let go of hope! Incremental changes day by day can take you farther than you'd likely believe right now. If you want to pm me, I'd send you a copy of the book.

comments,"As someone who knows a fair amount about recreational drugs through  friends I can probably answer some of your questions. I personally haven't touched opioids and don't plan on it ever since downers in general aren't my thing, but I know a lot of people online who are users and you can clearly see a difference in their usage patterns, personality, and how they act. It seems that there's two different types of people who get into opioids at first.

First, you have people who have chronic pain, and they need some sort of opiate/opioid, benzo, or whatever to function in their daily life. These people generally have a longer term usage pattern and have fallen into a bad addiction once or twice, but they mostly have their lives under control and use some opioids daily to actually manage their illness. Usually they end up sticking to something cheaper and orderable greymarket or otc like Kratom or Casiprodol (Soma) and live an okay life. Some go down the path of mixing various downers and destroy their tolerances to hell and can't really function, but that's only some. I have a friend who's constantly downing pints of vodka and casiprodol just to deal with horrifying back pain and he can't ever hold a job due to it, but he gets disability (it's that bad), so it's not the end of the world for him.

On the other side of it, you see people who generally have hardcore escapist habits, are severely depressed, and feel they have nothing to live for getting into hard opioids because in their current situation they feel there's nothing better to do. These people are the ones you often hear about as the horror stories, but sometimes they're relatively ""normalish"" people. These people get into the habit a number of ways. Another friend of mine has a benzo script for his social anxiety, but really is now in love with all downers and loves blacking out/nodding off all day. He's a daily kratom user even though there's no real reason for him to need it. When he's not on downers of some sort, he's either on meth or dextroamphetamine (vyvanse) tweaking out all day. He loves his gabapentin, his ambien, his klonopin, his kratom, his tianeptine, and whatever else he can get his hands on. He stopped talking to me a while back, so I don't know how he's doing, but in all honesty he's probably fine. He's held down jobs before without too much of a problem, but he's been unemployed for a while because his parents came into money and don't care enough to stop him or kick him out.

&amp;#x200B;

Rereading this you probably want to hear more about HARD opioids like fentanyl/fentalogues and strung out heroin users, but I can't comment much on that. I have another friend online who has chronic pain and infrequently gets heroin to smoke as a semi recreational thing to do. He's fine in life right now. Also a student going through the motions of getting a degree. He has to take a semester off to recover from surgery for a super shitty back problem soon, but that's medical and not a drug issue. Overall the heroin users I've met aren't what you'd think of when you think of heroin users. The media definitely overplays drug use a metric fuckton. A saying that really holds true is that there are no bad drugs, only bad people. The only problem with fentanyl and related analogs is that they're often used as cutting agents, are mislabeled, or used like chemical weapons. If you get actual fentanyl/acetylfentanyl/carfentanil/etc, there are ways to use it correctly and not put yourself in danger. The reason the world sees drug use in such a bad light is mostly due to people using drugs being generally retarded, reckless, and severely mentally ill. Methamphetamine, Amphetamine, Ketamine, Morphine, Fentanyl, and other common horror story drugs are regularly used in medical settings still. PCP even used to be used medically and has medical use, but they just found things that better suited medical procedures.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I'm just rambling about dumb stuff, but I just want to make a public statement that you shouldn't do the typical vice documentary tier jeff sessions level ""drugs are bad mkay"" type of paper. Drugs are like guns. It's obvious we shouldn't give them to retards and mentally ill people, yet we blame drugs when we miseducate people about them and they easily get in the hands of the people who shouldn't have them. Much like the gun issue again, it's not black and white. Pure legalization isn't a great idea no matter how much r/Drugs thinks it's the best thing in the world. Regarding your paper, I just think you should take the approach that drugs are tools. People have had their lives changed for the better because of things like Kratom being around, yet it's labeled as an opiate and people want to rush to ban it. Then we have pharma companies putting shitloads of acetaminophen in pharmaceutical opiates so they're ""abuse proof"" making them even more dangerous.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck with your paper. I don't think you should hate on drugs. If you want to know more about people I know online who are opiate/opioid users I can definitely ask around and get more info about their lives. DM me :)",negative,-0.9988,neutral,0.025280028002800284,11/19/2018

comments,"That’s a fair point. Really I think the issue is more with a few subtle things in the wording which changing that one line doesn’t fix anyway.

First of all, notice that the daughter never actually ‘does’ anything. The lyrics are “I’d dress her in white and gold and put her on the campus to cheer for the brave and bold” not “She’d dress in white in gold and go to the campus to cheer for the brave and bold”. (I know it doesn’t have the same ring to it, I’m not a poet but you get the point.) By contrast the son actually does something - “he would yell to hell with georgia like his daddy used to do”. This is subtle but it implies that the son is capable of making his own decisions while the daughter apparently can’t even dress herself.

Additionally, it says “but if I had a son” rather than “and if I had a son” which is again subtle but implies a strong contrast between the daughter and the son.

These issues are definitely products of the time the lyrics were written. We’re not a linguistics focused school and I don’t foresee anyone thinking this is important enough to change (and upset a ton of wealthy alumni in the process), but I do personally like the small change to the “cheer for the brave and bold” lyric since at least to me it makes a statement that we are aware of the issues and understand that women have value greater than what dated fight song lyrics suggest.",positive,0.9768,positive,0.19646464646464645,11/19/2018

There were a lot of ECE majors in there, more than NRE majors potentially.

I don't know the professor teaching it now, but historically the grades are pretty good in that class and what you learn is fairly elementary. A caveat to that is that the class covers a lot of material. Its kinda like MSE 2001 where you have a large amount of info covered at a surface level.

&amp;#x200B;

 If you don't like NRE, the class will be a lot of memorization about stuff you don't care about.

Lastly, this course makes quite a few NRE students switch majors because they find out NRE isn't as interesting as they thought it would be.

comments,"**Privet**

A privet is a flowering plant in the genus Ligustrum. The genus contains about 50 species of erect, deciduous or evergreen shrubs, sometimes forming small or medium-sized trees, native to Europe, north Africa, Asia, many introduced and naturalised in Australasia, where only one species extends as a native into Queensland. Some species have become widely naturalized or invasive where introduced. Privet was originally the name for the European semi-evergreen shrub Ligustrum vulgare, and later also for the more reliably evergreen Ligustrum ovalifolium used extensively for privacy hedging, though now the name is applied to all members of the genus.

comments,"Im in the class right now with Steven Biegalski.

I can say for certain he's the best professor I have out of the 5 class Im taking. I make an effort to go to every one of his classes even if Im dying due to sickness. That's saying something considering I skip half my other classes on a normal day.

He at least makes an effort to make the topics interesting. That could be my personal bias as I am a NRE major (accepted in with it and not planning to switch unlike 80% of the other NRE majors that were accepted alongside me).

It's much less memorization than MSE2001. Out of the notes I've written, which is about 10 pages, you only need to know about half of it. Im taking MSE2001 right now and the amount of shit you need to memorize and regurgitate every test is insane. For example, you need to memorize the fact that austenite cools into a ferrite (iron rich) - cementite (carbon rich) two phase solid. The speed in which Austenite undergoes this transformation determines if it's martensite, bainite, or pearlite (slower cooling to the right, faster to the left). Martensite has needle like microstructure and is strong yet brittle, bainite has plate like microstructure with a balance of strength, pearlite has layers/lamellar microstructure which doesnt have much tensile strength but doesnt shatter. And you have to memorize that.

The tests for NRE2120 are real easy. Do the 6 homework problems that are due every other week and you'll be able to pass the class in a breeze. Along with up to 7 points of extra credit (each one +1% of your grade), if you dont pass the class with an A, you must really be trying. The test itself is just a trick of finding the right equation on the unlabeled equation sheet then plug and chug.

But yea, you wont be seeing any actual NRE majors in the class. The majority are there for electives.",positive,0.9144,positive,0.09630230880230879,11/20/2018

comments,"I’m an IE senior and getting an offer over $100k is very rare. Most range in the 60-70k range. Industries that go over are consulting, big oil, tech companies and banking. If you think consulting is your thing join consulting club. Big oil recruits a lot at GT(Exxon, Phillips 66, BP, Shell) and probably get up to the 85/90k range. Tech companies pay a lot (100k+)  but usually you have to move to super high cost of living areas and that ends up offsetting the pay differences. You need to be more of a coding guy too and less of an IE. Banking is really tricky to get into too, but Bank of America and Capital One are starting to recruit here more. I’ve heard of undergrads getting offers for 80k. And keep in mind since these places pay a lot they are VERY competitive. And once you get in you’re expected to work for you money, so long hours and crappy work is a possibility. 

For the data analytics/science, ISYE has started a data analytics concentration that you should look at. Otherwise go Quality and statistics if modeling/statistics is more of your thing. Both are useful, data analytics will get more attention though. Not sure what the stats are for grad school, but there’s lots of options popping up all over the country for programs in analytics. 

Hopefully along the way you will learn that it isn’t all about the paycheck. That’s a big component, but making yourself go do something you hate every day will drive you mad. ",negative,-0.5413,positive,0.08442028985507245,11/21/2018
comments,"Did IE undergrad and grad. You’re a freshman, so try to apply but don’t be bummed if you don’t get anything. You can take grad courses as an undergrad, and your options are (a) taking crosslisted grad courses, meaning undergrads take them with grad students or (b) take grad-only courses (recommended only if you are planning on applying to graduate school, might need permission).

For undergrad, they have a ton of different tracks but keep in mind that most only different by two or so courses. I haven’t done my research on this, but if your interest is quantitative finance, you will most likely have to get a graduate degree in order for companies to hire you.

As for salary, this depends wildly on where you work and what company you work for. A $100k position is so rare for ISYE (particularly undergrads) that I honestly would not even consider it a possibility. Also keep in mind that higher-paying jobs will likely require a significant amount of time and might throw your work-life balance out of whack. The higher end of consulting pays well, but you can be traveling 80%+ and working 8am-2am (and back the same day at 8am). 

So, TL;DR: don’t think about salary too much, and if you’re interested in quantitative trading, look at potential grad schools now. GT might not be the best place for that, but there’s a few other places where you can get a Master’s in it. Graduate school at ISYE (assuming you have no interest in PhD) should be done if you desire a cool data science or operations research position.",positive,0.9729,positive,0.1855072463768116,11/21/2018

If you know what you're doing, it's just new gym jitters. Where you aren't sure where all the machines and equipment are, or about the people quite yet. I get them all the time when I join a new gym. (Does anyone else?)  

If you don't know what you're doing, why don't you go with a friend? Not only because you'll have a buddy, but also you'll have the guidance who is familiar with the gym and weight training. It's very important to learn proper form and routine and not hurt yourself. I trained with guys who were gym rats when I first got into it. Helped me learn the basics. I had fun and they were super supportive  After a while, I just started going by myself...and then later I started training my other girl friends.

The gym is one of most non-judgmental places ever. People don't shoot down people trying to improve themselves. People only interrupt when you look like you need help or may hurt yourself.

Investment banking will probably but you in 6-figure range (80k base + 30-40k bonus) but you will be working close to 60-80 hours a week at least...more if you go to NYC(close to 100 hours).

At the end of the day, I think you should find what you are really passionate about whether it's IE-related or not at all and then pursue that. The money will eventually even out after a few years but at least you will be working at a job you enjoy if you find what you love!

comments,"As a mindset, forget everyone else. They’re thinking exactly the same way you are (it’s a little intimidating being around a lot of people and doing something that involves comparable levels). Make it solely your mission to workout. Everyone else doesn’t matter. If you have the mindset that you are somehow different and achieve different things by working out, you might become discouraged by the fact there are people that have spent a considerable amount of time just on working out. Once you become comfortable with that, warm up before working out. Do like 2-5 minutes on the bike, elliptical, or treadmill. After that, try to do  complex exercises (bench press, dumbbell bench press, leg press, squat, lunges, deadlift) to begin (try to do sets of 10-15 for like 4-5 sets, or less sets of you’re just starting). Try to do two complex exercises to start (called complex because they recruit the most muscle). Personally, I like to split my workouts into upper body vs lower body. So, after doing a complex exercise that applies to which section of the body you want to work, do auxiliary exercises that complement specific muscles. I.e. leg curls complement hamstrings and the glute machine thing by the elevator complements quadriceps. Bicep curls complement biceps and lat pull downs complement back. Don’t forget abdomen either. After every workout I do I usually do at least one abdominal exercise.

To outline a routine to begin

Warmup (little cardio to start heart rate up)
2 complex exercises (not done consecutively, do each on their own)
3 auxiliary exercises (done consecutively, as in each exercise is done after the other)
Abdominal exercise (sit-up, crunch, knee raises)

comments,"My thoughts:.  

Campus housing: close to everything but also by far the most expensive option for what you get.  Will be a lot easier if you never have lived on your own before.

Home park, and sometimes Centennial place: the rent is affordable and it's close to campus,  but the neighborhoods are slightly sketchy at night. Just use caution when walking around at night.  In many cases, the rooms often feel more cramped than campus housing (mainly as I can't loft my bed at my current place and we have a joke of a living room )

West Midtown/Midtown/Atlantic station: rents are a bit higher, but you get a nice place, but it's also a little bit of a walk into campus.  There are a few large student oriented housing towers (such as University House, Square on 5th) that largely compete directly with campus housing for features (often with individual bedroom leases), but also come close on price and location.

There's a Facebook group titled ""Find a place: sublease in ...

comments,"Cheap: Home Park - neighborhood north border of GT. You can usually get around 600-800/month in this area. However there's no guarantee that your room will be furnished. Also the safety is questionable on some streets.

Medium: GT on-campus housing, 100 Midtown - 10th Street Apartments go for 1000 per month with 4 month leases. Ok apartments, sorta close to the CS buildings. Idk about 100 Midtown but I heard it's cheaper than the High category.

High: SQ5, The Standard, University House - All on East Campus near Tech Square. Great area for food/restaurants and proximity to Publix.

And I've never heard an employer complain about this.

However, there is one specific case where you might be at a disadvantage YEARS later -- if your goal is obtaining a faculty position where you received your PhD.  Some have done it (as others here have noted), but it is a LOT more rare. There is a concern at the hiring stage about developing your own research program that is independent and sufficiently distinct from that of your PhD (or postdoc) advisor. Job applicants in this category have an a extra burden of proof that others do not.

(I'm in the category of BEE from GT, elsewhere for PhD and postdoc, then returned to GT as a professor)

Reconsider what high paying means to you.

There is a lot more to consider than just the the number.

One comparative example: My CS friends who went to SF. They earn six figures. I got offered 96k out of BME, which is technically lower. However, 96k in Georgia is probably going to take you farther than 150k in the SF bay area.

I also only work 40 hours a week (more like 35). I can flex my hours to skip a couple days every now and then if I want, without touching my PTO. This gives me time to run my own business, travel, and enjoy my hobbies. I have a fairly large four bedroom home with a giant yard, and two cars. I'm not living like Kanye, but I'm doing alright.

Most of my friends who are in SF live in apartments with 4 room mates, and spend 10+ hours a day in the office. To be fair, they enjoy what they do, and I am sure their stock options will actually be worth a fuck load in the future. Also, by their stories, SF is just a more fun and exciting place to life than ATL.

I also have several friends who went into consulting with Bain, McKinsey, and Deloitte. Their lifestyle is pretty much nonstop luxury travel and hotels. However, they always work crazy hours...like worse than the hours of my CS buddies in SF. The essentially live as consultants. But the lifestyle is worth it to them.

So TL;DR: Figure out what lifestyle you want. Find the job that will let you do that. Then find the major that will get you that job.",positive,0.9915,positive,0.1908726551226551,11/22/2018

1) A matrix (as a function) is one to one if and only if there is a pivot in every column.  

2) A matrix (as a function) is onto if and only if there is a pivot in every row. 

then you can sort of derive most of the statements from the invertible matrix theorem. I used to T.A for 1553 and I always thought the best way to consistently get T/F questions right is to write out proofs (or counter examples) for each question. Writing proofs takes a while, but I think that it helps me when I'm studying for math tests (I get a lot of intuition in the process).

comments,"It looks like Rabinoff's book doesn't actually have any exercises, just examples with the solutions written directly below. 

I'm not sure what exactly you mean when you say you do all of them, but if you are just reading the solution that is definitely not sufficient to get a good understanding. You should read the ""exercise"" and complete it on your own without looking at anything (if you can't do this, go back and look at the material, don't look at the solution until you come up with an answer). If you have not been doing this, then it will take much much longer...but it is certainly necessary if you are struggling.

Also, don't start with the practice exams. Study as much as you think you need to (by doing book/worksheet exercises), then when you feel ready, do a practice exam without looking at any notes. Also time yourself. This will tell you whether you are really as ready as you feel. 

I hope this helps - if you have already been doing these things...then honestly I would try looking for exercises in other textbooks. They will probably have much more difficult exercises than the examples in Rabinoff's book. ",positive,0.9817,positive,0.12960526315789472,11/23/2018

comments,"When a company can hire varies greatly.  If a company has a pressing or immediate need, then it is only their internal bureaucracy and red tape that slows them down.   Some companies target their new hires to start around the beginning of their fiscal year (which may or may not coincide with the start of the calendar year).   

&amp;#x200B;

The very end of the year (between mid October and December) is usually pretty tricky to get on because is atypical for a fresh-from-college-hire to be essential... so the holidays and the end-of year rush to complete projects will often take priority meaning that hiring managers dedicate less time to reviewing resumes and scheduling phone screens and interviews.   

&amp;#x200B;

Rents can be lower in the winter, but often time so is available the inventory (especially if you're looking to rent privately).   

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I would schedule your graduation for the earlier date and then start applying like crazy to jobs when you're 6-months out.    If you find a job in that time then you're all set!  If not, then you can re-adjust your schedule (presumably the non-essential classes) and take a very light schedule the remaining semester while you scramble to find a job (even one that might not be directly career-related).

It's also useful to be very comfortable with the basic proof techniques : proof by contradiction, direct proof, and induction. In introduction math classes these techniques make up like 90% of all proofs.

To study for number theory ahead of time, I'd suggest getting the textbook, doing as many exercises as possible, and then getting someone to check some of your proofs. Hope this helps!",positive,0.9694,positive,0.312,11/24/2018

It all comes down to your circumstances, but I was living in a cheap apartment by I-285 in an area that did not speak predominantly English. I knew no one my age and there was zero community for me- it was difficult to even find another college-aged student anywhere. Not to mention how detached I felt from campus life...

To say it was lonely is a bit of an understatement. I was pretty depressed. With no one really to talk to or hang out with, I spent a lot of the holidays last year just trying to distract myself from how quiet and empty the apartment was. I constantly felt uncomfortable with the place I lived in and ended up feeling like I didn't really belong anywhere.

I have a roommate now, and although we don't talk that much, just knowing there's someone else here does a lot for me mentally. Yeah, it sucks when he doesn't clean the fridge or the sink is dirty for a few weeks but I'd take that over sitting in a cold, empty apartment and feeling like I had no one to go to when school was getting the best of me.

comments,"I will pass along your comments to GT Dining administrators. They have been exceptional about letting SGA know about the pipe bursting, and from what I can tell are doing everything possible to work with Facilities Management to get it fixed as quickly as possible. The last I heard, they are hoping to have NAVE Dining reopened tomorrow night, but they cannot say anything with 100% certainty as the Health Department is having to come by and give their approval, since the pipe that burst contained sewage water from the above dorm bathrooms. 

I will talk with administrators and make sure everything is cleared up on the website. There should also be a sign posted on the door of the Dining Hall with the adjusted hours for Brittain posted as an alternative option. Since you didn't see one, I'll head to NAVE Dining in a few minutes and see if it's been taken down accidentally. If so, I'll ask if they can get a new one put up. 

It also looks like the What's Open Now page has been updated. Sorry about the website not being up-to-date before. To be a bit of a devil's advocate, the woman we've been working with in GT Dining has been AMAZING, and it's likely that they were so preoccupied trying to get the pipe fixed that forgetting the website was a simple oversight. Next time something like this happens, we'll be sure to ask them to update the website ASAP to keep y'all informed! Thank you for the feedback, we really appreciate it!

Note: According to this page, it does look as though NAVE should be open tomorrow at 4PM:

comments,"I’ve never actually lived without a roommate, but ever since leaving freshman dorms, I’ve essentially lived with roommates in the “we share a common space, but nothing else” kind of way. It basically feels like living alone outside of when I run into roommates in the kitchen/living room, especially since my roommates have mostly stayed in their rooms with the doors shut.

Personally, I love that arrangement, and I actually think I’d like it even more if I lived alone. Like when my current roommate goes out of town, I really enjoy that time (as much as I love my roommate) because I feel like I can do whatever I want without disturbing anyone. 

But I’m also very much an introvert who’s comfortable spending lots of time alone. If you’re not too comfortable by yourself for long periods of time, I wouldn’t recommend living alone unless you find a group of friends and frequently hang out with them — and if your place is large enough, you can host a lot of stuff because you won’t have to worry about bothering your roommate(s). 

I also would recommend living close to campus if you live by yourself. It’s a lot lonelier if you have to drive to campus just to hang out with friends. ",positive,0.9925,positive,0.16639315230224322,11/25/2018

\- You have more control over everything, including kitchen. 

\- It will force you to be outgoing. I frequently met up with people and can confidently say my social life improved because I had to be out there. Fun wasn't going to come to me; I had to go get it.

\- You can 100% be yourself. It really forces you to be independent. Groceries, cleaning, it's all on you... Just like how it works outside of college. 

&amp;#x200B;

Living alone is slightly more expensive, but if you can afford it, I say you should absolutely do it. It's forced me to grow a ton. For reference, I know friends that lived in North Ave for most of their undergrad and lived alone after college. They found it difficult to manage being alone.

comments,"1. As with most colleges, the classes become more meaningful and fair the higher up you go. You'll start with the all of the weed-out courses taught by professors who would much rather be doing research, but eventually you get to the point where the professors really love what they teach and it shows. GT is definitely a lot of work but if you make it in you definitely have what it takes to succeed. 

2. There are many sophomores who live in apartments on campus, and many others who have apartments off of campus. The costs differ dramatically between as low as $300/month to as high as over $1000/month. I'd definitely suggest doing your own research, but your three main choices for living are on-campus apartments (prices  listed on the GT housing site), apartments in midtown (there are a lot, and many specifically cater to students), or houses in home park. They each have their benefits and drawbacks, and I think there is another older post in this subreddit that goes into more detail. 

3. This strongly varies on the person. Personally, I'm in the marching band, so I'm very involved in school traditions and athletics. I also  used to be involved with a few academic competition teams like RoboJackets. There are many people that are far more social than I am, and there are many students that are far less social than I am. There are definitely plenty of ways to get involved in many different organizations at Tech. 

4a. Regarding your residency status, I recommend you look into that a little closer. Last I checked, claiming residency to get in-state tuition is much harder than you made it seem. I'm also OOS, and if it was that easy to transfer residency and pay in-state tuition, I would have already done so. 

4b. The weather here is very different. It's made a huge (positive) difference for me but make sure you're okay with very warm and hot temperatures for most of the year. 

4c. From what I've seen, there are few places in the US where people care so much about what they are studying. We have some of the most amazing and creative minds I've ever seen and they're doing extraordinary things. Just talking with people about their work is amazing, and it makes me feel really lucky to be able to go to this school. Yes, this school has it's problems, but the engineer mindset of this school and it's students are the reason why it's still so great.

2. This seems to have been a pretty effective way of notifying SGA, they've been very active on reddit, and their response is above.
3. I've conveyed indirectly the changes I'd like to see take place: a bus tracking system that works for buses I see running on weekends (like the Trolley), and accurate communication about which dining services will be open at what times. I thought I could trust [https://gatechdining.com/dining-near-me/open-now](https://gatechdining.com/dining-near-me/open-now), but this site and a couple of other resources were wrong, leading to likely around 20-30 students total venturing on foot to a closed dining hall, surely none of whom were happy about this either.
4. They apparently fixed the site after my post and put up a paper sign saying that Brittain was open in North Ave's place, but this must've been a while after I left.

Seriously. If it was fun and you have time to continue, you should do it.

Leadership is a little different, because you **HAVE** to be involved with the club. If you're having a busy semester, you can't just ""drop"" the club. You can always ask the other officers to help out during hell weeks and stuff, but you still have to plan events/meetings. Of course, the amount of time required by leadership changes depending on what club you're in.

Right after I changed my major I didn't feel any better.  In fact, I was legal to buy alcohol that semester so I went into a small spiral, DON'T DO THAT.  It got better over the months since I was able to join them when I normally wouldn't because of school work.  I did feel better then.  I was able to join in on the grilling more, the caveman in me loves to putting meats over a fire.

Now for the second answer.  It should be noted I'm an introvert and I'm no social butterfly.  I don't have a lot of friends but the ones I do are worth my time.  I do feel good afterward yes and no.  Sometimes it can be draining when I'm in social settings that I'm uncomfortable to be in but the overall I would say yes.  Most of my friends, keep in mind I don't have a lot, are close and a good bit are like family and vice-versa I to them.  We stay in touch and see each other every now and then.

comments,"It's the idea that if you attend the same graduate program that you attended for undergrad, you won't be introduced to new and different views on topics and instead you'll just have the same beliefs reinforced, which is considered bad for the student. On the reverse side, it's also seen as bad for the department as the graduate student is going to be one of the primary drivers for innovation in research, but if you went to the same school for undergrad then  you won't be bringing anything new to the table either. 

As to whether or not it's actually a problem is debatable. I think it depends on the individual and the program. If your undergrad department is very large, then it's entirely possible that your graduate research will not overlap at all with your undergraduate experiences. Also, if your department is very highly ranked, then others will understand why you stayed. I went to GT for undergrad and stayed for grad school, but my department is split between GT and Emory, so I intentionally chose an Emory lab which let me stay in the same department while still getting that diversity. Additionally, it's consistently ranked top 3 in the world and the research here was what I wanted to do, so it made sense to stay. For the individual, I think it's only really a potential problem if you're planning to pursue a career in academia. 

Of course, that's my opinion. Others see it differently. Some may not care at all while others may think it's a very big deal. ",positive,0.853,neutral,0.02314994096812281,11/26/2018

This is on point. Looking at how marginalized and minority groups are treated is one way of evaluating the liberal or conservative attitudes of a body. Scout's killing last year was followed with more unity for GTPD than it did Scout or any marginalized communities.

There's a lot of apathy regarding anything not related to school work here. Coupling that with the views I've seen towards fellow minority members, I'd say GT leans more conservative.

Many people think the student body leans liberal, but based on the actions of students (or lack there of), it leans conservative.",negative,-0.765,positive,0.21428571428571427,11/26/2018

I assure you, the concepts you missed on old exams will be on the final. It might not be the same questions verbatim, but it'll be there.

Good tip- **go through old exams and write notes for each question you missed**. If it's something that's easy to ""trick"" you with (you know the type), make sure you note common tricks so you won't make that mistake. And again, if you STILL don't get it, go talk to your prof/TA. One-on-one time is very different then taking notes in lecture. This is true for all classes.

To answer your other question- **it's ENTIRELY possible to flip your grade around**. I went from like a 60 something to an 89 (so close to an A) in chem 1212 based solely on the final.

comments,"I'm assuming you're asking about what changes SGA is working on. Right now, we're in the middle of an RFP process exploring the possibility of switching vendors from Sodexo to someone else, so that's been the main thing we've been focusing on. On top of that, we have several projects we are working on. A few of them are still very much in the works, and GT Dining does not wish for us to communicate them right now since they're very up in the air. Some of the ones we can share:

\-Adding reusable containers to the dining halls. The hope is that this would help cut down waste and allow people to take full meals out of NAVE and Brittain instead of waiting around

\-Improving food variety, particularly with regard to increasing options for vegetarian, vegan, halal, and kosher diets. We were able to work with dining to get a halal station added at NAVE this semester, and are hoping to get that dramatically expanded

\-Ensuring that food and utensils are available at the dining halls all day. We are well aware of the issues that have been occurring with regard to running out of food and utensils/plates/bowls, and are working with GT Dining to decrease and hopefully eliminate this in the future

\-Improving food quality. We know this has been a major point of concern and are trying to pinpoint areas where we can identify the cause of these issues and attempt to combat them

\-Labeling. As of a couple weeks ago, there is an app called ""Bite"" that students can go onto to view nutritional information about food in all the dining halls. As we continue with this, we're hoping to add QR codes in the dining halls that students with dietary concerns can scan to pull up menus and easily find food that works for their needs. It's not perfect yet, but it's a start!

\-Emergency situations. Last year, we had major issues with wait times after it snowed. We are working with dining to find ways to prevent this from happening in the future so students are able to get food during a snowstorm instead of going hungry due to insane wait times

\-More places to use meal swipes. We were able to get Starbucks added on, and hot chocolate/tea added once we heard feedback about those not being included with a meal swipe. Moving forward, we are hoping to expand the number of places students can use their meal swipes and dining dollars even more.

While these don't cover quite everything the Campus Enterprises Committee specifically is doing, hopefully that helps give you a good idea. Many of the things we're working on come from the results of a survey we currently have out to garner student opinion and feedback regarding dining on campus. If there are any areas of concern you would like to see addressed but is not on this list, please let us know so we can get it addressed!",positive,0.9826,positive,0.14664186507936508,11/26/2018

comments,"Most freshmen do the Freshmen Experience, where you live in a traditional dorm (2 or sometimes 4 share a room; single-gendered floors have a community bathroom, kitchen, and lounge) or suites (single or double bedrooms, shared bathroom between 2 bedrooms, community kitchen and lounge). There are more traditional rooms than suites and are generally newer than suites (with a few exceptions). Dorms are on either East Campus (along Techwood Drive) or West Campus (around West Village). Suites (Woodruff) are only on West. 

I think freshmen get to choose their room nowadays (we used to be assigned by Housing, but not anymore). If you know who you want to room with, there’s a thing on the housing portal to add them as a roommate. If not, then you can choose any room that’s available. Facebook groups tend to pop up to help incoming students find roommates, or you can go into it blind. 

While it’s not required to live on-campus, it’s a really good way to meet people and get accustomed to Tech. PL’s (freshmen RA’s) do a lot to be helpful and involved for their residents. I’d highly recommend it for freshmen year. 

After that, undergraduate students can live in apartment-style housing, with rooms for 2, 4, or 6 students (most are 4). Each person gets a bedroom, two share a bathroom, and everyone in the room shares a kitchen and living area. Again, they’re on either East or West Campus, and students self-assign to whichever room. The Graduate Living Center also has rooms, which are near the biotech quad but that’s it. Suite style and traditional dorms are also availble in Woodruff and Fulmer, respectively. If you go Greek, rooms in your chapter’s house could be available.  Additionally, you can live off campus, which can be cheaper (Home Park) or give more bang for your buck (SQ5, others in Midtown). If you’re studying Business, apartments in Tech Square are closer to Scheller, which is more convenient. Otherwise, it comes down to personal preference. 

If you want to know about specific dorms, search around this sub. ",positive,0.9738,positive,0.13201622132656615,11/26/2018

comments,"So part of the problem definitely is that it's not an area where we have a ton of power, though we do get to speak with administrators a fair amount and are doing our best to try to get these issues addressed. 

We are also running into issues with the RFP. While we have been working with GT Dining this semester in order to try to get prices lowered and quality increased for next year, the people that will control this directly are more so going to be the vendors we work with combined with GT Dining. If we were to switch vendors, then we'll have to completely restart those conversations with someone else. Our plan right now is to wait for the results of the RFP to be released and then immediately begin working with those people who control prices, quality, etc in our next vendor, or continue working with the current person if we stick with Sodexo. 

While it may be hard to get both changed simultaneously- that is, prices lowered and quality improved or vice versa, our goal is to get at least one of those addressed and substantially improved by next year. I'll be posting an update once I'm able to regarding the RFP, but until that's decided we're in a bit of a tough spot when it comes to making huge, long-term changes. On the bright side, that will likely be released by next week so once it does we can really get the ball rolling.

Despite that, we have been working pretty closely with Sodexo in order to get specific things changed in the dining halls. There were some staffing changes that occurred at North Avenue several weeks ago, and since that happened we've heard some great feedback about how the food quality and employee performance has improved. We still have a long way to go, but it's an improvement at least. We've gotten the Student Center checked and sprayed for pests, specifically bugs, as that has been a multi-time concern with the SC salad bar. We have also had a pest control unit sent to WV due to reports of rats outside. In the Student Center, we're working with Sodexo to come up with $5 favorite options that will give people a bit of a cheaper alternative. These are all pretty small scale, but at the very least it's shown that we do have at least SOME sway and there is definitely the potential to turn these smaller-scale projects into large-scale changes/improvements.

Again, I'm hoping that I can give you a more comprehensive response once we know what company we'll be working with moving forward, but until that happens all we have to work with is GT Dining and speculation. If you have any suggestions for ways you think food quality or prices could be improved, please let us know! We take all the feedback we get very seriously, and we've been able to make substantial progress with a lot of our initiatives this semester. If you aren't keen on posting here or would rather talk face-to-face, I'm happy to give you my email via PM and we can set up a meeting or chat through there. We will also be having a meeting/lunch with GT Dining administrators on December 3- if you would be interested, let me know and I will get you a spot. That would be a good option if you feel pretty strongly about the subject and would like to give your firsthand opinion to the people who have a direct say in some of these decisions.",positive,0.9983,positive,0.14358493752110776,11/26/2018

If you don’t have a pan and a wooden spoon/spatula you can get them at publix for less than $50, and will last a long time if you take care of them. The only way gt dining makes sense economically is if the alternative is eating at a restaurant every day, and even then you’d have better food.

There are two publix grocery stores in walking distance, one in atlantic station and the other across from u-house. On weekends there is a bus shuttle to the atlantic station one, and for the whole week buses go to marta, which is near the other one. They used to go directly to it, but stopped bc rha is jealous of uhouse or something like that. Since you’re a bit on the far side of campus you may want to use the buses. I personally don’t bc the schedule is a bit unreliable, I don’t like taking the bus and I don’t mind walking, but I understand why some people would want to.

comments,"After almost an entire semester of this, I’m going to complain. I have the most annoying girl in my math class. Like, I hate everything that comes out of her mouth. First off, she has the most annoying nasally voice. It is like nails on a chalkboard plus the sound your cat makes when you accidentally step on them. Her voice somehow walks a fine line between never asking questions, ending every sentence as a question, and having infinite inflection everywhere, despite only maintaining one tone that sounds farted out of your fifth grade recorder.

That is the voice I hear CONSTANTLY throughout my lectures. She sits right behind me, despite my asking her on multiple occasions to please be considerate of the fact that I have ADHD, to begging her to please allow me to hear the professor, that perhaps if she wants to talk she should sit somewhere else, all the way to kindly asking her to please shut up, she still proudly maintains her seat directly behind me.

(No I can’t move, this is my unassigned assigned seat, and I’d like to maintain being able to see the board. Also, moving means someone else will have to sit here in my place, and I refuse to condemn anyone to such a fate.)

The numeric rating for ""how effective was the instructor"" is passed along and is important to the school, but professors have been defensive about allowing their CIOS comments to be readily passed upwards. Just a heads up - if there's a big issue that you feel administration should know about, CIOS may be not be sufficient means to communicates it.

Any faculty here, please correct me if I'm wrong.

comments,"After almost an entire semester of this, I’m going to complain. I have the most annoying girl in my math class. Like, I hate everything that comes out of her mouth. First off, she has the most annoying nasally voice. It is like nails on a chalkboard plus the sound your cat makes when you accidentally step on them. Her voice somehow walks a fine line between never asking questions, ending every sentence as a question, and having infinite inflection everywhere, despite only maintaining one tone that sounds farted out of your fifth grade recorder.

That is the voice I hear CONSTANTLY throughout my lectures. She sits right behind me, despite my asking her on multiple occasions to please be considerate of the fact that I have ADHD, to begging her to please allow me to hear the professor, that perhaps if she wants to talk she should sit somewhere else, all the way to kindly asking her to please shut up, she still proudly maintains her seat directly behind me.

(No I can’t move, this is my unassigned assigned seat, and I’d like to maintain being able to see the board. Also, moving means someone else will have to sit here in my place, and I refuse to condemn anyone to such a fate.)

From proclaiming her co-op interview as, “lit,” but “lame,” claiming KSU students don’t deserve to complain because they aren’t, “grinding” like her, to today, talking about how she had to, “flex” on her mom over thanksgiving break, I am a broken woman. Even now, she sits behind me, surely about to break into some duologue with her evil compatriot sitting beside her, whose only saving grace is actually knowing how to fucking whisper.

Her voice somehow walks a fine line between never asking questions, ending every sentence as a question, and having infinite inflection everywhere, despite only maintaining one tone that sounds farted out of your fifth grade recorder.

That is the voice I hear CONSTANTLY throughout my lectures. She sits right behind me, despite my asking her on multiple occasions to please be considerate of the fact that I have ADHD, to begging her to please allow me to hear the professor, that perhaps if she wants to talk she should sit somewhere else, all the way to kindly asking her to please shut up, she still proudly maintains her seat directly behind me.

(No I can’t move, this is my unassigned assigned seat, and I’d like to maintain being able to see the board. Also, moving means someone else will have to sit here in my place, and I refuse to condemn anyone to such a fate.)

From proclaiming her co-op interview as, “lit,” but “lame,” claiming KSU students don’t deserve to complain because they aren’t, “grinding” like her, to today, talking about how she had to, “flex” on her mom over thanksgiving break, I am a broken woman. Even now, she sits behind me, surely about to break into some duologue with her evil compatriot sitting beside her, whose only saving grace is actually knowing how to fucking whisper. Thus, I am writing this diatribe instead of paying attention in class, in hopes of sharing my story, in hopes one day, someone can solve the problem of people who just need to shut the fuck up.

Stipulating to the figure you gave for GT, it's 45 per 100,000. While we do have a national statistic for suicide rate, we have none for GT specifically.

Even if everyone deals with stress differently, things like having more counselors/therapists availble, improving housing and dining facilities, limiting the culture of overworking until you’re beyond burned out, etc. can positively affect the whole community. 

It seems like campus uses events (Health Initiatives stuff, The Final Stand, etc.) and therapy dog visits to help students deal with stress rather than address the sources of that stress. Some of us face pressure throughout the entire semester, and a handful of events here at the end doesn’t fully make up for it.

So to what you're saying specifically, I think that there will always be people out there who are more well-equipped to deal with the extreme stress present here.

Fact of the matter is a lot of sports and their athletes get free rides off the poor students backs. When no one cares for their sports. I believe if a sport can’t support itself it should be cut. Students shouldn’t have to pay to support sports that aren’t wanted by most. (If they were wanted by most they could support themselves) The current system is a monopoly.

There are trillions of examples of this, but one seldom-mentioned is what they do when a person faces passive suicidal ideation (meaning they want to die, but aren't actively planning on killing themselves).

Georgia Tech sends students facing that issue to an institution called Ridgeview. It's a for-profit psycho-ward, riddled with issues such related to greed, unqualified staff (like GT counseling), and practices with cause undue trauma to patients sent there. Students who have been sent there have voiced their concerns and trauma to GT administration and GT counseling, but their practices have not changed.

This is all in the wake of the tragic death of another student, following years of mental health care which just isn't good enough for students, or in many cases, *makes their situation worse.*

Some vaccines (rotavirus, mumps, measles, rubella vaccine, and the old polio vaccine) contain live viruses.  When the vaccines are administered, the live viruses can be shed from the recipient through feces, especially, although perhaps through other secretions as well.  

Although I think documentation of MMR shedding is rare and mostly in theory, we KNOW rotavirus is transmitted this way from vaxxed infants.  The old, live polio vaccine caused quite a bit of trouble for us in the US with transmitted polio; in countries where oral polio vaccine (using live virus)  is still used, it continues to cause polio problems in others around the recipient.

I tried to make an appointment recently and was told that they are completely booked for the next 3.5 weeks. 3.5 weeks is nearly a month. So if I'm going through an issue, the counseling center essentially says go fuck off for a month and then come back.

So naturally I made the appointment but ended up cancelling 2 weeks later since the source of my issues (at the time) had passed and I ended up dealing with it myself. But what if some other person can't deal with it themselves? Chances are they end up like that person in skiles.

Now, the counseling center does offer immediate assistance if you are truly about to commit suicide, but why on earth would anyone ever go on record to say they are planning on killing themselves? The police will just lock you in a mental ward for 3 days while surveying you and bill you thousands of dollars for the privilege of the experience. All those missed classes/work/homework plus the bill will only make the entire situation significantly worse.

As far as it goes once you have an interview, I think I have about a 50% success rate for any given interview. That is, there is a 50% chance I move on to the next round or get the job if it is the final interview. But again that definitely depends on the person. Know your own abilities, and if you are not always great in interviews make sure you get a lot.

You won't get locked up for saying you're feeling suicidal.  If you threaten to harm yourself or others, you will be put in jail or in a hospital so you can be watched.  Been there, done that.  Not fun, and cost my parents $30,000.

comments,"Yeah idk that I believe this...I have friends who I know went to Stamps and are now dead because of suicide.  I went to the counseling center when I was suicidal and was told they couldn't help me because there was a 2 month waiting list - and when I was interning, they were unwilling to even give me referrals.  Thankfully my parents' insurance allowed me to go to a private therapist, but not everyone has that luxury.

I have personally known and been close to 6 different Tech students who committed suicide.  So, I don't buy the idea that we have a lower than average rate until I see the numbers.

I have watched someone die by suicide every year, and every time people say not to politicize their death.  I think this is analogous to the gun control debate - if we cannot discuss mental health resources now, then when?

comments,"Mental health crises are not solved in such a simple way, and I readily recognize that, but I want to express that I value you. You, the person reading this, who is likely a Georgia Tech student. I was one of those once, and I'm still around working nearby. Just today I spent hours bringing a new student on board for the project I manage. I see y'all; I see you.

And no, it does not seem like GT is moving fast enough to help students in the acute and significant ways that mental health issues require. I'm not going to pretend to understand how it feels to be under the peak levels of stress some classes create combined with the depths of depression. I can offer as much sympathy and empathy as I can muster, promising you that I have you deep in my thoughts, holding on to that awful, traumatic experience as best I can, even for a few seconds. Maybe that lightens the load, lets you see outside the despair. Maybe it doesn't.

I wonder if community action could be an alternative here. What if folks gathered together who wanted and needed to talk about their issues in a known and dedicated space? Formed pairings and partnerships of support? I don't have the direct knowledge of what's available right now, but I want to paint a picture of what student action could do. Obviously this would require attention and care and significant responsibility, and it wouldn't take the place of more direct healthcare.

But I believe that if this is a need the GT community has, it can rise to this challenge. If this would be useful to you, or if it already exists in some form that more people should know about, say so. Or I guess just upvote.

comments,"Speak with a Dean from the Dean of students (Or even the womens center - I've always found Colleen Riggle very helpful). You have options left to you as far as academics. You can incomplete, assuming you're passing the course currently (D or better, though I've gotten incompletes when that wasn't true also). This means you have until the end of the next semester in residence (so spring) to complete the coursework. Once you do, you submit a form to the registrar so they change your grade from an I to whatever you got. If you have spring courses that are depending on current courses as pre-requisites, I don't think you can take those if you incomplete the pre-req. 

You could try to submit everything and take your finals and if it doesn't go well, you can petition the undergraduate committee for retroactive withdrawal - you write a petition, include letters from docs and faculty, documentation of the situation. 

You can also incomplete some, and finish some on time. You could incomplete some, take the others, and still retroactively withdraw. But you'll want a dean on your side if it comes to you submitting a petition to withdraw, so get one involved now.

When I get overwhelmed drawing out the time I have and making a plan for when I will do each assignment reduces stress levels a lot for me. Block out time to work and time to take breaks.

And if you’re like me and find it impossible to sit in class and take notes, try to just go to class and passively pay attention at least. I find doing something mindless in class like doodling or playing with a fidget spinner works better than trying to actively pay attention and take notes because when I try the latter I end up looking at my phone or laptop and missing the lecture entirely.

comments,"Disclaimer: Hey! I'm the aforementioned girlfriend!So, basically what the emergency medical withdrawal does is it protects any student undergoing extreme circumstances (i.e. mental  or physical health problems, etc.) to protect themselves and they're academic standing/GPA from being tarnished. The semester I withdrew, I was suffering pretty heavily from anxiety and depression and had been using my school's on-campus counseling services to help with some of the stress. I kept putting off the idea that my failing grades and decreasing mental stability were anything else but my own fault, but I was wrong. That semester, I met with one of the school psychiatrists and finally accepted a diagnosis and prescription. My counselor was the one who told me about the option for medical withdrawal; it has to be done within 2 semesters of the semester being requested (according to my university's bylaws) and you must include an essay explaining your extreme circumstances and any documents supporting your explanation to give it merit. I was lucky enough that I was diagnosed by school employment, so my counselor and psychiatrist both gave hard copies of my medical record, progress, and personal surveys (with my signed consent) to the Dean of Admissions for consideration. It was intense but it was honestly the best thing I could've done for myself, and not a day has gone by where I've regretted my decision. If all goes well, your request will be granted and your current semester will be erased from your transcript, like you never took it at all. There should be more information provided about medical withdrawal on Tech's student base website. I hope this helped- and maybe take it easy next semester. I only enrolled in lib arts classes that next semester after and it helped my GPA go up and got me to declare a psychology minor!",positive,0.9841,positive,0.058203124999999994,11/27/2018

You don't mention it (and don't need to, it's private) but stopping/starting SSRIs and ADHD meds can be sometimes non-trivial.  If you haven't been getting quality medical oversight while in school it might be time to seek it out; hell, if nothing else there are anxiety meds available that might work.

I took a medical withdrawal from another university as a freshman for similar reasons.  It sucked and was very humbling, but it's survivable.  If this is the path you wind up choosing your parents might be a little annoyed, but they will understand and they still love you.

comments,"I don't know how many fellow students have compromised immune systems or relevant medical conditions that would make getting the flu especially bad, but I know they'd want able-bodied people to get their flu shots. While I'm not on campus  and am transferring for personal reasons, I have family and friends that can never get certain immunizations again for medical reasons. If I was going to be on campus, and even knowing I won't be, I feel safer and I would feel less concern for people like my dad if as many able-bodied people had  immunizations as possible. Have you presented the ingredients in current flu shots (they use better ingredients now than they used to) and shown them evidence that none of them are poisonous, at least or especially at such small doses? If it's not poison, and the worst that could happen is that he might get sick/he thinks he'll get sick from it, that could happen anyway regardless of the vaccine, so it shouldn't matter? Has he talked to any medical professional about this? Also flu can definitely be lethal, so that's one more reason that line of thinking is bull. If this might help, I listened to this a few weeks back, and the woman speaking here is a doctor. https://overcast.fm/+9U1cPA I just realized that's an app-centric link, but it's Sawbones episode ""27 Reasons Why You Should Get A Flu Shot"". Oh and I'm not positive without checking sources but I'm pretty confident that flu season is not over. It might have peaked already, but historically bad outbreaks happen at the start of a year as well, often in February.  All in all, I know we can't force someone to get a flu shot, but I mostly don't want this person trying to convince others of their beliefs, because we need every person possible for herd immunity. That, and stuff like this contributes to why we're seeing outbreaks of things we hadn't seen in a while. Yes, people can get sick even though they got a flu shot, but the shot doesn't CAUSE the illness--it only provides some protection from some, the predicted-to-be-most-prominent, strains.

comments,"I don't know if this would make a difference to anyone or not, but I and a ton of people I know get so frustrated and even anxious hearing about anti-vaxers that it can be hard to keep composure. Tons of educated, learned people, people with relevant credentials, recommend vaccinations. So seeing people echo sentiments that we have strong evidence against can be very upsetting, especially as a scientist. When I see it, it's enough to make me visibly angry. I don't know how many people feel the same, but that's part of why I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this here, because some conversations are more difficult in person where the immediacy of emotional response can make things heated. Maybe people can upvote this post or a comment if they really don't like seeing, strongly disagree with, and/or get viscerally angry or anxious when they see pro-antivaxxer arguments? Maybe, though I'm cautiously not getting my hopes up, maybe if they see just how many of their fellow students feel strongly about the issue, they'll at least reconsider their stance? 

I get wanting to roast people, but that often doesn't help people be more receptive to an opposing side's views, it'll just get them angry and defensive and make the issue at hand less about the importance of vaccinations and more about people making judgments on your roommate, like personal attacks. 

I believe your roommate has reasons for feeling the way they do, and they probably think they're good reasons. They think they're doing the right thing. Although at times, when angry, it can be tempting to just vent that anger at the other person, that makes them more likely to stop listening, shut down, or end up escalating things. Makes it seem like maybe we don't even think they're acting in such a way that they think they're doing the right/safe thing to do. Makes it seem like they're stupid and they'll never not be stupid. People are wrong all the time and make mistakes, but that doesn't necessarily make them bad people, or that they have to keep being bad people if they are bad people. Think about how many things any one of us has probably said or felt in the past that we now know better or feel very differently about. 

If your roommate thinks they're doing the good thing and the right thing, then theoretically, if they reach a point where they recognize that there is another course that it a better one or the right thing, they would want to do that instead. They'll still be doing the right thing as far as their (then current) perspective is concerned, but they'll be more and better informed with sources to support their beliefs. 

Isn't that what a large number of people would want, especially people that pursue disciplines like sciences and engineering fields? You alter your theories and actions based on evidence. Either huge numbers of professionals and specialists are wrong and a significant amount of that data is bad or poorly interpreted, or they believe they know better than all of those people, based on whatever sources they alone have looked at.  They feel whatever evidence or studies they cite that support their own beliefs outweigh the huge number of studies and metaanalyses that say otherwise. 

Personally, I highly doubt I'd ever be in a situation where I felt like I was more correct than an aggregate of people that gather and analyze relevant data as their way of living,  given I'm just a layperson that studies a different science and have much less experience with statistics. If I was in doubt about something, I'd go with the law of numbers. Statistically speaking, it's more likely that it's correct than the alternative. And https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_the_crowd

Not saying ""experts"" or people working in a given field can't have wacked up or incorrect beliefs, but I'd feel more confident about a peer of theirs being able to counter their arguments than I would feel about countering them personally, and I would find a group or the majority of their peers more likely to be correct than a single peer or a layperson. 

I looked it up, even someone as controversial as Dr. Oz recommends flu shots. Going back at least as far as five years ago based on a very quick search. I personally dislike him and he has been discredited by various parts of the medical community for various claims or advice over the years, but he and I at least agree on flu shots. 

Edit: If anyone thinks any of what I've said is very roast-y, know that I made a concerted effort to be as nonemotional or non-savage as possible. Trust me, if I were being fully open or actively trying to roast someone, there would be an EXTREMELY obvious difference. 

Oh, and just because he's never had the flu shot/hasn't ""needed"" one, most of his relatively short life he's been in a prime state for immune system health. Just because he hasn't gotten the flu before doesn't mean the shot won't be of any benefit, or that it's guaranteed he'll keep being safe even if he continues to abstain. Him not getting the flu shot is not the cause of him not getting the flu. They are unrelated and coincidental. Honestly, especially since a flu shot can't offer you complete protection, I get my shots more for humanity at large and for people who can't get them than for myself. I could get the flu regardless of whether I get the shot, but at least if I get the shot it's helping others and reducing the likelihood, possibly even the severity and duration, of my flu symptoms.

The wisdom of the crowd is the collective opinion of a group of individuals rather than that of a single expert.

A large group's aggregated answers to questions involving quantity estimation, general world knowledge, and spatial reasoning has generally been found to be as good as, but often superior to, the answer given by any of the individuals within the group. An explanation for this phenomenon is that there is idiosyncratic noise associated with each individual judgment, and taking the average over a large number of responses will go some way toward canceling the effect of this noise. This process, while not new to the Information Age, has been pushed into the mainstream spotlight by social information sites such as Wikipedia, Yahoo!

comments,"I had some friends who withdrew for a semester for various reasons, and that process always seemed much smoother and less traumatic than getting dismissed. If someone is really struggling, especially due to depression or other mental issues, I’d personally recommend leaving for a bit (I understand this isn’t always an option, but if it is, definitely consider it). Tech is incredibly stressful, and as a community it can seem to feed into negative feelings. Not saying I don’t love the tech community, but having that many high strung, nervous, overworked 20 year olds together isn’t always great for improving your mental health. If someone has multiple sequential bad semesters and doesn’t feel like they’ve got the reason for it under control, I’d recommend taking some time off rather than sticking until you get dismissed. If they can, going and seeing a therapist that didn’t make me wait a month for an appointment did wonders for me after I left. 

I guess I don’t have a great answer on when exactly I think someone should think about voluntarily withdrawing like you asked, but I do think more people should consider taking a semester off at least. It’s Georgia Tech! There’s no shame in graduating a little later, and it’s better to take a semester off and not pay tuition (maybe even get a part time job, make some money!) than to spend a semester failing every class.

For me, I would highly recommend to the 1-on-1 tutoring offered by the Academic Success Center (it'll probably be hard to get an appointment this semester, but you should absolutely try for early next semester). I went in and they helped me really solidify MUCH better study habits (like breaking up your time and planning everything out- they gave me a calendar which had a break down of every hour in the week, and I filled it out and it showed me I had a lot more time than I thought I did). When they explained how to properly study (based on data from research on effective studying), what they were saying seemed like it was really just common sense, but it's not at all how most Tech students end up studying.

Sorry this isn't really a direct response to your post, but I thought it might help you or somebody else get on top of thier stuff and not feel like they're just drowning in work and not able to get out of it.

comments,"Well, sort of depends. Did you apply for a position in Atlanta? Or was it just a general internship and they just happened to place you in Atlanta?

If it's the former, you're out of luck- you should've applied to the one in New York. Asking after you applied for an Atlanta internship is like asking for a different job right after you've been hired for one.

If it's the latter, you can just ask your hiring manager. If there's space in New York and you fit the criteria, they may grant you that opportunity. If not, they'll just say no, there's no space in New York and that you'll have to be happy in Atlanta. Nothing unprofessional about asking here.

Really, it comes down to whether you applied/implied that you'd be going to Atlanta. If there's no indication that you did, it's safe to just ask.",positive,0.9549,positive,0.19148074148074146,11/28/2018

comments,"Maybe suicides are under-reported in religious communities due to cultural reasons? Or maybe people who are suffering aren't even given that option because it's a 'sin' to commit suicide?

Suicide by itself isn't bad, it's how it hurts people that is. Depressed people who are religious, if they don't find support within their spiritual group, might be even more trapped than secular people in a similar situation, as they believe (in certain sects) that they're going to suffer for eternity for expressing their ""free will"".

&amp;#x200B;

I have several papers that say otherwise, it's not nearly as simple as ""religion good, secular bad"". It's much more likely that the social reasons often entwined with religion is the cause of decreased suicide rates.

&amp;#x200B;

What you are doing is the equivalent of me saying that the rate of childhood abuse in many religious communities (most famously the catholic church), is due to their religion, and not due to the power structure.

&amp;#x200B;

Just because you believe in a higher power that there is no evidence for and it helps you doesn't mean that you should encourage other people to believe in such irrational things. I'm not saying there is no higher power, but there sure as hell isn't any compelling evidence.

Professional help, whether is be therapeutic or chemical, is the most effective way to treat mental illness.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't mean this to be an attack on you, but rather on the concept of using prayer because some higher power will save them. This allows people to not take responsibility for themselves and others, which is exactly what we don't need.",negative,-0.8865,positive,0.08837797619047619,11/28/2018

What you're saying isn't strictly anti-vaxxer, but the way you're saying it is. Looking through your comment history, you clearly are antivaxx.

Sorry for the confusion, we will be bringing this up with the Technique's marketing team to ensure that this issue does not happen again in the future.

At worst, you now have work experience, which you can leverage into other internship opportunities down the line (especially with companies you want to work for).

Also- try not to burn any bridges. At this point in our careers (as current students), it's hard for us to really know what we want and what we don't want. I accepted an early offer for a co-op for a small-middle size company and I absolutely love it, despite later receiving offers from other, larger, more well-known companies.

Why does PTS dedicate employee time and resources to ticketing cars without a permit in half-empty, non-residential lots after hours and on weekends?  I understand ticketing in full or close-to-full lots to ensure that those who paid for a pass can find a spot, but nearly all of the lots that I pass by when walking through West Campus on nights and weekends are nowhere near full capacity.  I hate to say it, but I really can't see this practice being anything more than a cash grab; I'm hoping someone from PTS can enlighten me.    
On a separate but related note, given all of the concerns related to student safety both on and in the vicinity of campus, it seems to me that these employees and resources could better serve the Georgia Tech community in the evening by offering some sort of ride-home service (like Stingerette but with parking enforcement vehicles) to students that would otherwise be walking home.

If you've got a legitimate gripe, it's the Duke/UNC/Pitt argument where we dropped way too many of the games we *should* win. Hell, 2014 our two losses were Duke and UNC.

comments,"&gt;This should irritate the hell out of us, and yet here we all are being complacent and saying it's good enough.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not complacency, its being realistic.  The monetary costs of a nationally competitive football program are tremendous.  Based on 2017 numbers, UGA is #3 in the country for spending the most annually on their football program at [$38.9 million](https://www.syracuse.com/orangefootball/index.ssf/2017/08/which_schools_spend_the_most_on_college_football_where_does_syracuse_rank.html).  GT is #61 in the country (and #14 of 15 in the ACC) at [$17.4 million](https://accsports.com/acc-news/how-much-acc-schools-spend-football/).  And that is the money they are *publicly reporting*.  Even looking within the ACC, you have FSU (#2 nationally) at $42.5 million and Clemson (#10 nationally) at $34.7 million.

&amp;#x200B;

I love GT football, but spending an additional $20 million dollars a year on football seems like sending good money after bad.  I am extremely proud of being a GT alum, and I would rather The Institute's priority remain being a world class place higher education rather than a football powerhouse.

&amp;#x200B;

After watching the boring mediocrity of Chan Gailey as an undergrad, I have always been a fan of CJP.  I hope he enjoys his well-earned retirement.  IMHO think we have a far greater chance  of being worse off without CJP at the helm than with him.

comments,"As someone with a severe case of ADHD and who’s been through exactly what you’re describing I can give a few pieces of advice:

1. ADHD meds: Yes, anxiety is a huge side effect for many people with ADHD medications, it can be crippling, but in my experience the absolute worst thing you can do is go off these meds. In cases of genuine ADHD these meds are fundamental to living a normal life. ADHD is an executive function disorder, and without a baseline increase in stimulation planning, working memory, commitment and even emotional regulation drop off the map. With ADHD your prefrontal cortex severely lacks in dopamine, and so the portion of your brain usually specifically tuned to respond to stimuli with appropriate and calculated dopamine production produces massive spikes. This is the distractions, the inability to focus, the loss of clarity and the times you just can’t help going from perfectly fine to crying for hours  at a slight emotional trigger. Medications defragment your executive functions, they allow you to live a structured life. I used to take my meds only on weekdays or only when I needed to study, but trust me, take them daily, when your supposed to. Establish a ritual and it will get your life in a better place.
So what do you do about anxiety? Not an easy question. It’s likely that all stimulants used to cause ADHD will cause the same anxiety for you, (it’s that way for me) so changing meds won’t likely work. The answer is therapy. I know it’s not easy for everyone to get therapy or even possible, but it is 100% your best bet. A good therapist will teach you coping mechanisms and productive strategies for managing and structuring your life so that you still have fun, feel good, and don’t get behind on work. They’ll teach you how repetition establishes rituals that improve the work you do and make your life easier and less frustrating, and they’ll address the route causes of your anxieties and teach you coping mechanisms so that when your meds kick in you can use metacognition to recognize how you’re feeling, why your feelingly, and what you can do to erase that anxiety quickly.

2. Restart. Start next semester and apply to medically withdraw retroactively from last semester. It’s not the end of the world and you’re likely not going to be able to fix this semester at this point. That’s okay, you can’t be expected to suddenly know how to handle all that college is all of a sudden. That’s unfair. That’s not human. Take a breath, accept that things didn’t work but don’t blame yourself, and help yourself move forward. I’ve been in exactly your shoes. I know what it’s like. This isn’t the end for you, there’s always a second chance, and a third, and a fourth and so on. You take your punches, you acknowledge the loss, you learn from what happened and you ask for help. Then you go back into the fight better prepared. You’re absolutely capable of this! You just can’t do it on your own, and that’s okay! We’re social animals. Nobody got where they are on their own no matter how much they like to make it look like they did. You got into tech! That’s damn impressive! Now go do something even more impressive and more rewarding by learning how to better yourself and *succeed* here!

Also, if there’s any way I can help or any more specific advice you’d like then PM me! I’ve been there, it’s rough, and I’d rather nobody have to go through that alone like I did if I can help it.

First semester of my sophomore year my moms Ovarian cancer took a hard turn for the worse. It was early November and past the withdraw deadline.

This is a fairly common reason to withdraw (unfortunately) and yet it was still difficult. I HIGHLY doubt they will be any more willing to help you with mental illness and depression than they were to help me with as my mom was slowly passing away.

The former AD loved the fact that CPJ was doing more with less he was taking 3 and lower 4 stars and winning with them. You’re right Russell blows and the fact that any team would sign a contract with them for as long as we did is outrageous. I’m actually pissed we saigned with Adidas because nowadays that’s like signing with Reebok. With Nike and UA out there. You’re right you can’t hide players like UGA does I bet I can find most all their skill players in a business class and I know for a fact Blankenship is in a journalism class or something. So yes. On that point you are right. But looking at what we did on offense scoring points that’s great we also played some weak defenses and when we played real team UGA and Clemson we scored 42 to there what should’ve been 100 a piece. And that 21 points against UGA was 7 until like the 4th. Same with Clemson. First time we beat them I thought this could be the beginning of something great I was there in 08 in the student section of UGA happy as fuck. And the next year we won the ACC title. But then as CPJ’s recruiting classes started coming in you saw the up and down roller coaster begin. He might not be the whole problem but his
Offense was a big part of the problem. Everyone in America sees it you can ask any analyst in the business why does Tech not get playmakers. “Because players don’t want to play in that offense” and  “players for the defense don’t want to play with that offense”. This is where I get to argue with you about stat padding and how rankings aren’t always the best way to judge something. This season we played bowling green Alcorn state and louisville all three teams even tho Louisville is power 5 are all straight garbage. We put up 60+ against bowling green and Louisville and 41 against alcorn. Only other game we eclipsed 40 was VT a rivalry game another team that really wasn’t all that good. Eat of the season we eclipsed 30 points 3 times. USF we lose by 11 Virginia right at 30 and UNC another crappy school at 38. Now we get to our other 4 losses Duke, Clemson UGA Pitt. 14 21 21 19 under 20 points per game to 2 inferior teams and 21 to superior teams in garbage time. Just because they scored 35 a game doesn’t mean we were that good on offense.

comments,"I'm sorry to hear that! I know graduate school apps can be really stressful and I'm sure this isn't helping. I believe it is possible to write a letter of recommendation in the time remaining (I've had professors write and edit in a day), and I have heard only negative results in writing your own letter of recommendation, so I'd hold out hope for your original plan. Here are a few things that can be done.

1. Give them relevant documents to your application including : resume, an outline of what you wrote for your research essay, details about why you're interested in that particular graduate school etc. etc. If the graduate school in question has a website which includes tips for recommenders when writing letters, let them know about that as well (I know the Goldwater scholarship has one - [https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/recommendation-tips/](https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/recommendation-tips/) . You can send them the Goldwater tips too, I think they really apply in general.)
2. Go to their office and see them in person sometime before Friday. If they are teaching a class, office hours are a perfect time (though you might have to wait out a few students), but if not, then you can drop by their office a few times to determine if your professor has a few minutes for you. If you can catch your professor before Friday, give them the documents mentioned above by hand and remind them the deadline is this Saturday.
3. And lastly, if it helps alleviate stress, I know some graduate schools are a bit lenient with deadlines, especially when it comes to letter of recommendations.

comments,"From the GT Director of Parking, Glenn Kurtz:

It is the definition of an “effective and I would argue an efficient parking management system.’  We have approximately 28,000 faculty, staff and students that come to Georgia Tech each day.  Of that 28,000, approximately 14,000 have permits.  These 14,000 permits park in approximately 12,000 parking spaces.  That is an oversell of approximately 20%.  In addition, we have thousands of non-permit holders (daily and special event visitors) that come to campus on any given day and they also park in the same 12,000 spaces. If PTS had to build a different parking space for each permit holder and visitor it would require an addition few thousand parking spaces at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.  This would be paid by permit holders and visitors.

Please note that the $800 per year customers pay for parking is almost half the market rate and that is a direct result of overselling parking to permit holders, visitor and special events.  PTS has actually estimated that if we did not generate any visitor parking or special event parking revenue the cost of the annual permit would go up approximately $500 per year.  Although not available to students, if a faculty member wanted a reserved space that they could park in whenever they wanted or needed (24/7) we sell those for $1600 per year.

If you want to learn more about what efficient parking management is all about please check out the links below.

Unless people are actively doing this sort of stuff as a business level punishment for an institution handing out free degrees, then the prestige of the degree literally doesn't matter. Or at least it's not impacted by certain academic concessions.

I'm just talking from a pure systems analysis standpoint here.

Only homework assignments, lab reports, course projects, demos, studio reviews, and presentations listed on a course syllabus at the beginning of the semester may be made due on the two Final Instructional Class Days.  No quizzes or tests may be held on those days and those that have been given previously should be returned with grades on or before Tuesday, December 6, the last day of classes.  

No required class meetings, quizzes, tests, or any other assessments may be held during the Reading Periods.  These times are preserved for student preparation for exams.  Any materials from voluntary review sessions or similar activities held on these days must be made available on the same day to students who cannot attend.

Faculty may also NOT schedule anything other than a final exam (or an assignment substituting for it) during Exam Period.  Take home exams should be made due at the end of a course’s scheduled exam period.

For one, we have a vocal minority who likes to back in to their space.  We have heard them loud and clear and are working on creating a front plate option which will allow them to back in again.  We hope to have these available next semester.  In addition, we have eliminated the issue of customers losing their permits or failing to display their permits which was an ongoing issue.  We are also finding that it is more efficient operationally.  With regard any cost saving, whether it is with virtual permits or more efficient lighting or anything else for that matter all of this is passed on to our customers.  This is also the case when we generate additional revenue from visitor parking and/or special events.   The annual permit at Georgia Tech is almost half of the market rate.  This is due to PTS operating an efficient and effective parking system.  As a matter of fact, PTS has not increase annual permit fees for the past 3 years and do not expect to do so next year.

comments,"&gt; Well, in that case, what's the point of having a football team made up of students to begin with?

The truly-banal-yet-mostly-true answer to this question is to sell tickets, advertise the school, foster institutional unity, alumni outreach, promote alumni social networking, and because it's fun to watch football.

&gt; Why not just have the whole team be made up of non-degree seekers? Just give athletes a platform to use as a stepping stone to the NFL.

This is what every other football factory school does, including Clemson and UGA. 

So if we're going to play this game, we have to understand that the game is rigged. And we have to either accept that our outcomes are going to be at least partially subject to the rigging of the game, which would be fine but our ceiling of success will be lower, or we have to buy in to the stuff the other schools are doing to rig the game, and pay for the higher ceiling by doing the things that they're doing. There's no third option.

What frustrates me about GT fans, particularly the alumni, is they don't understand this, aren't willing to adjust their expectations, and get all pissed off that we aren't competing with UGA and Clemson. 

I'm fine with either one, by the way. I'm fine with us playing this rigged game with one hand tied behind our backs, while maintaining lower expectations. I'm fine with doing all the ancillary stuff to play the game at the top tier, and basically being an NFL farm team. Either of those decisions are fine by me. What's not fine, and drives me crazy, is thinking we can somehow do both and getting all pissed off at the coach because he can't regularly beat Georgia with one hand tied behind his back.",positive,0.7656,neutral,-0.021388888888888884,11/29/2018

comments,"**Tl;Dr:** it's very possible to land an internship or co-op IF you put the time and energy into your applications/preparations. GPA can be important for some companies, but is usually ignored past a certain point. Employers look for a mix of different things, depending on company.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a CS major (chemE), but have many CS friends. We all have had internships/co-ops, but you can take my advice with a grain of salt. GPA MAY be a factor for some companies, but a majority of companies don't really care past a 3.0, with the exception of very prestigious companies. Even then, project work, passion, and personality trump  that atleast 80% of the time.

A couple of tips (this applies to all majors):

1) Apply to EVERYTHING. Especially if it's a first internship. You can't be picky with your first internship. Better to have 4 offers with companies that you ""don't care for"" than 0 offers from jobs you expected to get.

2) Learn how to sell yourself. If there's an opportunity for mock interviews/elevator pitches, do them. Some people are naturally gifted at this. Some people aren't. Don't handicap yourself by not practicing.

3) Make sure you're doing stuff on campus. Some companies might be really interested that you developed a video game in vgdev. Some companies want to see leadership positions in clubs as a sign that you take initiative. Maybe you decided to create a website because you were bored. Or maybe an app that does x. Bottom line- go do something. It's a resume booster and, more importantly, gives you things to talk about.

4) Please please PLEASE get your resume checked before career fair/submitting online. Crappy resume = severe handicap. It doesn't have to be the standard GT resume template, but make sure formatting and grammar is consistent.

Given the number of people with internships and co-ops, both within CS and outside, it is 100% possible to get an internship. If you put your mind to it, I'm sure you'll land one.",positive,0.9811,positive,0.15408986175115208,11/29/2018

Improving living conditions on campus is another big one, but self-care is also very important.

I know a large number of people who have switched from CS to CompE for this reason; many of these, due to extracurriculars, I think are far superior in actual hardware design than any ECEs only focused on taking courses.

However, in the higher level classes that you are able to take as a CompE, you find an intersection of the software-oriented parts, but also have the opportunity to take classes such as control system design, emag and its various applications such as antennas, and various fundamental techniques. It is only this year that I've developed a strong appreciation for this, and find it to be strongly lacking in Devices thread CS counterparts.

comments,"A couple of things to consider:

Campus housing is expensive.  It isn't that far off what you'd pay if you were living on your own (it might actually end up cheaper than many 1 bedrooms once you factor in the cost of utilities), but you pay it up front once and then you don't worry it until the next semester.  Most problems are handled by housing and you have the option of moving or swapping rooms if you find that you're not compatible with your room/dorm mates.

&amp;#x200B;

Living off campus requires you to 'grow up' a little bit.  You'll have to find a place to live, perhaps negotiate the terms of the lease (rent, deposit), and then either sign up for utilities yourself, or if you have roommates, manage who is signing up for what.   Besides paying your rent every month, you will have bills.  Electricity every month, water every two months (Fulton county does it this way), internet and maybe a gas bill or cable TV (though I hear that cable is not a thing with you young'uns).   KEEP IN MIND that living off campus means that you need a form of transportation other than your feet.  Bird scooters, Lyft/Uber weren't around back in my day, but you'll need a way to transport yourself to and from campus and also a way to forage for food (usually at a supermarket).   If you have a bicycle then you'll need a way to secure it.  automobile means gas, tag fees, insurance, and a place to park.   Also, you will also have to figure out a way to get along with your roommates if you have any because breaking a lease to move somewhere else typically involves a financial penalty and having to start this entire process over again.   Also, unlike GT Housing... many landlords used to renting to college students are crappy people who will find any/ever reason to keep as much of your security deposit as possible.  

&amp;#x200B;

Unless you can find a cheap'ish place near campus, or have access to cheap/free transportation then living off campus can be a wash in terms of finances.   The money you save on rent is eaten into by MARTA or gas or eating out more often and time spent traveling.    The upside is that once you've done it a couple of times and figure out what you're doing, you have more freedom with how/where you can live as long as you're willing to put in the time and effort of finding a great place or good roommates.

&amp;#x200B;

I would highly recommend living in &amp; around other college students.   Its usually a more social atmosphere and there is a lower chance of an odd class/study/recreate schedule (or lack thereof) bothering them.  ",positive,0.9382,positive,0.1555779220779221,11/30/2018

Is the professor doing anything untoward in grading, or is course simply difficult? I know it might be unfortunate for you, but if it is the latter, not sure what the issue is. As someone who's a bit older and farther removed from college, going above the instructor's head to the department chair because you don't like your grade is probably not the best route. No one is entitled to an A in a course. As for the students worried about their chances at grad school, if they think this professor's comments are harsh, just wait until you enter into a master's or PhD program. It may be more productive to look at why specifically you are not doing well in the class, rather than your final grade, or blaming the instructor.",negative,-0.9736,neutral,0.021666666666666674,11/30/2018

comments,"I have homework due this afternoon that I finished last night rather than this morning.

I have great friends.

I have a great family.

I like my apartment.

I have pretty good grades going in to finals.

Georgia Tech campus is beautiful.

I also have a cute dog.

But the important thing is that even if I didn’t have some of the above I would still be happy. As Miller Templeton says, don’t let happiness be the prisoner of your doing. It can sometimes be tough when you have lots of work or someone you talked to last week killed themself, but at any point if you look you can find things to be happy about. If you remember to be thankful for those things, your problems don’t seem so bad.

When I was in high school my school newspaper raised money by having us voluntarily help Aramark cater u\[sic\]GA games (I never said I was proud of my past).

In my personal experience, Aramark practices very poor hygiene. I've seen countless crates of food destroyed by rats, as well as very poorly cleaned cooking equipment. This trend, along with the general poor quality of food provided, lead u\[sic\]GA to drop them.

comments,"PTS charges for parking on Georgia Tech’s campus 24 hours a day 7 days a week to recuperate the costs to maintain and operate the parking system.  We do not make a profit.  These costs to maintain and operate the system include the following:

· Debt service on our parking deck (we presently have 14 parking decks on campus),

· Maintenance on the lots which includes restriping, repaving, replacing the expansion joints, repairs to spalling in the deck, waterproofing, etc. etc., and

· Operation of the entire system which includes emptying the trash cans, paying for the electricity to light the decks, management, etc. etc.

On nights and weekends these costs still remain.  Sure the costs are less because there is less occupancy but it is not zero.  As a result, we offer a nights and weekend permit that is less than an annual permit (starting @ $235).  In other words, we offer different price options based on how often you use the system or how much wear and tear you place on the system.  Everyone who drives shares in paying something for the privilege to park on campus.  Let’s say we made the parking system free on nights and weekends.  This would require that the people who park during the day would be subsidizing the people that park at night.  If this did not come out of the parking permit fee it would have to come out of the general fund.   In other words, someone would have to pay for it.   This goes for visitors and special events as well.

I do not know why the University of Florida allows free parking at night but I would argue that it is not fare to those that park during the day.  If you want to read more about the cost of parking I would recommend you read the “High Cost of Free Parking.”  It’s not specifically about Colleges and Universities but it does touch on many of these issues.

If you want to chat more about this I am happy to do so .- Glenn Kurtz , I can be reached at 404-894-3010.",positive,0.9849,positive,0.1920496894409938,11/30/2018

comments,"Reach out. Sometimes people are too afraid to put in the time and effort to become close, and you have to be the person that makes that extra effort. I've had to kind of push and shove and really sacrifice my own time to make friends with people here, and haven't had many go out of their way for me. In the end it paid off and now I have good friends who look out for me too, but it didn't start that way.

I made friends with people who were friends with people in their immediate vicinity, meanwhile most of the time I've had to go out of my way to find those people. It takes a lot of courage, but good friends are worth it. You just gotta come to terms with the fact that some people, no matter how much time and effort you give to them, won't become close friends with you. Keep being positive as there are people who will become close friends with you.",positive,0.991,positive,0.32727272727272727,11/30/2018
