comments,"My issue was I usually never had an early enough time ticket to get my first choice professors.  Even as a *senior* in my penultimate semester - this one professor for ME 3017 (which most people take as 3rd or 4th years) had a 22-person waitlist when my time ticket opened up!  I still had a good experience in another section, but that's how registration for non-lab classes usually went for me.

This is why I'm salty because of the time ticket system.  I get that it's easy to prioritize based on credit hours alone, but it gives an unfair advantage to people who could take AP/DE credit ahead of time, and it does little to reward graduating ""on time.""  This is annoying to an out-of-state student.  Maybe it would be better if there was a limit to the number of outside credits that would count for registration, at least for incoming 1st years.",positive,0.9543,neutral,0.03805555555555554,02/28/2021

comments,"This is an immensely short tl;dr that probably leaves out something important but should help you figure out what to search to learn more :)

&amp;#x200B;

A simple website is basically a collection of webpages that have links to one another. 

There are usually 3 languages we use to make a website page: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The first two are mainly used for layout; they just say what stuff should be on the page (HTML )and what it should look like (CSS). If we want the stuff to do things on the page (move around, switch text depending on the person's name, etc.) we use Javascript.

&amp;#x200B;

As for hosting, Github Pages is a pretty cheap way to host (free hosting, you would only have to buy a domain name if you want a custom one). It can cover a lot of the simple use cases

I would say the best way to start learning how to make a page in raw HTML and build up from there (think of a cool thing you want on your site and figure out how to put it there).",positive,0.9818,positive,0.23349358974358975,02/28/2021

Once again going off memory, a lot of the student offerings in midtown and rent in general for apartments in midtown and atlantic station will fall around that price level.  (Assuming subleases of a larger unit.  1br/studios can be very expensive)

Fact checking myself: It looks like GT is charging $4829 per semester for fall/spring terms, and given that move in/out dates are right before/after the semester begins/ends (ignoring the winter break if you sign for both fall and spring), that's just over 4 months each so we could consider that about $1200/month",positive,0.8184,neutral,-0.011428571428571432,02/28/2021

* Intel Core i7 9750H (6 core 12 thread)
* 16GB DDR4 RAM (upgradeable)
* NVIDIA GTX 1650
* 512GB M.2 NVMe SSD (upgradeable)
* 99 Wh battery
* 1080p IPS display (no touchscreen)

I paid $1700 for it when it was brand new in 2019, definitely worth it especially with Dell's warranty. I use Autodesk Inventor and unless I'm doing something stupid I don't have any issues. The GTX 1650 is on par with my GTX 970 in a desktop, so I've been able to play GTA V at high settings without any issues. 

The battery life is also solid, 99 Wh is the max allowed on an airplane so you're getting the most of what's available. The advantage of going with the 15"" version aside from the larger display is that both the memory and the storage are upgradeable.

Tech should move towards being “challenging AND engaging”. Not like the bs in the brochures but actually engaging in that way we have more surveys on mental health (and USE the data), we have more seminars and speakers come and talk about mental health. Engaging in the sense that we build a community where people don’t feel isolated in a school of thousands. Engaging in the sense that periodic mental health check-ins/breaks are REQUIRED in every class the same way assessments and assignments are required. So what if it’s not like that in the “real world”. We are the real world and the real world is changing as we speak.

And if you are a student who doesn't have food insecurities, or a student who is not a veteran needing special services, or a student who isn't in financial crisis needing emergency funding because of COVID-19, or a student who doesn't have to worry about affording something decent to wear for an interview, or a student who isn't lacking funding to attend a professional conference or special training program or other major-related event that would be really beneficial, then GOOD FOR YOU, and the very least you can do is not be dismissive of an organization that is trying to help your fellow students who do have these issues. If you think asking parents to voluntarily spend $35 (or not, their choice) in support of these programs by sending a silly box full of silly things to their kid, who probably won't be nearly as offended or angry as you are, is somehow ""insensitive"" and ""giving the majority of the student body the finger"" then you are showing an arrogance, immaturity and entitlement that needs some serious self-reflection.

comments,"A note: this contains some stuff about what happened last week that not everyone will want to read, so if that’s you, stop here. 

I saw what happened last week probably about 30 seconds after they jumped. The first cops got there and ran over to the person. On the top level of Willage there was a student walking around on the phone, hands on his head. I spent most of that night thinking they had died- I had watched long enough to see when the ambulance got there they pulled the stretcher out, one of the cops when over to say something to the EMTs and they put the stretcher back in the ambulance. A little after that I left my room and went to work in another building for a few hours- I had work to finish that night and I didn’t want to have to keep looking out my window, seeing all the police cars and the person still lying there. I called some family that night and told them about what I saw and a few days later I told some of my friends about it. I can’t even explain how much that helped- to know that I wasn’t alone and could talk to someone else about it and they would support me. If you have anything in your life that causes you pain like this just telling another person about it can help so much, to know that other people care about you. And don’t say “well there’s no one I could talk to”- everybody here knows what it’s like to deal with this kind of stuff and we have stuff of our own to share as well.

Tech is a really tough place. It should be tough, and I like that it is, I can take pride in that. But if it wasn’t just a little bit easier, a little bit more supportive, a little bit friendlier, than maybe it wouldn’t get to this point. Long story short, in your everyday actions try to make GT just a little bit of a friendlier, more supportive, more inclusive place this week, this month, this year, because maybe that’ll make all the difference.",positive,0.9715,positive,0.08211279461279461,03/01/2021

comments,"I’ll concede that higher learning is not the *only* factor, but it does seem to be the largest.  Suicide among college students has been increasing since the 90s and 2000s, before phone use was a thing or common, respectively.

As for GPA increases, I think it’s actually a corollary.  Students study harder, averages increase, professors push more rigor, students study harder, and on it goes.

My hometown has a school about the size of GT.  It’s mostly commuters and nowhere near as “prestigious” as GT.  Suicide just doesn’t happen there because it doesn’t put the same pressure on it’s students.

Don’t get me wrong, I love(d) GT.  But I’m one of the people it nearly destroyed inside.  My quality of life has improved leaps and bounds since graduation and I can’t help but wonder why everything had to suck so much while I was there.

comments,"""  How do I tell the professor about how scared I am?  "" Is this really the primary concern? (How to tell them?) It sounds like they have tried to be helpful, they probably understand most students are concerned about failing.

Assuming the professor is doing what they can to help, other possible sources of help are:

\- Asking other students how they are preparing for the exams

\- Attending TA office hours to get a different approach than the prof's

\- Not sure if classes like you describe have tutoring / PLUS sessions

\- Personally, this helps me, but other students say it stresses them more, but work through calculating your grade (I use a spreadsheet) to properly understand how test scores impact your grade vs other assignments. This helps me when I'm struggling to see that part of my grade is from homework that I can get much better scores on vs the tests. But also helps me feel more confident about whether I need to drop course or not.

Understanding that mental health is a real obstacle is important, so addressing mental health is also important.

Some things that might be helpful (or not):

\- Think through the fear that is stressing you out to the end. Fear: You fail the course. Likely Outcome if that happens: You take the course again in summer or fall, most likely has a monetary cost. That sucks, but is this the end of the world? Probably not. Probably means you will have some more debt to pay off in the future. Hopefully sometime you'd look back on in 2 or 3 years time and think wasn't as big of a deal as it feels like now. (Your actual assessment might be different, the point is to ask yourself 'If the worst happens, what would that look like, and how would I cope with it?')

I think that first step is important to take some of the intensity out of the dread.

Next step is to take the steps you reasonably can to get better at the class now, like you are already doing, but which is hopefully easier to take action on if you can lessen the pressure on yourself from the fear. Even if you end up retaking it, learning it a little better now will help when you retake it.",positive,0.7418,positive,0.10030487804878051,03/02/2021

Gatech is full of lifelong, serious students that weren’t socially enabled much at a younger age. Most aren’t focused on anything but their work, and you can’t blame them for that. Everyone is different. It’s okay to take semester long breaks from it. It’s okay not to like it. It’ll be over soon and you can return permanently to somewhere you enjoy more.

Never give-up on exploring it just because one of its parts carries the emotional diversity of a crouton. Better yet, you never need to actually find anything.

comments,"Some cheaper options: Some therapy apps that connect you to a therapist are much cheaper than in-person therapists, per hour, (although I found the therapist I used for this not as experienced as a more expensive in person one I used in the past.)

Also, many therapists have a sliding scale, based on client income, so even if their rates are normally high, it might be worth inquiring. Especially with COVID, many therapists are doing tele-health, and if this means they stopped paying a lease on professional space, they might be able to be more flexible on price.

Cheapest option of the above don't work (although at minimum I'd recommend looking into doing at least a few sessions with someone, if you can afford like 6-8 sessions it might still help a lot), but reading self-help books can be helpful in conjunction with this. There are books on CBT, stuff like Eckhart Tolle, all sorts of different routes although what appeals to you is an individual thing!",positive,0.904,positive,0.15611111111111112,03/02/2021

Spoiler alert I lived.  I spent a long time wondering if I made the right choice calling my therapist that day.  Did I do the right thing putting my family through the drama of a hospitalization?  Did I waste a bed on the incredibly full unit? After all I didn’t actually attempt.  However, I wholly believe the only reason I am still here is because I was too scared to make the first cut.  I had years of theory, fail safes, back up plans, a timeline, the whole nine yards, which I won’t describe here for obvious reasons.  Last night, I listened to a voice recording I made for one of my good friends 10 days before I was hospitalized apologizing to them for everything, and the hurt I had caused them.  I fully expected it to be my last words.  I hadn’t heard at that point, and part of me wants to believe it was a small act of companionship put out into the universe at a students time of need, but that sounds a little too connected (that’s not the right word, but I can’t think of one rn, I hope you know what I mean).  All of that to say, I have been that kid, I have stood on the edges of buildings and really thought about jumping.  Whoever they are, they have a long road to recovery, both physically and mentally, earlier this morning I would have said after 3 years I was finally past it, but that is not the case.  I’m not nearly as eloquent as OP, mostly because I’m feeling lots of things currently.   But on the off chance that whoever who jumped reads this, or if you are thinking ab ending it, I know how hopeless you are.  I know how bad waking up in the morning hurts.  I know how impossible it all feels.  I know how you see absolutely no light at the end of the tunnel.  I also know what it is to feel like to wake up 3 years later, find my cat sitting on my chest, and call my best friend to congratulate him on his new job.  I know what it feels like to drive around the city late at night listening to all those songs and know every word, but for the pain to be a memory.  My brother is getting married next year, and I will be at his wedding.  I fell in love and had my heart broken.  That line “blah blah darkness….blah blah dawn” yeah we all know it, and it sounds so incredibly stupid, especially when your that low, I know it does.  But I swear on all that is holy, to you, to me, to your best friend, that you do not walk the road alone, and there is light at the end.

&gt;Now, I am not sure we will actually vaccinate 70% of the population due to a worrying portion of the general public not wanting to get vaccinated, but once 70% of the population has at least been offered a vaccine, at that point it is their own fault if they get sick.

which seems to imply that enough of the population will deny the vaccine to not reach the 60%-80% number, but herd immunity would still develop because the vaccine had been offered to (not taken by) them.

While your success so far in HS definitely indicates that you have a future at Tech, the courses you're taking right now are not very indicative of the difficulty here. Most of this school consists of kids who breezed through high school and were quickly forced to adapt their work ethic and time management to accommodate a workload that is IMO at least twice as hard.

You sound a lot like me when I was a Freshman. I think at this stage you should be concerned more with the experiences you're having right now as opposed to what you need to do to prepare for college or a career, stuff that it sounds like you'll already be well prepared for by the time you need to worry about it. Use the free time you are blessed with right now to connect with others; one of the most crucial and uncommon skills at Tech is the ability to build a positive social network. I would argue that you should be far more focused on trying to express yourself through clubs, sports, music etc. rather than worrying about getting a 1500+ SAT score, not just from the perspective of building a college application but from the perspective of enriching yourself and getting to know those around you.",positive,0.978,positive,0.1054730073847721,03/02/2021

comments,"Okay so I’m in my last semester of AE (132 credit hour major) &amp; got a certificate in Astrophysics which is 12 credit hours (15 including a required prerequisite for PHYS 4XXX classes). AE doesn’t teach a lot of physics. No engineering major really does because engineering principles rely on the simplification of physics principles. I liked the physics because it taught me a lot of the derivation processes and assumptions made to make the concepts applicable. However, I will never use any of it again, and physics was so much harder than AE in my opinion. 

If you’re dead set on it, do an AE major with a physics minor. You can do a lot more with an undergrad in engineering than you can with physics &amp; you’ll have better internship opportunities that aren’t just (typically unpaid) research. The physics is interesting but largely useless until you get into a doctoral program. You can also do a physics masters/doctoral program without having majored in physics for undergrad. You’re not locked in one field forever. Also, a lot of engineering companies will pay for your masters or doctorate with the agreement that you’ll continue working for them for 2-5 years after you graduate. 

In addition, AE is a very broad program that covers aerodynamics, structures, avionics, propulsion,   systems etc. You’ll likely end up specializing later in what you find most interesting through research &amp; masters. That will dictate your job prospects. 
A doctorate is really only necessary for research &amp; academia. A masters &amp; experience are going to be much more likely to get you in the door to places like that. A doctorate is more useful to get later once you have established credibility.",positive,0.9595,positive,0.1747685185185185,03/02/2021

comments,"This isn’t in regards to therapy but if you are doing poorly in classes due to mental health issues, you can discuss taking an Incomplete in your classes. An incomplete allows you to finish the class sometime between now and the end of the following semester. It will show up as a letter “I” on your transcript and will be replaced with whatever letter grade you ultimately make. It’s a break with no penalty. 

You can do it for one class, several, or all of them. The only qualifications are that you have to be passing the class (which is rarely checked tbh) and the professor has to agree. Most professors will allow it; nobody wants to see you crumble. Some care less, it’s true, but I’ve yet to meet any who are outright cruel (well one but he got fired *cough* Komerath *cough*). From there, you send an email to the Dean of Students describing the agreement you’ve come to with your professor(s). 

My best advice is to figure out which of your classes has the most assignments and talk to that professor first. If they agree, spend the rest of your semester working on your other classes and being kind to yourself (e.g. sticking to meal and bedtimes like they’re a law you actually care about bc they should be). Then, during semester break and the first 2ish weeks of school during the next semester before your next classes pick up, finish the remainder of your assignments/take the final for your class(es) that you took the Incomplete in. This way you don’t tank your GPA &amp; you don’t pay for a class twice. 

I hope you find a counseling place that works for you! I personally had a hard time with finding a therapist because their first solution was always to take a semester off which would not have worked for me for a variety of reasons. This did. I took an Incomplete, had a lighter semester, salvaged my GPA, got my health back, and realized that life is not out to get me/there are people willing to help. I hope you are able to do the same no matter which direction you go!

comments,"I'm sorry if this may come off unempathetic but with criticism to a problem must come a proposed solution.  

&amp;#x200B;

What are these practicable strategies and programs? From my understanding isn't  suicidal thoughts all up to the individual? What can a college do to discourage such thoughts than what it already has done? It provides resources for you to reach someone if you have such thoughts. Besides that on an institutional level what can they do!  


For example, lets say that the institute wants to promote a ""health""  life style. So, they provided the CRC, dorms, and a lunch hall with healthy options. Then they are criticized because they  don't have all the latest training equipment at the CRC, the best mattresses so that people can get quality sleep, and there healthy options are too limited. One may say they don't care they are doing the bare minimum. While in reality if the student really wanted, the resources provided are more than adequate to live a ""healthy"" life style. **If they wanted to**!

&amp;#x200B;

Likewise, apply this to mental health resources. They may not have the best resources equipped to handle situations. Hence, why more often than not they may refer to off campus resources. Similar to how the school doesn't have to go above an beyond for training equipment they don't have to add some 20+ phycologist to bolster the school's mental health department. The resources they provide are a curtesy. Now i'm a firm believer in put your money were your mouth is so why not contact the school and create an endowment specifically to fund the mental health resources you deem as  appropriate?  


p.s. Sorry if this may seem harsh or coming off as passive aggressive. I'm both playing devil's advocate and truly confused as to what more can the school do in this space.",positive,0.9575,positive,0.16804373787132407,03/03/2021

comments,"I'm old, I've graduated over a decade ago, but the Summer before I attended, my father ran into someone on a flight to Europe who was wearing a Tech sweatshirt, so he engaged him and proudly told him that I was about to attend and he asked what the guy liked most about Tech. His response was, ""Getting out.""

While I enjoyed being a student (not necessarily the grind that is GT education), it is hard to say that GT was ""fun,"" and I can't imagine what it is like now with the lockdown. BUT, I will say this, watching many of my friends drop out and making it out the other side is something I wear as a badge of honor. I'm better for it, and when I have deadlines at work I find them to be trivial compared to a week of exams at Tech. I wouldn't trade my time at Tech for anything, but I didn't enjoy it...

I have friends and relatives who went to schools that were not nearly as difficult, and I won't express my subjective opinion of those schools, but I will say, the things they think are hard in life and at work, just aren't hard, and that is something I can say because I went to Tech.

Also, in HS I qualified for extra time on my exams. I never really looked into that at Tech until my third year. I had heard that Tech offered support for kids with certain disabilities, and I was fairly unscientifically diagnosed with ADHD. I went into the student services building and asked about getting help. The kid at the desk responded by saying, ""You are in your third year and you've made it this far without help, and you want help now?"" I turned around and walked out without help and made it through. If you need help, then you should probably at least talk to the proper person about whether or not you need it and should get it. But, part of what makes GT so good, is that they do have a certain standard. I find myself talking to my co-workers about how hard the interview was, and find that I actually was given a much easier interview because I went to Tech, and they know what to expect from me. If Tech dilutes the experience and difficulty, then that will change and having gone to Tech will mean less.

I coach 10-12 year olds in soccer, and when they want to not work in practice I ask them if they want a team of 3 year olds to show up so they easily beat them because the team puts up no resistance, and they all agree that wouldn't be fun. They would rather beat a difficult team that put up high resistance. And then they realize they need to get back to work, being good isn't easy.

One of my favorite Tech profs. used to say, ""Pay me now or pay me later."" You are all paying now, so you don't have to pay later.

Tech has definitely changed since I've been there, and maybe  my perspective is no longer valid, but these are my 2 cents. And, sorry for my rambling. I hope you all find what you are looking for. I hope you all stick with Tech, and I hope you find happiness. Just because Tech is hard, doesn't mean you can't be happy.

Full Disclosure: I did take some time off while at Tech to figure some stuff out, and Tech supported me doing so. I changed majors while at Tech. I called my father (a math prof somewhere else) crying because of how hard calc was, at least once.

Edit: I just wanted to say, there is nothing wrong with getting help, I actually did while I was at Tech, there is a lot of help and support, but the help and support isn't always trying to find you. If you need help, go look for it, there is more help and support at Tech than you might think. But, this is different than HS (help came to me in HS, so I was surprised at first by what felt like a cold and not caring place like Tech, they do care but they won't come to each student to show it, this prepared me for the real, post-Tech world).",positive,0.9992,positive,0.10564285714285714,03/03/2021

That doesn’t mean we should just make them fend for themselves and tell them they aren’t good enough. Nor do we need to pile on excess stress in the name of “trial by fire”. We can still challenge our students and shape them into great engineers who are competitive, without driving them to constant mental breakdowns or suicide.

comments,"&gt; These guys are making an enormous amount of money off of us, it makes no sense that we should need to give them more money to fund something when we already do give them a lot. The issue is that they want to use it on renovating a perfectly fine student center. 

Maybe i'm not understanding. Is our tuition and etc not already pre-allocated toward paying for other things such as student centers, institute payroll, and etc? I other words we pay tuition to pay our faculty. We pay fees to use resources around campus.    


 My point was for the endowment was this. The institute already pre-allocates money for certain things.  If you wish to add something to the budget then either A, you have to add to the revenue (higher tuition or add a mental health fee) or B cut the budget of another program(think if you truly want this!).   


An endowment on the other hand is money that can only be used for its specific purpose. If you don't create an endowment then you are hoping that the institute will both use the money effectively and care enough to increase those resources in it's budget. 

As you mentioned they prioritize a new student center because when prospective students look at colleges they see a new student center as cool not a highly effective mental health department as cool. Therefore, it's more likely the student will come here and add to the institute both in terms of talent and tuition money. It's a far greater return on investment from a business stand point. Hopefully, that makes sense. While an endowment ties the money specifically with what you want to be done with it.  No admin can just up and say lets use this money for this program to fund another.   


I understand what you are saying but maybe my statement was poorly written. However, in my opinion my argument makes sense which is my 2 cents. If i was an admin i wouldn't divert money from a program to address mental health at Tech i would say it's up to the student to seek help and schedule a visit to a professional.

Right now, teaching is not personal for the large part. It’s on a screen. There’s no personal interactions and very little empathy. That can weigh a ton on a student’s mind when all they see is numbers on a screen instead of a class. 

It’s easy to say “hope it improves soon”, but that just insults the issue. Do I have any solutions? I wish I did. However, I believe the uptick in suicide attempts should at least tell you that this isn’t just “good ole tech”.",positive,0.4588,positive,0.10304487179487179,03/03/2021

You take people that excel in highschool all in one place. People who never once failed a class are now working for hours just to scrape by with a C. You go from the top of you class to below average in just a year. I don’t know if everyone here feels like this though.

Also, I understand the thought process behind no spring break, but it seems that GT forgets we’re human sometimes. Why is the most academically rigorous school in georgia the one that decides to not have spring break. This is asking for mental burnout. And burnout id not solved by a break on a random Wednesday. I guarantee no one is going to be able to genuinely relax when they still have assignments do the next day. GT students are hard workers but not super human.

Lastly, don’t think the academic rigor should take a hit, but I wish it was rigorous for our benefit and not just for rigor sake. Coming here from KSU, the difficulty wasn’t much different, it was just the volume of assignments and the expectation and no wiggle room for mistakes. So instead of actually learning how to think and solve hard problems, I’m just spending all my free time doing longer assignments.

comments,"A lot of students’ mental health issues are related to stress coming from academics - so no it’s not just the individual student’s fault &amp; it’s Georgia Tech’s responsibility to look into policies/actions to make academics less stressful for students. Tech already has the reputation for being unnecessarily difficult, even compared to other top institutions, and while that image is often glamorized to make “getting out” seem like more of an achievement - it can be detrimental to mental health by making it seem like an insane amount of work load/unhealthy habits are the norm &amp; it discourages students from voicing their concerns and makes them almost feel guilty if they complain about academic stress, as well as it gets rid of responsibility from GT admin/professors who are responsible for creating this academic environment and hence partly responsible for the academic stress faced by students. 

The resources they provide are not a curtesy- they’re a necessity/requirement- they would be a curtesy if we didn’t pay for them. However with the huge amount of tuition we pay (esp out of state/intl students for whom it’s harder to access off-campus resources) and compared to other top institutions, our mental health resources need to be much better. 

I agree w you that we need to spend more time/effort on implementable solutions, but that responsibility should fall on GT first before its students. I think the solution you mentioned has been discussed before but idk what happened with it. Also it’s not like GT doesn’t have enough money, it’s just that they’d rather spend it on something else - so idk if they’d want/allow an endowment specifically dedicated to mental health resources. Also current students become future alumni- and if you’re treating your students like shit, idk how encouraged they’d be to donate back to the school as alumni, esp if they’ve seen how money is allocated here &amp; have an issue of distrust/even trauma associated with the school.   

Yes some people might be able to excel while being provided the bare minimum/even less than the bare minimum, but that should not be the standard &amp; should certainly not be an excuse for a top institution like GT.",positive,0.9846,neutral,0.03761261261261262,03/03/2021

For your first point, I do appreciate that they hired 3 new counselors. However, in comparison to the size of the student population, they need to hire much much more.

According to zip recruiter, the average salary of a psychologist in Georgia is $92,164 and according to salary.com, the median salary of a “Counseling Psychologist - Higher Ed.” In Georgia is $68,425. The tier 1 Georgia Tech “Psychologist” is 
$64,727 according to hr.gatech, which I assume is most common based off of the high turnover rate. Based off this, Tech still underpays their staff and is not competitive with the average market-rate salary.

However, let’s just say for each additional counselor they add, one less freshman commits suicide. The average student pays $20,814 for tuition, not to mention possible donations down the road. It definitely pays to hire an additional counselor for $64,727.

Not only that. It would cost Georgia Tech $647,270 to pay 10 more counselors. I’ll be generous for recruiting, raises, office space, and whatnot; it would probably cost around $1 million more per year for 10 more counselors.

The fiscal 2019 budget for Georgia Tech Resident Instruction was $1.2 BILLION dollars. I don’t understand how resources could not be redirected/allocated to something that would be 0.083% of the yearly budget.

comments,"&gt;For your first point, I do appreciate that they hired 3 new counselors. However, in comparison to the size of the student population, they need to hire much much more.

The article says they're hiring three more counselors after the recent hires and more support staff. Given that COVID blew up a lot of budgets last year, I'm surprised they're ramping up hiring at all. They should ***definitely*** expand more, but how large should the staff be? According to [open.ga.gov](https://open.ga.gov), Tech employs 17 people with the title ""Counseling Professional"". For comparison, GSU (with a student body over double the size of ours + multiple campuses) only has 13 people with that title.  

&gt;The tier 1 Georgia Tech “Psychologist” is $64,727 

Tier 1 as in entry level? If the entry level psychologist at Tech makes $4k less than the typical psychologist (who may have more experience), that's not necessarily underpaid. At first glance, the median ""counselor"" salaries at Atlanta area colleges are lower than Tech.  

&gt;The fiscal 2019 budget for Georgia Tech Resident Instruction was $1.2 BILLION dollars. I don’t understand how resources could not be redirected/allocated to something that would be 0.083% of the yearly budget. 

Probably because different pools of money are generally reserved for different things and it's not bottomless. If they redirect money from ""Resident Instruction"", you can bet something instruction related will get cut and people will complain about that. 

&gt; Georgia Tech just flat out does not care.

comments," Hey! I'm a second year ME. 

1. The prereq chain is pretty strictly enforced in ME, and I haven't personally seen or heard of any exceptions. However, if you have some time to study for 1553 before the end of the semester, GT does offer advanced standing or placement tests to get out of a lot of the intro math classes, including 1553.
2. As far as taking 12 hours in the summer, do note that since the sem is shorter, you have to do more with less time and classes are generally harder. I took 7 hours last summer while working and that was fairly hard. 
3. Your summer semester plan seems kind of difficult, but here's a breakdown by class:  
Math1553: hit or miss but on the harder end of intro classes  
Me1670: some busy work but easy content wise and most get an A  
ECE3710: from what I've heard this course is hard and more like 3 credits worth of work  
COE2001: statics is very very professor dependent, but very doable for a summer  
Wellness: easy  
IYSE3025(this is one credit and fairly easy, but generally has an even A/B split)                 
I'd recommend taking an elective or some other course over ece if possible this summer

comments,"1. I’m actually not sure if FE is *required* but I do know that just about every first-year does it so I don’t think you can (or should) live in an undergrad residence. 

2. Yes, if you live in a first-year dorm you’d have to move out the next year. Also you probably know this but just to reiterate, first year dorms are “traditional” style which means it’s just one shared 2-person room with 2 beds, 2 desks, 2 wardrobes, and 2 dressers. Everyone on a floor of a building shares a large community bathroom (which might sound bad but honestly I miss it. It gets cleaned every day and you meet people there). There’s also a shared kitchen on each floor. Undergrad buildings are mostly “apartment” style where there are 2 to 4 private bedrooms with 1 or 2 shared bathrooms and a kitchen and common space. There is the one exception of “suite” style which includes Woodruff North, an FE building which has 2 2-person bedrooms and an attached shared bathroom. 

3. Other than the first year, you can choose to stay or move your remaining 3 years (or 4,5...). There are also off-campus options which based on my research are all more expensive or very near the same price with the exception of shared houses (like in Home Park, a nearby neighborhood). On-campus gets you closer to everything so it’s more convenient but if you want nicer living conditions, most off-campus apartments classify themselves as “luxury student living” (not sure how accurate that is though). 

4. The GT Housing application has a very simple roommate finder survey which is about 8 questions where you say how you prefer cleanliness, how often you plan to have guests over, if you plan to use the room for studying or socialization, etc. It then shows you a list of your best matches and you can do your own online research about them to decide if you want to request them as a roommate which they then need to accept. You can also go on Facebook and search for a GT freshman roommate finder group which it sounds like you’re already in(?). I don’t know if the kids these days are still using that, but several years ago each incoming class would make a Facebook group where they post bios about themselves and find roommates. And of course, you can always not make any requests and go random.

5. Glenn and Towers are the most recently renovated freshman dorms (2014 I think?) located on East campus so in that sense people claim they’re the nicest.

comments,"Thanks for sharing these. Part of it is on faculty to communicate their goal is to educate, not assign points. This means holding to not awarding points when they haven't been earned, but also awarding them freely (and not in some curved method) when earned. Basically, if students perceive grades as the metric of learning (they aren't, but if that is the perception), then faculty need to be consistent in their application so students have a clear target. 

Faculty also need to do a better job coaching students to what mastery looks like and helping them understand that working hard doesn't automatically result in a good grade, but the process is valuable. Fear of failure and misattribution of work entitling someone to a grade (as opposed to demonstrating skills and earning a grade) are a lot of the problem, and it is very hard to fix across the institute without consistency, both in professors setting a defined bar and students working to meet it. 

Right now, we have a tendency to promote what students want, which isn't always what they need. GT students are crushed when they don't do something perfectly because they largely haven't failed before. We can help people learn to fail without crisis by letting folks actually fail and make those assignments worth fewer points. It allows students to take risks, but fairly safely. Like training wheels on being a professional where failure can and does happen, and often.

IMHO, it feels like consecutive hurdle races where the officials (professors) keep changing the total distance and hurdle heights at every meet. The runners (students) are both shoving eachother and trying to jump into golf carts to just mow over the hurdles rather than just trying to clear them, as the runners assume getting to the end makes them just as good of a hurdler, simply because they got past the hurdle.

Many students don't know this, but there are national standards for many disciplines. If you are ME, these are ABET. The prof's job is to help you meet those, but they can't unilaterally drop the standard or ignore it altogether if students are not achieving. They should do their best, of course, and departments should hold people accountable, but an instructor can't turn around poor preparation or shitty environmental conditions broadly, especially not in a single semester.",negative,-0.7893,neutral,-0.04960317460317459,03/04/2021

Not blind defense at all, and so you know, there are people all over campus pushing for better (these are often folks in NTT roles, though, as often TT faculty as discouraged from real investment in their teaching, due to the false perception that one must choose). From what I have seen over the years, the longer we keep to CIOS the further we are from efficacy. Part of what is keeping us with that as the measure is student confusion that comfort in a class equals learning; since this CIOS system is gameable by faculty who wish to invest less in teaching, rarely will you see this challenged for this reason (known bias has recently been gaining traction to help move the needle, though). There is a movement by faculty to have better measures, but this has also been stalled by student insistence that their perceptions of learning are equivalent to evidence of it. We all have to work together to change the culture. It isn't a simple problem.

OP says 2-3 tests a week, so say 2.5

a semester runs, what, 14 weeks?

14 weeks \* 2.5 tests/week = 35 tests throughout the semester

**7 tests/class** if OP is taking 5 classes

The best way to get an internship is really just to keep applying to as many positions across multiple job sites like Indeed and Handshake.

To give you some context, I had to apply to over 100 positions to get a single offer, so the process is very tiring and degrading. I believe that companies hire summer interns through the end of March, so I would also advise to speed up your hunt. Good luck!

comments,"Job hunting is inherently stressful because you could be 99% of the way done, and it won't feel any different than 2% until you get the offer and it's a done deal. There's just no way of knowing the actual interest level, or how many people you have made a significant impression upon.

You just have to accept the nirvana of knowing there is nothing you can do but keep putting yourself out there, doing your best, building relationships and connections. The best job hunting you can do is BEFORE you are actively looking. The interactions you have with classmates, peers, and instructors will pay dividends throughout the rest of your career.

Every single job I've ever gotten, including my dream job working here at Tech, was a direct result of specific interactions I had during my undergrad here with classmates, team members, customers I worked with, and instructors who I built a professional relationship with during classes.

I suck at this stuff. Really. If I can do it, any Tech student can.

Don't write anyone off. That ""slacker teammate"" will likely be a successful professional (most Tech grads are, no matter what you think about them now) and might be the gatekeeper you need to get the job you want! One of my ""slacker teammates"" to whom I wasn't particularly nice, because I was an egocentric jerk, owns several Ferraris now. I.. do not.

Also, don't be afraid to apply for an internship that's a little outside your wheelhouse. You may find that, say, you're really good at and enjoy technical writing or training.

These two ""days off"" are going to be spent studying and doing homework (many students have exams the day after either off day). They will not be days off for most of us.

comments,"I've never been much of a believer in hope. It seems mostly comprised of platitudes with no end in sight, just waiting and hoping for things to get better.

To detail, I'll use that sea analogy. It's true the best thing to do would be lie on your back and float for as long as you can. But inevitably, you can float no more. And some people end up drowning because they couldn't find someone in time. Even with their hope and efforts, they ended up drowning. Their ending was the same as someone flailing around or accepting death in the beginning of the scenario.

There's no guarantee things improve. I think to accept that is making a promise you can't keep. It's not something you can guarantee. While I want to think things can get better, what evidence is there to show me that? What do I cling to in order to keep going? How do I actually know it gets better?

I don't. And that's what scares me. The fact that I don't know how this ends, and that despite my efforts what ultimately will happen may or may not be in my hands.

Will I pass these classes with my effort? Maybe. Will I get a job? We can only hope. Will I achieve my dreams? Or will I just wake up from them? I don't know anything anymore. I just want this nightmare to be over.

I reached out to the Dean of Students, so I guess that's a start. But maybe I'm not doing enough somehow, and that my efforts are for naught. IDFK.

* GT is a bubble within Atlanta, which currently sits at around a 11-15% positive rate, but the students will most assuredly be involved in interactions inside Atlanta and within the perimeter. We all know there will be parties with blow, alcohol, weed, Atlanta drug dealers, who have high amounts of contact points, and we know where these will mostly take place at. I personally see nothing wrong with it normally, but in these particular circumstances come on. Let's be fucking realistic.
* As we know by now, college campuses can be a breeding ground for spread, and I feel like this could send the idea that ""all is well"", especially if it's a full normal return, which I'm sure plenty of people will treat is as, at least some large enough set of the students for it to be a problem will for sure.
* I feel the spread will be exacerbated by these factors, and we could be creating the potential for a large outbreak on campus with the tone of the message that was sent out.
* There are several parts of Georgia that are known to be less educated, and I hate to go here but you know that's where the anti-vaxxers are. Spalding county for example",positive,0.9682,positive,0.12532655750047056,03/05/2021

comments,"Hey. You’re experiencing a profound part of being human. Hope is an action. It is active, not passive. You don’t hope for things to get better and just wait. You hold hope, but you also reach out to resources, you look for avenues of relief, you give yourself space and allow yourself some respite. All of these things contribute to hope.  
  
Sure, some people who float and do everything they can to stay alive still end up not surviving... but to intentionally flail or to accept death is to disappoint yourself and your loved ones. You do everything possible to give yourself a little bit more chance - because people do make it out... and a lot of times the difference in making it and not is so small. It’s one decision or one phone call or one cry for help. And you never know if it will be 10 of those from now or the next one that will lead to a rescue boat cresting over the wave on the horizon... but you owe yourself the opportunity to find out.  
  
It’s so hard to keep going, especially when it feels like the tide keeps pushing you adrift... but over the next wave could be your rescue, and you owe yourself and everyone who loves you (and for all of us strangers who want you to make it through) the opportunity to find out.

comments,"I did get accepted after a deferral, it’s possible. But Just because you got rejected from Austin doesn’t mean anything. I know people who got rejected here but got into MIT, the admissions process is flawed and not perfect. In fact, there are people that get accepted places all the time who cheated there way through high school to get there, and who have lists of clubs they put forth 0 effort into on their resume just to look good. Meanwhile, hundreds of people, probably thousands, get rejected each year that would’ve worked 10x harder than the student who didn’t deserve to be there. I can assure you, the only students that don’t think the college admissions process isn’t perfect are the ones who got into their dream college and want to believe they are special because of that. That said, after actually going to college, I’ve learned where you go isn’t as important as people think it will in high school. No college is going to put a limit on the amount of knowledge you gain, in fact, plenty of people go to top schools and slack off. Think about this, go to any college library and no one will ever learn everything that’s inside of it, it’s up to you to learn what you want to learn, more so than up to the college that you go to. And for the specific opportunities you are looking for here, plenty of colleges have similar ones, yah we have some cool stuff, but wherever you go you’ll be able to find stuff that will get you excited. For example, research is big here, but by no means will it be handed to you, you have to seek it out yourself and work to find the right opportunity for you, and I’m sure anywhere you go if you search enough you will find something similar or maybe even better, who knows. I’m just saying, in high school especially, I like many others overrated the WHERE you go to college, and underrated the importance of you as an individual in the learning process and in the process of seeking out opportunities yourself. When I got rejected from my absolute top choice and got deferred here, I was devastated. But now I realize even if I went to my safety schools I would have been in as just as good of a place as here, because from my experience, once you are in college, the where you are going to college is rendered insignificant to your motivation to learn and seek out opportunities as an individual. So I understand your stress and anxiety over getting deferred and rejected, I’ve been there, but no matter what happens, I hope this message helps you understand that it’s ok, and you will do amazing things no matter where you go because of you, not because of the college you go to.

comments,"Note: everyone has their own experience here, so what I’m about to say may or may not apply to you specifically. Also, most of my experience was pre-covid. 

I was fortunate enough to have a good experience overall. As an in-state student, I already had some friends from the same high school, and had a good support system from family and friends. First year, I struggled with my classes. Good grades didn’t come nearly as easily as high school, and that was a wake up call I needed. I got better at my study habits and time management and was able to go through the rest of the years with some social time too. Looking back, I could’ve joined some clubs, but that would have reduced my other social / sleep time, and my time management / procrastination still needed a lot of work for me to be able to pull it off without feeling completely overwhelmed. 

In terms of the CS program specifically, part of it depends on which classes/professors you get, but most of the time it was manageable. There’s always going to be “hell weeks” no matter which major, and it always helps to have a friend in a class in case you miss something. Also, CS TAs and office hours can be extremely helpful, make use of them if you’re struggling to understand the material. Especially early on in the semester, it’s important to get help if you need it, because future concepts in class will rely on a solid understanding of the foundations. 

As for suicide culture: it sucks. I didn’t struggle with it personally, but I know others who have. GT resources aren’t the best, and for my friends still at GT now taking classes remotely during a pandemic, not being able to see your friends or get in-person help has made it even worse. On the flip side, I’ve had many friends not have a problem with it (I recognize this is very fortunate for us). 

TLDR: time management, healthy habits, and a good support system is going to be VERY important to have a good experience at GT. This is a tough school, no doubt even more challenging during a pandemic. Pretty much every program at GT will be difficult, but the value of the education, skills, and degree you earn can be very worth it.

comments,"CS, as well as most majors, are difficult at Georgia Tech. This is partially why Georgia Tech is considered to be one of the best engineering schools in the country. However, with that being said, it is doable as thousands of people graduate each semester.

To be more specific about CS, I  have friends who think it is very easy (they however code in their free time) and others who think it is very hard. I personally think the intro classes are hard, but the later classes get better. However, there are a lot of resources to help you succeed. There is the professor, teaching assistants, tutoring center, YouTube videos and other classmates. Therefore, despite the difficulty, putting in effort will make things be okay most of the time.

Suicide culture does exist, but I wouldn't say that it is worse than in other engineering / difficult colleges in America. Yes, Georgia Tech is hard and puts a lot of pressure on students. Yes, the school is full of very smart people that are able to get a 100, even when the average is a very low. However, putting in the hard work now will make life easier in future, especially with finding jobs.

Keep in mind, the amount of credits you take per semester will make your semester hard or easier. You can take 12 which is the minimum each semester of take a lot more. I  have taken 14 as a minimum and 21 as a maximum. More credits = more work.",positive,0.9698,positive,0.10745670995670996,03/06/2021

Overall, here's my advice. Start all your work the moment you get it, keep a timely schedule of work. Try and be friendly and be open to starting conversations to make friends. Keep a level head when things inevitably go wrong at some point. And don't neglect your mental, nutritional, emotional, or physical wellbeing, because that's where things go really wrong.

The courses I've taken for my other thread - modeling and simulation - have been much less easy. 

There is also a bit of a difficulty curve as you progress through the non-thread courses. I found the jump from Freshmen courses to Sophomore courses to be the most severe.

If you ever find any course topic to be terribly challenging or confusing, consider finding non-textbook resources to explore, including YouTube tutorials for specific algorithms and data structures.

If you can make it through the climb that is Sophomore and Junior years, you can graduate in CS. The rest of your work won't be easy, but your experience in tough courses will make the rest survivable.

Finally, try to find peers in your courses to code with. That has been my most valuable tool for passing the hardest CS courses.",positive,0.5849,positive,0.12996031746031747,03/06/2021

CS is one of the easier majors, the average GPA for classes is 3.5+ according to the official lite.gatech.edu

You can also find specific class GPAs on https://critique.gatech.edu/, and you'll notice that grades trend fairly high these days :)

Out of people I know who took a good number of AP classes in high school / math beyond BC Calc, the vast majority have 3.9+/4.0

comments,"Well... I got a C in a class first semester of grad school (yes, a C, and yes, a graduate class) that was fundamental to my qualifying exams... and I still passed my qualifying exams 9 months later. So that’s my failure but actually didn’t end up hurting me because I continued to be persistent and persevere regardless.  
  
I think what you’re experiencing is normal and common, especially considering the learning circumstances.  
  
Take advantage of the resources you have - like TAs, office hours, and professors’ willingness to support outside of class. You should ask for support (whether that means assignment extension, extra time on an exam, or something like that). No professor wants to fail you - because it reflects poorly on them too - and the worst they can say is “no, sorry”.  
  
Make sure you’re pursuing mental health support outside of academic support. It’s really powerful how tightly they’re coupled and it could help a lot.  
  
Grades are unimportant in grad school, so prioritize working hard and learning - professors care more about those things and you can use your commitment and efforts despite the circumstances as a bargaining chip if you need a little bit of grade bump at the end - remember that undergrad and grad school are different cuts when it comes to grades. Things are a bit more nebulous in grad school.  
  
Also do what you can to cut down on out-of-classroom things like student orgs or things like that - and maybe take fewer classes next semester. I don’t know just suggestions.  
  
You’re discovering where your limits are... and that’s kinda part of the grad school experience. You’re not alone. Use your resources and push through... to the extent that you’re not harming yourself. Take care of yourself first... and the rest will be okay no matter what.

Personally, I think CS varies more person to person than any other major, at least at the beginning. The fact that you can expose yourself to a lot of the material from earlier courses is a huge difference. The gap narrows a bit in the upper level courses when you start getting to things that are more obscure, but a good foundation is always helpful. Point being, you'll find answers ranging from ""I cleared out my Steam backlog freshman year"" to ""I slept less than 1 hour per week per credit I was taking"" and everything in between. My advice would be to treat your courses with respect by default your first couple semesters and believe in yourself.

Negative posts get posted for the same reason why people generally only fill out retail/restaurant surveys or leave reviews when they have a shitty experience. People have much more inclination to share a shitty experience vs share a good experience because being upset drives action.

Negative posts get popular and upvoted for the same reason why the media only reports shitty and depressing and shocking and enraging stories. They get more views and get people to watch/read vs happy stories.

We all cheer for our sports teams and suffer through tough classes together. We all wish that GT took the mental health of its students, especially undergrads, more seriously. We hate how much we're put through and how little time we have to do the things we want to do. We hate how disorganized our classes are. We find a few classes and activities that we really love. We debate giving up, dropping out, switching majors, and wonder if we'll get enough financial aid to complete our degrees. We worry constantly about our future and we sacrifice our current health to do what's expected of us. We find people we care about. We watch those people we care about suffer under the weight of one more exam, one more paper, one more semester, one more all-nighter, one more night spent crying in the culc. We support each other through hard times.

Personally, I had a fantastic few years at Georgia Tech, and I didn't feel like the stress from classes was ever unreasonable. I never pulled an all-nighter to study or finish homework, and I almost always always felt that I had time to pursue hobbies/extracurriculars and spend time with friends. I think part of what worked for me was to start assignments early, take plenty of breaks, and go to sleep when I was tired. I had a great time here, and since starting full-time employment halfway across the country, I miss campus life every day, especially with the COVID situation.

I do agree, however, that the school has severe problems with dealing with the mental health of its students. There were multiple student suicides during my years at Tech, and administration responded to each of them with empty words and bare-minimum promises of improvement that I never saw acted upon. I have a great amount of pride for the school and everything its students and faculty have accomplished, and that's why I want to see them improve. I think it's important for more people like me, who weren't personally affected but still care about others, to speak up. I want to be able to recommend this school to others, because it's provided me with a number of great opportunities, experiences, and lifelong connections, but it's hard to do so without seeing the school's administration prove that they actually care about the rest of the student body.",positive,0.9931,positive,0.13857142857142857,03/07/2021

Whether it’s being a top program in the country, or Tech compensating by inflating our work and deflating our grades, it really doesn’t matter. What makes it worse for freshmen, like myself, is that we come from high schools where the workload didn’t come close. 

If you actually pay attention, most complaints on this sub have something to do with academics. It could be explicit like “why do we have so much homework for class XXX” or more indirect like “online classes make doing this courseload impossible” or “I can’t socialize at all because I’m forced to study all week”. 

The facts are that Tech has woefully adequate living situations, intense schooling, and motivated students.     I don’t know how anyone even remotely affiliated with Tech can think it’s some regular school with regular issues.

It’s obviously an amazing opportunity to attend a school like Tech, but it’s practically impossible not to see it as a us (the students) versus the school. Based on my experiences, I think it’s fair to classify most students views on GT as a love-hate relationship. It’s practically built in to the community to shit on the school, but we earn that right by sticking with it and fighting through each semester. I’ll listen to a GT student shit on the administration all day, but no way in hell am I letting some uGA student do the same. 


Plus Reddit on the whole isn’t a platform I would classify as positive or optimistic. Combining that with the frequent use of the subreddit as a way to vent, its natural for it to develop somewhat of a negative skew.

comments,"I can offer some of my experience here! I had the super fortunate opportunity to co-op as a CS major my freshman summer. I love love love the brand of the company, so I really thought I would have a good time. My role was designed for an IE, but I didn't expect it to be a problem. I completed my first rotation and it was fantastic.   


Then I came back for a second rotation in Spring 2020, and to be honest it was horrific. Watching this company ignore a pandemic and keep its interns working was awful. There were no intern programs to help you meet other interns, the hours we wack, and all interns regardless of majors just worked on Excel and VBA. I am super close to my mentor and she straight up told me that I was better than this company and to do something better instead of coming back for my third rotation.   


The co-op 3-semester contract means nothing and there isn't anything binding you to do it. If you realize you want to be done after one semester, then good. Don't come back and you probably wouldn't want to come back in the future anyway. It is bad-mannered for sure but company feelings don't matter when you realize that this isn't what you want anymore. So go explore, have fun with your summer co-op, and then reassess at the end if you want to come back.

Source? 

&gt;What makes it worse for freshmen, like myself, is that we come from high schools where the workload didn’t come close. 

Is this not true for a subset of students at *any top school anywhere*? Do you think the majority of MIT students came from high schools that have similar workloads to MIT? 

&gt;It could be explicit like “why do we have so much homework for class XXX” or more indirect like “online classes make doing this courseload impossible” or “I can’t socialize at all because I’m forced to study all week”.

&gt;Show me a school with as woefully adequate living situations, intense schooling, and motivated students 

MIT, Caltech, Cornell, UC Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Johns Hopkins, etc. Now you show me a similarly ranked school with a strong STEM program that ***doesn't*** have an ""intense"" workload and competitive students. You might mention a place like Stanford, but that's the exception and not the norm. 

&gt;Gatekeeping a bunch of stressed, overworked Tech students doesn’t really help anyone.

It just never inflated them like so many schools have done over the past decade  thereby actually holding its students to standard.

I've followed SGA closely since I've come to Tech, and I really do think the work they do benefits students. I'm not going to list out every single action SGA has taken over the past 5 years to make this campus a better place, but I'd encourage you to look at this [current SGA's Fall 2020 Executive Review](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.gatech.edu/dist/9/988/files/2020/12/Fall-2020-Executive-Review.pdf)—a 34 page document that highlights the work *students* did in *one* semester.

Remember the over 15,000 PPE kits that were distributed across campus last semester? Uh, yeah, that was an SGA thing. Caleb Torres—the current Chief of Staff for SGA—among many others literally ran across this campus for weeks to give people masks and sanitizer. Have you ever used Course Critique? Uh, yeah, that's an SGA project. Have you ever enjoyed an event from any of the hundreds of on-campus Registered Student Organizations or perhaps participated in a club at Georgia Tech? Uh, yeah, SGA works with the Center for Student Engagement to fund literally every single one of those orgs. Did you like the fact that Georgia Tech had an early and election day voting/polling location at McCamish Pavilion (which served over 1,500 voters) that was fully staffed by students on election day? Yeah, that was SGA.

I hate how cynical this campus is at times. Yes, challenge the efficacy of SGA. Yes, challenge them to do better. Yes, call for an SGA that works for the students on this campus. But, please, also recognize the work they do and realize that SGA already does work for the students here. Be thankful that we have students who are working what effectively boils down to a full-time job *while also being students and human beings* just to try and make your life a little bit better.

 I'll be the first to admit that I really don't know much for details when it comes to the counselor that accompanies the mental health situations and I understand that GTPD isn't equipped to always handle the after hours stuff (nor do I really know when ""after-hours"" begins for a PD).

comments,"Hi Sam and Ajanta! I really appreciate the OSI reform, DRSO problem recognition, dining changes, and the GT/USG relationship discussion. I have a few questions after reading through the platform:

You use ""Hire"", ""Increase"", ""Expand"" and ""Create""  **52** times in your platform, the majority of which require funding (some on a huge scale). Where do you expect this money comes from?  Will you commit to NOT supporting an increase in student fees? If so, how do you plan on still achieving these goals?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***GPA MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOLARSHIPS WORSEN MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS***

Yes doing better in school is often correlated with lower mental health - but these scholarships have requirements to ensure the money is being spent on high-performing students. Changing this challenges the entire idea of using GPA as a metric for success. Which may very well be a valid argument but there's not a better solution at this point and GPA continues to measure knowledge to reasonable accuracy.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***Allocate more funds for cultural events***

Doubling down here on ""where is this money coming from?"". All it takes is a quick look at JacketPages to see how much money cultural orgs get. If anything, funding needs to be more scrutinized for these events as some of my favorite funded line items I've seen have been ""Camel Rental"" and ""fire breather"" (I'm not kidding). All the while there are engineering clubs who have to line item every nut/bolt/screw, sport clubs who can't get funding to go to nationals, and philanthropy clubs who can't get enough funding for trips, due to JFC policy. Its absurd that student money gets thrown into a big pile then redistributed through clubs. I don't need my student fees going to more Camel rentals :(

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;***Advocate for a low-cost bar with live music near Tech Square.***

Ok, sweet, who's funding this? Economics are going to dictate whether this is feasible and there's a reason there are no college bars near GT. Midtown is incredibly wealthy and it makes much more sense to capture that crowd than students. Its statements like these that, IMO really hurt a candidate's platform. This isn't something you can realistically start, its verbalizing a wishlist.

&gt;***Require asynchronous delivery option of all courses***

Absolutely no. I cannot vote for this ticket for this reason alone. Remote classes have destroyed this campus.

 There are so many things listed in your vision that I honestly can’t tell what’s actually important to this ticket which is a concern because there’s no way even 1/2 of the things mentioned there will get accomplished in a year due to lack of funding for some expensive projects/lack of institutional power to control a lot of different departments at Georgia Tech.",positive,0.9445,positive,0.09,03/07/2021

comments,"&gt;You use ""Hire"", ""Increase"", ""Expand"" and ""Create"" 52 times in your platform, the majority of which require funding (some on a huge scale). Where do you expect this money comes from? Will you commit to NOT supporting an increase in student fees? If so, how do you plan on still achieving these goals?

Many of these “expand” and “increase” points are about programs like STAR and public forums - creating programs to manage textbook donations or adding bringing back the “What is SGA” campaign to talk to different orgs about what we do, which would be changes that don’t require additional costs. Additionally a lot of “expands” come from the transition to in-house dining. This is a large cost that GT has already committed to taking on, we want to ensure that as that increase happens, good things like diverse cultural food options increase with it. We only say “hire” twice here, which involves some niche counselling services and those hires are determined by USG on a needs-basis. It should not come as a net cost to GT, it just depends upon (fingers-crossed) USG saying yes. Many of the “create” action items are in regards to new feedback forms and chat portals, online features like menu or career fair filters, and new advocacy committees and leadership positions. Right now SGA has a serious transparency problem and Admin are tough to reach for students outside the organization. We've got a set of programs to create and expand to fix that.

We commit to NOT supporting an increase in student fees. We commit to improving campus without increasing the financial burden on students. 

&gt;Yes doing better in school is often correlated with lower mental health - but these scholarships have requirements to ensure the money is being spent on high-performing students. Changing this challenges the entire idea of using GPA as a metric for success. 

​A part of this involves how Georgia Tech scholarships contrast with the Zell Miller/HOPE scholarship. Zell Miller/HOPE has a GPA buffer to account for the rigor of STEM classes and make sure students keep that scholarship. Mant GT-funded scholarships don’t have this, and students who have one bad semester can lose the scholarship for some time before earning it back, which compounds the mental health stressors put on students. These are still high-achieving brilliant students who we don’t want to spiral because a lack of grace pushed them in a bad direction.
&gt;Doubling down here on ""where is this money coming from?"". All it takes is a quick look at JacketPages to see how much money cultural orgs get.

This is one where the money is already there! SGA does not allocate funds perfectly equitably - a few orgs eat up a disproportionate amount of the budget while smaller, cultural orgs often don’t even know this funding is here. This action item is directed at addressing SGA’s issues with allocations in order to help make sure underfunded organizations are pointed in the right direction to get the funding they need.

&gt;Ok, sweet, who's funding this? Economics are going to dictate whether this is feasible and there's a reason there are no college bars near GT. Midtown is incredibly wealthy and it makes much more sense to capture that crowd than students. Its statements like these that, IMO really hurt a candidate's platform. This isn't something you can realistically start, its verbalizing a wishlist.

Right now there’s a massive Midtown infrastructure project called the [Midtown Stitch](https://www.atlantadowntown.com/initiatives/the-stitch) that Tech is planning for (it involves the destruction of O’Keefe, two greek houses, and an entire quad of dorms). We also have a decent level of say in this project and SGA members serve on its planning committees. The project has two main areas of expansion: green spaces/parks and arts/entertainment in Midtown. Since the project runs all the way over I-75/85 connector from North Ave to 10th Street, it’s going to totally reshape campus, with construction slated for 2026. This is not a short-term goal - we want to get in early, making sure that Tech voices the need for a bar that caters to students by being low-cost and near campus. We’re going to work with GT Campus Services as well to promote this project and we’ve had success working with them in the past on dining initiatives.

&gt;There has to be a standard somewhere and we cannot turn the university into one big Udemy course.

With this one we are not advocating for GT to stay a Zoom University, nor are we asking professors to teach entire courses online. We’re asking that all courses have the ability to be recorded in the event of a student missing class for illness, family emergency, or in the case of international students and students who haven’t been vaccinated who aren’t able to safely return to campus yet because of COVID-19. So again, to clarify: this asynchronous ability would be in addition to in-person delivery of classes instead of replacing in-person classes. It will not be perfect, just as this year has been so far from perfect. But it will help ensure students have some way to keep up to date in classes when things don’t go as planned. We are excited for the return to in-person classes, even if it means getting out of bed.

I’m glad you pointed out cost concerns in this platform - we really did write it trying to make realistic plans that wouldn’t require funding. The main areas that need new funding are key programs like counselling which we view as a necessity for GT. When it comes to programs at GT, as long as it’s not a $60 million building, the money is often there - it comes down to problems with our priorities and how we allocate funding. We’ve spoken to specific departments like GT Admissions and the Counseling Center about some of our proposed ideas, and overall they have the resources to make the projects happen.

comments,"Congratulations on being admitted to Georgia Tech! Here are some of my recommendations (mainly on-campus spots and stores)

If you’re planning to live on campus, I would suggest locating some of the dorms and taking note of their location relative to buildings you’ll have classes in. I’m sure there are maps available online, but I found checking out the location of dorms in-person to be much more beneficial than looking online, especially to see the area where you’ll be walking around at. Maybe spot the differences between East and West Campus. If you’re interested in any LLC’s, you could check out where there dorms are located (it may be a deciding factor on whether or not to join them).

Check out west village. They have options to pay with a credit card (no cash at the moment I think with coronavirus), so you can actually eat there if you want. Also take a look inside exhibition hall. They only have Panda Express and Twisted Taco there, I think. Near exhibition hall is Rising Roll, and they also accept credit cards so you could eat there (out of all places on campus, I recommend eating there).

Kroger off Howell Mill is pretty nice and would be a great place to get groceries during the week. Same think with Publix at Howell Mill. It’s a 5-10 min drive from West Campus and it’s removed from all the buildings and commotion in Atlanta.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask! Again, congrats on being accepted! Awesome achievement!",positive,0.9956,positive,0.24752791068580543,03/07/2021
comments,"I believe that recently, people feel more disconnected from the good things about Tech, and just as connected to the worst. 

Logging on to a bluejeans call and sitting inside doesn't have the same effect as walking through our beautiful campus on the first sunny day in a while, hanging out in the student center between classes, and going to fun scpc events. All the while the hardest challenges of Tech are still present, emphasized even more by the state of the country. Loneliness, course load, substance/alcohol abuse, and loneliness again. When Tech decides to have in-person classes and return to a normal and beneficial state of affairs, you'll hopefully see more positive attitudes (if not on this subreddit than IRL) akin to new growth after a forest fire. Having a support system through friends and clubs is vital, but **our** student and administrative leaders insist that meeting new people and sharing face-to-face experiences is significantly unsafe. 

The damage done by a lost year of adolescence and college can hardly be healed. What our society is doing right now has never been tried, and we continue to see bad results. it's like a fucked up lesson about game theory. Those who follow the precautions feel the bad effects of isolation (much much worse than coronavirus for our demographic, isolated on campus with almost all young healthy people) while still occasionally getting sick. Those who disobey orders don't feel a thing besides the risk they get sick, which they knowingly walk into.

Any number is tragic though, and there is a broad trend (not just at Tech) of increasing suicide rates among youth. Suicide is the 2nd highest cause of death among college students, behind accidents (broad category ranging from alcohol poisoning to car crashes). Just like you should be mindful of your physical environment and well-being to try to avoid accidents, you should recognize that this can be a difficult mental environment and take your mental health seriously.

\- Thanks for the explanation on where some of the cost burden lays.

\- Your platform aggressively states how bad GPA requirements are as a whole, but it looks like you aren't actually aiming at getting rid of them in any form. You're adding grace into the GPA timelines. Makes sense.

  
\- No idea where you can get the statement ""Cultural orgs often don’t even know this funding is here"" when some of the largest clubs with the largest expenditures are cultural orgs, and have been so for quite some time. I'm sure there are some that don't know there is funding available - but then overall goal should not be to give more money to cultural orgs'. It should be to make sure all student orgs know about funding. Singling out cultural orgs is a way to sound ""dIvErSe"" and pander to the largest groups on campus when the problem is really just education of orgs in general.

\- ""The Stitch"" that you keep linking is a project focused on the downtown connector area and does not reach to GT. You actually seem to be referencing the [Midtown Connector](https://cdn.atlantaregional.org/wp-content/uploads/arc-taqc-mcp-presentation-02102021-final.pdf), a related but separate project. Both are in the concept stages. The Midtown Connector is also a total pipe dream at a cost of \~$1B. Using this concept to say you're going to advocate for a student bar is just insane and a waste of time.

\- A class that allows both in-person and remote students is not equitable, not fair, and lowers the quality of learning. Most professors will not want to do that, because they know their teaching ability is affected (a prof I had quit teaching both because he said it was impossible to do correctly). Is it equitable to the people who may not be back yet? Sure. At the expense of lowering the quality of education for literally everyone else?

Being a smaller campus than a lot of other universities (not that I don't like it, the campus is amazing), I don't like the fact that food is only available at one concentrated place in the entire campus, even so, without much choice. Each time I have gone to get mental health help, I had always been turned away saying there are not enough professionals to see me because it is a busy time of the semester? Having said that, stamps is awesome though. They have very caring doctors and NPs and a lot of my deficiencies which I didn't even know existed, came to light because of them. 

Maybe all this is to do with the fact that our university is right in the middle of a city. Since, people can rely on the city to provide to you, the university as such has become insufficient over time. 

I even feel that most of the professors do not care if your learning process is an interesting and intriguing one. I am still waiting to take a class where I feel like- wow this professor is amazing.

comments,"Overall it's a well-written platform with a lot of good intention - props to you for that. However upon looking more closely, a number of concerning points come about. Much like other commenters have mentioned, your platform calls for numerous changes most of which require funding and yet no concrete plan for that is given. There are also several actions that are already being done, some of which have been in place for quite some time. It seems that not enough research was done on all aspects of the platform, which leads to questioning whether similar missteps may be taken in your term of office.

&gt;Action: Expand the GT Library’s Laptop Kiosk to allow students to rent laptops out on a semesterly basis

What's the end goal here? What problem does this solve? Who would fund this, including both the hardware and the labor to manage the additional overhead?

&gt;Action: Provide student subscriptions through Georgia Tech for the New York Times, Washington Post, the Economist, and more resources

Free NYT subscription is [already a thing](https://nytimesineducation.com/access-nyt/georgia-institute-of-technology-atlanta-ga/).

&gt;Action: Include wheelchair and scooter accessible buses in new bus fleet  
Action: Ensure that the new housing master plan includes elevators in residence halls and takes into account the needs of students with disabilities

Would both of these not already be mandated by ADA?

&gt;Action: Use the infrastructure from Tech Support’s live chat to create a chat feature for Housing and Maintenance requests so students can send messages regarding unresolved or emergency requests &amp; get a timely response

Given that Housing is known to be slow to respond to maintenance requests and emails and may not always answer the phone either, what leads you to believe  that yet another means of communication would be adopted and properly utilized?

&gt;Action: Expand Stingerette program’s scope so students who live off-campus can get safe rides back.  
Action: If Lyft partnership doesn’t work out because of GT Legal, we would work to expand Stingerette program so they run during the day as well

Increases to the scope of Stingerette service would likely require more drivers, more vehicles, and potentially have insurance implications as well for expanding operating areas. All of those would require funding - from where?

&gt;Action: Partner with campus research programs to develop in-house software and algorithms to optimize Stingerette operations  

What specific aspects of operations do you suggest need optimizing?

&gt;Action: Eliminate ticketing on non-event weekends

This would remove a revenue source which goes against your suggestion of other changes to PTS operations which would require additional funding.

&gt;Action: Expand variety of parking pass options. One option can be semesterly, one option can be one-time use for classes, etc.

PTS has made [a number of improvements](https://pts.gatech.edu/permits-payment) in this area because of COVID. They already have permit options for per-semester, ""Flex"" permits usable in 11 parking areas daily/weekly/monthly, and SmartPark in 3 parking areas paid per-use. Is there something that these do not cover that you see a need for?

&gt;Action: Create a bus route to the airport during times when many students are arriving/leaving campus

What's the goal here? Rather than adding more vehicles to already congested traffic, perhaps encourage utilization of the Trolley (or the _Gold Route_ as they're calling it now?) to take MARTA to the airport and vice/versa? I recognize that may not be feasible for everyone with luggage and whatnot but I really cannot understand logic behind a bus route to the airport when other more efficient options already exist.

&gt;Action: Replace campus lights that go out with LED lights to promote a more energy-efficient campus

Is GT Facilities not already doing this?

&gt;Action: Raise the temperature set point by 1 degree in campus buildings to promote more energy efficiency in our heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems

Have you had a conversation with Facilities about what actions they're already doing to improve energy efficiency to see whether or not this would be beneficial?

&gt;Action: Encourage RSOs and other departments to cut down on swag and giveaways they hand out

What alternatives would you support to assist in promoting organizations and engaging students? People love free stuff.

&gt;Action: Make recycling bins available to students to live off-campus and who may not otherwise have recycling bins near them or in their place of residence

How would this work operationally? Why is this GT's problem to solve?

&gt;Action: Establish a contract with Adobe so enrolled GT students can more easily access programs like Photoshop, Lightroom, &amp; Illustrator

Where would funding for this come from? Licensing for all students would be extremely expensive.

&gt;Background: In the past year and a half, most campus organizations froze operations while their leaders graduated

Do you have any quantitative/qualitative evidence to support this claim? This sounds like a broad generalization extrapolated from a small number of orgs that may have had unusual circumstances.

&gt;Action: Advocate for Spring 2021 graduates to receive the vaccine

comments,"It's still a work in progress! They recently hired a new executive chef to spearhead the self-operated dining program menus. Apparently the way it works is that the executive chef will come up with recipes based upon concepts posed by GT or independently. Those recipes will eventually be a part of the menus, but they're still in development right now.

If you have any specific things or concepts you would like to see, the person in charge of all the dining stuff is Ryan Greene ([*ryan*.*greene*@*gatech*.edu](mailto:ryan.greene@gatech.edu)). They're using the data they collected from a dining survey earlier this semester to drive a lot of the decisions, but there's still plenty of time to voice thoughts/opinions. SGA &amp; RHA also have a weekly open meeting with the VP of Campus Services, which you can sign up for here: [https://www.sga.gatech.edu/undergrad-exec/campus-services/advisory-board-meetings/](https://www.sga.gatech.edu/undergrad-exec/campus-services/advisory-board-meetings/)

Those are usually a bit more broad since they can be dining, PTS, housing, or anything campus services-related, but it's always an option as well. If you can't make it to those meetings but want a specific topic brought up, I'd be happy to do so since I'm in them anyway!

comments,"&gt;Rather than adding more vehicles to already congested traffic, perhaps encourage utilization of the Trolley (or the Gold Route as they're calling it now?) to take MARTA to the airport and vice/versa?

I was going to mention this earlier. Airport connection is one of the few things MARTA does rather well with existing infrastructure, so I really don't see why we shouldn't just be encouraging its use over a whole new bus route.

Luggage can be a hassle, but I'd argue that a large train is better equipped for that *at scale* compared to a (relatively) small bus. Getting the luggage in/out of Midtown station is the only real pain point.

If there isn't much demand for a bus at a given time, you're wasting a lot of resources to run the bus all the way to the airport for just one person. By contrast, the trains are already running anyway, so there's no added inefficiency resulting from (non-)use by students. Unlike buses, during peak usage, a train keeps going and thus transporting *some people* efficiently, while buses sit in standstill traffic and stop working entirely for *everyone*.

I know trains aren't super popular in the US (and they may not always be the best solution), but for airport transportation they're great. The aversion to rail is especially funny here considering that everyone uses the much-adored Plane Train once they're airside.",negative,-0.2589,positive,0.27411014911014914,03/07/2021

comments,"Hey everyone- this is Jackson Caruso, SGA’s VP of Academic Affairs and one of the student representatives on the Student Regulations Committee that was part of the decision to eliminate spring break.

As students and as a committee, we were forced to consider a lot of unknowns balancing public health and mental health. We didn’t know how the pandemic would look in a month, much less well into March.

The truth is that many faculty members pushed to end a week earlier in the semester, bypassing spring break and offering no rest days. Students pushed back and offered a compromise of three rest days. We ended up with two rest days. In my opinion, that’s better than zero.

Georgia Tech’s own researchers and scientists recommended a delayed start to the semester to reduce Covid-19 transmission as a result of holiday-related travel. Adding a Spring Break at this point would result in the semester being extended past May 6th, which would pose logistical challenges for students, families, friends, and plans post-Spring.

We see that many universities in the country made a similar decision and are sticking to it, with some exceptions. I respect that many of you are frustrated by this decision, and please know that I have and will continue to advocate for the Georgia Tech community we love and care about, always putting students first.

My best advice is don't be intimidated because most students feel the same way they just aren't as open about it as others.

If the effects of this virus have shown us anything, it's that society is more than capable of making the appropriate accommodations when it wants to.   
There are many questions to be answered GT:  
What accommodations will there be for those who cannot/do not feel comfortable returning to campus?  
To what extent will safety regulations be enforced on campus?  
How will the institution continue to leverage the benefits of virtual classroom environments?

Maybe it's telling students that they'll grade homework lighter, so don't worry about making mistakes, or maybe the professor chops off a few homework problems a week and takes some time to record the solutions to it so the students can see how it works.

About 2 weeks ago I felt similarly exhausted just from being isolated since the start of the semester (being in the same dorm repeating the same day over and over again, doing a lot of work, not talking to people). I decided to go back home and take a break and somehow make that work with my schedule. I’ve been feeling a lot better and more relaxed, partly because now I’m making it a routine to go back home at least every other weekend. It gives me something to look forward to! I don’t know if you have the ability to go back home, but if you can I really suggest that you do. It gives you literally the freedom to walk around and talk to people. Again, I’m not sure if you are able to do this, but if you can I would recommend it!

If you can’t go back home, I hope you can find something to do to break up the similarity of everyday. I have found that even driving feels rewarding because I can leave my dorm and get into a different environment. What’s your favorite store? Over the weekend, maybe you can give away 2hrs and visit it. 

If you’ve only been to the Culc and your dorm this semester, it would be extremely healthy to find some place to go away from campus and do something enjoyable.

1. You came to GT, now welcome to hell. Most universities may let you take it easy, but I'm assuming you came to GT to get a more substantial education, and well... I'm not really sure what you expected. GT is a brutal environment that is probably harder than most jobs in a sense. You work on hard things, and often. That's the point of coming here. You learn skills and develop a work ethic unlike any other place. If you transfer in here, it's probably an even bigger shock because you didn't know what to expect before coming in from highschool, but now you feel that you do because you've been in college now. GT is going to eat your life for a while except it.
2. Finding friends... Finding friends... Yeah, not gonna lie, not exactly easy to do. People are depressed, bogged down in work, and have a hard time finding the time to do their own work, let alone hang out with others. I think you're being a little bit harsh on the students here, when you should really be directing more of your anger towards the school in those cases. I'm always down to make new friends though if you're up for it, we can do something sometime. I have a bit more free time now than when I first came here.
3. What now? First of all, there is no time. So the real trick is learning how to make time. In the past, you just had free time, now you have to grind for it if you want any of it. Sad, but that's just how it is. Your first semester will probably not be great. You're not used to the workload or the environment, so expect some growing pains while you get used to things, especially now.

Presently, only certain members of our community are eligible under the guidelines established by the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH). We're hopeful that the state will soon further expand the eligible population to include higher education faculty and staff. We've been ready and stand ready to start vaccinating the broader Tech population.  Until then, though, only the following are eligible:

* Educators and staff for Pre-K, K-12, Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL) licensed or exempt childcare programs.
* Adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their caregivers.
   * An intellectual disability is a disability characterized by significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior, which covers many everyday social and practical skills. This disability originates before the age of 22.
   * A developmental disability is a physical or mental impairment that happens before the age of 22, is expected to last a lifetime, and affects at least three activities of daily living.       Activities of daily living include self-care, receptive and expressive language, learning, mobility, self-direction, capacity for independent living, and economic self-sufficiency.
* Parents of children with complex medical conditions who are at high risk for Covid-19 complications.
   * Malignancies requiring active treatment
   * Immunocompromised state (weakened immune system) including organ transplant (bone marrow or solid organ) within two years
   * Critical congenital heart disease
   * Asthma (moderate to severe)
   * Sickle cell disease
   * Diabetes
   * Obesity (BMI &gt;95%)
   * Cystic fibrosis
   * Significant neurologic injury or condition (e.g. hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, traumatic brain injury, congenital anomaly, acute flaccid myelitis) with functional/developmental impairment (e.g. cerebral palsy, developmental disability, prematurity, mitochondrial disease)
   * Technology dependence (e.g. BiPAP, trach)

There are a lot of ways to get involved in SGA. I would say that the most approachable is to find an issue/topic on campus that interests you and join the committee in SGA that works in that area. Joining this is easy, there are no elections and we love to get new people. 

You could also join UHR (Undergraduate House of Reps). The deadline to run for a seat has already passed, but we usually have a few seats to fill in the Fall as well. Come by our meetings 7:30pm Tuesdays on BlueJeans! 

I’m not as knowledgeable on the Judiciary branch, but they do great stuff for students as well. They look at student code of conduct cases mostly.

comments," There are a lot of ways to get involved, at least in Undergraduate SGA! 

Undergrad SGA is split into three branches - executive, legislative, and judicial. 

The executive branch is comprised of the President, Executive Vice President, cabinet, and committees. The President and EVP are voted on by the entire student body in spring (elections are currently ongoing). Once they are chosen, applications will open for cabinet positions. The cabinet positions/responsibilities are listed here: [https://www.sga.gatech.edu/undergrad-exec/](https://www.sga.gatech.edu/undergrad-exec/). The President and EVP conduct interview and appoint cabinet members based on who they think is the best fit for each position.

All executive committees have a committee chair, which are usually chosen via application and appointment process by the newly-appointed cabinet member which oversees that committee. For example, the VP of Campus Services usually appoints the Dining Committee Chair because the Dining Committee is under their purview. Pretty much anyone can join any committee as a general member. The full list of committees and their descriptions can be found here: [https://www.sga.gatech.edu/undergrad-exec/executive-committees/](https://www.sga.gatech.edu/undergrad-exec/executive-committees/). Some are more outward-facing than others. E.g. the Housing Committee works closely with administrators doing advocacy while something like Internal Tools is more SGA and project-oriented. 

The legislative branch is comprised of the Undergraduate House of Representatives. This is a group of students who run for elected office in the spring (with the exception of 4 freshman representatives who run in the fall and Member-at-Large, which is elected by UHR) and are chosen by constituents of the position for which they are running. For example, the Sophomore Class Representative for next year will be voted on by people who will be sophomores next year (current freshmen). There are a lot of positions - class representatives (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior), Academic Representatives (these represent different majors across campus, with anywhere from 1-4 reps depending on the size of that major), Athletics Rep, International Student Reps, Co-Op Student Rep, Transfer Student Reps, and Members-at-Large. UHR used to primarily focus on Student Activity Fee allocation, but no longer does that. They’re working on figuring out how to restructure effectively, but this year it’s mostly been about passing resolutions. UHR members are required to be on at least one committee, so there’s a lot of overlap with the executive branch. 

The judicial branch is the one I’m least familiar with, so I can’t give too much insight. They primarily deal with Office of Student Integrity cases- if a student chooses to have their case heard before a student panel, the Undergraduate Judiciary Committee (UJC) is who it will go to. I believe UJC Justices are selected based on recommendations of the current UJC Justices. The judicial branch also includes the Elections Committee.

For incoming freshmen, FreShGA and running for freshman class representative are two ways to get into SGA quickly. FreShGA is the freshman leadership committee of SGA. During fall semester (non-COVID) they usually focus on planning The Final Stand, which is an on-campus event that takes place right before finals. Spring semester they choose an advocacy project to focus on. Freshman representative works pretty much the same as all other elected representative positions except elections happen in the fall instead of the spring.

For older students hoping to get involved, I highly recommend you apply to be a committee chair or join an executive committee when applications come out in a month or two if you’re interested in the executive branch. Elections are currently happening for the legislative branch, but there are always some seats left unfilled. To fill these, they will have an application process to apply for these positions either later this year or early next year. It is an extremely simple process to go through, and I heard back very quickly when I did this. I’m not as sure with UJC, but if you’re interested in that I can ask the Chief Justice for more info!",positive,0.9896,positive,0.10893722943722944,03/09/2021

II. If we had them, they would be tags, but we don't, so you can't.

III. Most people don't like venting into the void. They want to feel heard, vindicated, and helped.

IV. I'm happy to be here and learn, I'm not happy to have to deal with the bullshit that comes  with it. If you're going to fuck me with some bullshit, at least have the courtesy to use lube, it's only polite. No I don't want to pay for your overpriced food just to live in the dorms. If I have to take a class, don't be an ass. PTS shouldn't function like a broken clock. If you're going to bring attention to mental health, have a functioning solution, not some signs. And I could go on, but you get the point. Nice education, not so nice student services.

V. Anger is very clickable. Happy things are fine, but angry and provocing things make you click on them. And... come on, you're not gonna down vote someone when they've been dropped on their ass and kicked in the teeth. Especially when you've had it happen to you before.

VI. The site isn't the problem, though it's not great to have a circlejerk about things that make you miserable. Pity parties don't usually help in the long run unfortunately. The real problem is that constantly getting drop kicked by the school you pay a good chunk of change to go to hurts like a motherfucker. You don't want to wake in the morning knowing that, ""Oh yeah, my life is about to be hell again. Well, time to bend over."" If you're going to deal with that shit, you need good mental health and the tools to deal with problems that come your way. I'm pretty sure most people in their late teens to early twenties aren't really equipped for that, especially when most of them were probably top of their class, if not salutation or valedictorian who haven't been fucked like they are now. You're probably right when you say that this place doesn't help, but it's also not the main issue.

Firstly, there could be a litany of reasons they’re no longer interested in working with you. Less than half the work in a startup in building the devices.

But if the team isn’t cohesive, there’s no reason to fight to be on it. The company will just fail. 

As far as what you can do to protect your IP, if it is truly novel and worthy of a patent and you’ve done a preliminary patent search, spend the time and the ~$100 to file a provisional. This will at the minimum put the prior art out to prevent yourself from being excluded from the technology. It will also give you a priority date that will make their patent application near worthless. 

Your best recourse at this point will be to try to convince them to jointly present at Inventure and split any winnings 3 ways, and in exchange you will assign any IP to them. At which point immediately after Inventure you can go your separate ways. 

Take this as an lesson in not turning over your IP to someone without cash or legal documents to protect yourself. There’s no guarantee that they will win inventure prize anyways.",positive,0.9748,positive,0.09523809523809523,03/10/2021

comments,"I actually have less issue with the phrase “cheer the brave and bold” than I do with the way the lyrics seem to purposely show contrast between the daughter and son. The daughter is the object of the sentence rather than the subject (I’d put her on the campus vs she’d go to the campus - I know it doesn’t have the right ring to it but you get the point) implying that she can not do things for herself whereas the the son is the subject of the sentence (he’d say to HELL with georgia). And then aside from that there’s “but if I had a son” rather than “and if I had a son” which further suggests contrast.

I know it’s just a song that has been around a long time and am not suggesting that such significant changes should actually be made to the lyrics, but it is good to be aware of these sorts of linguistic subtleties that can promote misogyny. The way I see it, unofficially replacing the “cheer for the brave and bold” lyric is a nice nod to the fact that some of the lyrics are problematic and the student body recognizes it.",positive,0.802,positive,0.22512531328320803,03/10/2021

Yes, Chapter is 1+ hour a week, but in my sorority that gets you zero points and isn't even the bare minimum that you have to do. You have to earn CPC as well as Chapter points, do service hours, etc. I have also noticed that a lot of my sorority sisters are really immature and will try to use you for answers, especially if they see you doing particularly well in class. If you do join a sorority, just know that what they put on during rush is nothing about what it actually is. If you are serious about your studies, be prepared to be tempted with drugs and alcohol and even to sleep with guys. It's also incredibly expensive 200-400 dollars a month plus chapter fees and any accessories you want to buy. I would not recommend joining for support, because you'll be getting pressured and get fake friends unless you are the one to use people. There is also a lot of rules that you have to follow and they'll constantly be nagging you about them.

If you have a mindset for construction you could switch to civil - some hard classes but we are also the joke of engineering so take that what you will. Focus on what you like about life/passions and reach out to any good professors you have taken. Before I transferred here I had many conversations with professors about switching from CE to something else and they helped me talk through decisions and my future. It's important to be able to talk about this aloud rather than internalize it. If your parents help reach out to them or old HS teachers. Anyone you connected well with in life is going to want you to succeed and do well in life. It is incredibly hard and I was all about ready to change my major before I had an internship guaranteed and my dad told me it would be dumb to change and not try it. Hands down the best information I have been told. If you really feel lost take a semester off - keep in mind you have this summer and can come to a realization and completely change your classes the first week of school. Sure that is stressful but it is a pretty good situation considering the circumstances. I really hope it works out for you. Life is too difficult not to talk out your options and constantly reevaluate the trajectory of your career path.

Referring to your story, my motive for choosing architecture was partially due to money tbh. I don't see any fault in that but I came to realization that this major is purely reflected on your passion and love for this major. Throughout highschool, I gained an indirect pressure that I needed to make a lot of money so I can be happy in life and support my parents as they grow older. However, I realized architecture will probably not get me far in life as I feel unhappy with it and cant see myself doing well.

I realized that for the past year at this school that I never enjoyed learning and doing the projects and it literally led me to feeling emotionally and physically unstable trying to keep up with unofficial due dates and always feeling left behind and clueless. Someone told me the other day that if I don't like the major, that not liking it is a justified reason to switch. I was thinking of taking this spring semester off and tbh I still feel the same way.

I considered myself to be good at math and I love designing and drawing when I was young. I guess playing creative minecraft was a big thing for me and I would always spend countless hours on it. Money was also a big role in my decision. As I grew older, I stopped being creative as I used to be and focused on getting good grades and tried to live life normally. Idk why but I was set on making my goal to become an architect major at Georgia Tech since middle school. Throughout highschool, I did absolutely nothing to further my understanding of architecture. I guess seeing how intense this program is and how time consuming led me to hate it. People told me that architecture is about feeling the satisfaction of finishing a project, but I don't feel that at all. I feel exhausted and relieved that everything is over even if I didn't do a good job on it. I was glad of receiving a B on my projects, which led me to realizing too late that my gpa was dropping.

Yeah I really don't like it much at all. Like you I am good (enough) at math and whatnot so I make it through but my internship was in construction management (In construction there are three paths to follow (in no order) 1) Project management - office side (focuses more on the financial/documents making sure the project runs smoothly, 2) Superintendent - field side running the project and subcontractors plumbing, electrical, gas etc. making sure the physical project is on schedule 3) planning and estimating - preproject stuff, works with the owner/architect to develop a timeline and secure 'bids' (contracts) with the main necessary subcontractors (steel erection, site development, etc.). You may like that actually every General Contractor is different and there are different business models but some do 'design bid build' which does more on the architecture side of things I suppose. I have a ppt on the business structures form a course if that may help.

My family comes from business and no engineering whatsoever. My dad told me about civil engineering and it kinda stuck until I struggled in statics (yes statics 2000 level) which made me want to switch cause I didn't care for it. Thank God I landed an internship and did that because it changed my perspective from Civil to Construction which imo is just more fun.

You can google more or reach out to me via pm I don't mind helping you out and telling you more. I was able to stick with CE because although the engineering classes are difficult for me at times I am able to visualize what I am solving for: beam bending, shearing of metals etc.",positive,0.8703,positive,0.25416666666666665,03/10/2021
comments,"Really the long-term solution is making public college permanently tuition free. With college becoming more and more of a necessity for people looking to obtain a comfortable standard of living in the US, combined with education being one of the primary factors in bringing struggling families out of poverty, we agree that there's no reason anybody should rack up hundreds of thousands in student loan debt just to see that reality. A measure like that would take months if not years of congressional procedure while requiring more in government spending, however, whereas the Biden administration can trivially cancel student debt as it stands right now but chooses not to. We support anything that provides relief to the working class, and right now the most immediate way to do that for students is to forgive our outstanding debt.",positive,0.8071,positive,0.3515306122448979,03/10/2021

However, VIP's could also open a path into AI research and might be a but more attainable and beginner friendly (depends on the group).

The first time led to me eventually overcoming my depression about breaking up with my high school gf. 

Another time led to me changing majors so that I’m studying a subject that I truly want to study and also be around people that make me feel good about who I am. 

Finally, my last depressive episode led me to find the motivation to finish strong in Fall 2020 and come ever so closer to graduating from this school. 

I shouldn’t have necessarily spoken about myself as much. I simply wanted to share my story because I am also constantly battling depression and I feel that somewhere in the words I just type is a nugget that could help you.

When Tech implemented the OMSCS it was truly ground-breaking, but now we're up to four(?) fully-online masters. Because of this experience as well as GTPE's expertise in online learning we were really well-prepared to go online (seriously, as bad as we have it we're better off than most). We also have programs like SOUP that add to this.

Most people I know, not necessarily everyone, but most people have depression, anxiety, etc.  Now, that may only partly be due to Tech, but it's a factor.  Suicide is not uncommon here, especially this semester I believe we've already had a couple incidents.  Of course, you can manage your stress and experience by taking fewer credits, pacing yourself, and going in by acknowledging that getting a B or C is not the end of the world.  

I'm sure I'll get downvoted for this, but I don't really like Tech or the culture here, I am pretty happy-go-lucky and I find it depressing.  It's very competitive, the people can be a little anti-social, and I have to admit feeling stifled here sometimes, especially compared to my experience at other universities.  Sorry it's negative, I just wanted to add my perspective, but there are plenty of people who like it here.  And you can still make whatever you want out of your experience by joining clubs, pacing yourself, and putting yourself out there.

comments,"The technology is still evolving. Our online MS in CS program is a world leader in how to do this well.  I expect post-pandemic that there will be more online class offerings.

A few things are tricky. Making a well-designed online class like our OMSCS ones is a TON of work.  All my friends who have done one basically take a semester and work on only that.  And then a lot of the content is locked into little videos that are not so easy to update.... So it's certainly better for something we need to update less often.

Happy vision for the future: we get really good at figuring out which classes can comfortably be done well online, and as a result are able to offer a high quality learning experience to more people.  

Scary vision for the future: we (as a society, not just GT) do a crappy job of designing online learning experiences, but they replace face-to-face ones anyway.  As time goes on, having interaction with a human teacher increasingly is only for the privileged, and everyone else suffers with canned videos and auto-graders....

comments,"That's actually part of the topic of our [forthcoming book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/distributed)—how to leverage more of what we're already doing on campus to allow more remote options. /u/asbruckman is right: OMSCS courses require a massive amount of work, and OMSCS itself represents an extreme end of the spectrum. Can't commit to coming to class at 10AM MWF in KACB? You can instead take a class remotely, asynchronously, etc. on your own time.

But those are extreme ends of the spectrum. What if you can commit to attending at 10AM, but not in Atlanta? What if you can commit to attending in Atlanta, but after hours rather than during work hours—and what if there are 15 other students who can similarly commit to that? What if you need to leave campus for a month—too long to just miss a couple meetings and still complete the course, but not long enough to really need to skip the entire semester? Options already exist for distance learning, evening classes, etc., but they're usually segmented out into entirely separate offerings... but technology is at a place right now where we could add cohorts like that onto existing classes. 

That's exactly what I'm hoping to see more of going forward: not just the huge heavy OMSCS productions (though those still have their place), but regular courses that have policies that are more accommodating of students who can't commit to synchronous co-located attendance three times a week for four months; that can let those students attend, complete assessments, earn credit, and progress toward a degree without sacrificing things like human feedback, social interaction, and authentic projects; and that proactively try to form local cohorts of students who are away from campus like our cohorts at GT-Shenzhen that add their own synchronous co-located activities onto the remote asynchronous experience because they have a critical mass of local students. That's where I think we can make much more progress toward broader access without sacrificing the existing experience: we can accommodate students with work obligations, family obligations, health obstacles, and all sorts of other structural hurdles to typical attendance. And if we're no longer bound by the four walls and number of chairs, we can give anyone with a chance to succeed a try instead of limiting the opportunity to only the top X% of applicants.

I think we know this is all possible, technologically and administratively—OMSCS, for instance, has reached 11,000 students while the plurality of the curriculum remains project-based (40%, while exams are 25%) and the overwhelming majority of students' grades (75%) are generated by hand by instructors and TAs rather than by exclusively autograding (and none by pure peer grading at all). I think we're at a point where we (as higher education in general, not just Georgia Tech specifically) need only to commit to moving in that direction.",positive,0.9713,positive,0.1224454365079365,03/11/2021

I wrote in my schedule that I had the exam Next Tuesday, from what I believe I saw in an earlier lecture(turns out this was never actually said, and just a mental mistake on my part). Next Tuesday is a break day and the exam was today, and this was notified in a later lecture(which I haven't watched) and on the class website(which I didn't check). In addition the class uses Teams, so the actual ""Exam"" assignment was not posted on canvas until like 11 AM today, at which time I was working on my statics HW. I'm talking with the professor tmrw, hopefully things go well. But even if not I'll proceed with what I deserve and learn from this mistake.

The school has gotten much better at focusing on students mental health than they used to be, there are better living options around campus (although some are very expensive) and while he didn't do everything perfectly, student retention really improved under the last President. The best advice I give to every GT first year I meet is to find an outlet other than academics to help you relax, without being distracted. There are a ton of clubs on campus and having a support system of friends is key. It's a hard school, no doubt, but it's worth it.",positive,0.9927,positive,0.16925133689839572,03/12/2021

comments,"I am a graduate student and I guess I would say that I am happy I did not attend here for undergrad but love it for grad school. The reasons are as follows:

1. Tech is intense and because it is so focused on engineering there is no escape from the super intense focused culture that you might get at another university that had a more diverse set of majors and student population 
2. There are limited classes to take outside of engineering( when I was being admitted to undergrad I didn't care about this but came to care about it later.) this is important for two reasons 1) is that it is sometimes nice to take an easy course in outside your major the university that I went to for undergrad gave me a lot of options of random cool courses to take 2) most people I know who were super focused and didn't take many courses outside of engineering in undergrad at some point in their mid-twenties look up and begin to wonder if they chose the right field. This seems to be mitigated by taking courses outside your chosen major(and not just in other engineering disciplines) simply because you have done the exploration to be able to say yeah I tried that it was or wasn't for me. 
3. If you have any aspirations of going to grad school apparently tech has pretty low undergrad GPAs in comparison to other universities. This can hurt your chances of being admitted and getting funding. Unfortunately, other universities don't care about how ""hard"" tech is. They all think they are hard and will not acknowledge that another university may be harder or hand out lower grades. 

All of this isn't to say that Tech isn't a great place. It is and I am super happy to be here for graduate school but just be careful in weighting your options.",positive,0.9935,positive,0.1892374517374517,03/12/2021

I got accepted in 2018 but didn't have to do the summer semester. In hindsight, I kinda wish I had.

Go to office hours as much as possible. Even if you don't think you'll benefit or the thought scares you, go anyways.

Ask questions. No question is a stupid one. Use Piazza (our question board), emails, tutoring, whatever route you deem fit.

Do not let yourself fall behind in the material. Keep your head up, get some fresh air, and keep grinding. You'll get the hang of it, but do not cram.

You're gonna do great. The best way to succeed is here is staying positive and just keeping after it. Don't fall into the trap of ""what if I fail?"".

comments,"""Not the ending I was hoping for, but I'm still proud of this team.
Next year we rise
GO JACKETS!!!!!!!"" - Me, circa 2017.

A year in which we made it all the way to the NIT Championship left me legitimately excited for the future of Georgia Tech Basketball under Josh Pastner.  After that, I eagerly awaited with anticipation as he would get the pieces and develop them.  Starting with Jose Alvarado, who quickly asserted himself as an elite guard and the future leader on a squad that retained a lot of talent from that NIT squad.  

Four years later, we have indeed risen.  Even though the AD told Pastner not to expect to have a competitive team for a while, it didn't matter.  You can't deny the way he brought the talent together and molded them into a resilient, gutsy, scrappy, high energy squad that isn't afraid to go up against anyone.  Whether that's a ranked team with elite size and shooting ability like FSU or a blue-blood program with a history of excellence like Duke, this team hung with some giants.  They have throughout this period of time, and now there are more giants to face as we head to March Madness.

That first year of basketball with Josh Pastner wasn't lightning in a bottle; it was foreshadowing.  And now it has come to fruition.  Now we stand at the top of the ACC mountain.  And we aren't stopping there.  There is still work to be done.  This team could surprise people and potentially make a deep run in the tournament.  The stories of Pastner's first core Seniors, Jose Alvarado and Moses Wright, isn't finished yet.  It's time to continue the next chapter.

Josh Pastner wasn't expected to find success for the first few years of his tenure.  But as a wise man who practiced a martial art I also trained in....

comments,"Well I did it over this past summer when it was online, so your experience may be different than mine. The benefit of it is that you get a lot of advice about how to get involved in research and what that may look like. I really wouldn’t go in with the expectation of doing any cool research, unfortunately. We were assigned to create a slideshow and present our findings on a topic, and it was supposed to try and provide some kind of insight. It honestly felt like a high school presentation assignment, nothing to special. I think the tracks for the summer program aren’t as important as they seem. Yah you get some good advice sometimes, but it’s nothing spectacular, and I wouldn’t expect anything eye opening from it. I mean honestly, if you want to get involved in research, I found success in just reaching out to professors who researched topics that interested me and asking if I could help. That said, the summer program was totally worth it since it’s an easy way to get some common core credits out of the way, giving you more freedom to pursue more interesting classes during the year. It’s also a lighter load so it’s a lot less stressful than normal semesters. But yeah, I think they give themselves too much pride in the idea of the different “tracks”. If you have any more specific question just shoot a reply and I’d be happy to elaborate on my experience, but I did do it online so it may be different if you are going to do it in person.",positive,0.9951,positive,0.24910342261904764,03/14/2021

comments,"I was a summer admit.  This was under the quarter system so I was given the option of either summer or winter.  Tech was my #1 choice so I started during the summer.  I ended up having a blast.   Light academic load, smaller incoming freshman class to bond/befriend/hook up with + warm weather.... which for us meant trips (both organized by housing or set up with friends) to whitewater, stone mountain and many weekends out skating, bicycling, and  rafting.

I still got to come home after summer quarter ended to hang out with high school buddies as they were preparing to go off to college.   Cherry on top was already having a social network by time the rest of the freshmen started in fall and being able to introduce new acquaintances to existing friends.

Very few reasons not to do it unless you have a summer blowout(or extensive travel) already planned, but in many cases your high school friends could bring the festivities to you by visiting for a long weekend.

The main disadvantage for our incoming class was the AC in our dorm effectively being broken for much of a hot, GA summer, but it was small potatoes compared to being free enough to make my own decisions.

comments,"You don't need much coding experience, although it definitely can help. Basically, just code whatever you think is interesting in whatever language, and that practice will hopefully help later. 

The intro class CS 1301 is in Python, but since you took AP CS, you will probably take CS 1331 (which is in Java and builds off of some stuff from AP CS). [There's an old course website from a couple years ago](https://cs1331.gitlab.io/syllabus.html) which still has old homeworks, but it's kind of hard to follow along without the class, plus the class has changed a bit I've heard. 
Then CS 1332 is also in Java. And that's pretty much it for first year -- unless you take Modern Physics, which has some intro-level (but fun) Python [very similar to this tutorial series](https://rhettallain_gmail_com.trinket.io/numerical-calculations-in-physics#/numerical-calculation-tutorials/introduction-and-vectors).",positive,0.8594,positive,0.17202380952380952,03/15/2021
comments,"CS 1301 (the class AP CS A counts for) is taught in Python and starts from the basics (it’s the first CS class). CS 1331, CS 1332, and CS 2340 use Java. 

CS 1331 is really similar to AP CS A but with a few more topics like JavaFX. CS 1332 is less focused on Java features and more on working with different data structures. CS 2340 involves making a game in Java (we used JavaFX, but it depends on when you take the course), but the focus is more on software design principles, not on the language. 

Beyond those introductory courses, CS 2110 teaches you assembly and C, while CS 2200 builds off of that and doesn’t really teach you a new language but rather teaches you about processor/OS level things that you implement in assembly or C. 

Python comes up again in CS 4641 and CS 3600 (ML and AI), as well as other courses. But at the upper levels, it highly depends on the course as you will be taking more specialized courses. 

If you have credit for CS 1301, you might not really need to refresh yourself on Java if you plan on taking CS 1331. They go through the basics very much in depth. If you’re jumping straight into CS 1332, then yeah you should be familiar with Java, at least at the syntax level.",positive,0.9503,positive,0.1144848484848485,03/15/2021

comments,"That's a solid choice for a thread as well.

Definitely very data heavy on both threads and good exposure statistics and math.

You'll still need some practical experience as there are a lot of things that aren't taught in college.

From a software architecture point of view, typically you'll have some transactional system that feeds data into a data-warehouse for pre-aggregated and pre-defined metrics that will then be used by a BI dashboard or other BI and data science tools. Sometimes, if you have lots of transactional systems, you might feed them into a data lake first, and then feed data from the data lake to the data warehouse.

90% of data science is cleaning and getting the data in the right format before you can apply the data science to it and extract meaningful insights.

Some companies do a good job and have solid KPIs and Metrics and good systems in place like a data lake and data warehouse that stores the information in a nicely structured format with hierarchies and dimensions.

Unfortunately, 99% of the time, companies just have a transactional system that they extract data out of and do out of core processing. You'll often find the data is incomplete, full of orphaned records and inconsistencies. It really depends on how strong the tech culture is at the company. You can do some great technology work in non-tech companies because there's less friction and more opportunity, but it also comes at a cost, as you have to manage more parts of the business, deal with bad data and poor practices.

There are really a lot of facets and roles in the data science and BI fields and it really depends on how far and deep you want to go in the field. You could be the guy that just gets the clean data and runs the experiments to produce the raw results. You can be the solution architect that does it all from locating, extracting, and cleaning the data, to building the production pipeline, and finally, the BI dashboard to review the results.",positive,0.9061,positive,0.16118102327779743,03/15/2021

Clemson being seeded higher is a little bit more perplexing, but they had a much stronger non-conference showing than Tech did, which matters more this year than usual since the ACC hasn't been particularly strong.  They beat an Alabama team that is playing as well as anyone right now and had double-digit victories over tournament teams Maryland and Purdue; Tech's best non-conference win was against a Kentucky team that went on to have a historically bad season.

Clemson lost to a brutally bad Miami, and UNC lost to Florida State. If they're such a good team, and the conference is so weak, why are they not being penalized for doing worse? And what about the fact that we beat UNC head to head, and split Clemson with a +16 point differential in what should have been a clean sweep? And Tennessee didn't play anywhere near their ceiling, so giving them points for having the potential to be a good squad when there are a ton of teams who actually were a good squad is fucking bullshit.

If you're giving UNC credit for losing early in the season while handling COVID concerns, then why is Tech punished for losing the first two games while handling COVID concerns? If Tennessee gets credit for their potential because they beat an overrated Florida team by double digits, why does Tech not get credit for beating Clemson by double digits?

And I watched a lot of Tennessee basketball. Let's not get carried away exaggerating their performance because they played a good game against Kansas and Alabama.

The head-to-head win against Carolina was in December, when they were still figuring themselves out (young team + Covid = bad start to season).  Not saying they couldn't beat them now, but the wiseguys in Vegas would pick Carolina.

Point differential (and insane buzzer beater) aside, they split with Clemson so that's mostly a wash in the committee's eyes.

And Tennessee has shown flashes--they smacked Kansas around at the end of January, handled a pretty good Florida team by double figures twice in a row, and gave Alabama everything they wanted in the SEC tournament.

Georgia Tech would probably have gotten a bit more respect if they could have beaten Virginia and Florida State back to back (I know that situation wasn't anything they could control).",positive,0.9151,positive,0.08906250000000002,03/15/2021

comments,"&gt;A BMI over 25 seems to be super common. Frankly, that's quite disappointing. Obesity may have a genetic factor, but being overweight is just a lifestyle disease. Quite unfair that healthy people have to wait

Why is it unfair that people who are more susceptible to averse reactions (serious illness, death) due to COVID 19 would have access to the vaccine before people who are not impacted by those pre-existing conditions and thus less likely to die if infected?

Also being overweight is not a ""lifestyle disease.""  That statement is highly offensive and reflects a real lack of knowledge about BMI as a flawed metric, the wide diversity of people's set point weights, and the plethora of factors that may alter someone's weight (eg: antidepressants, other medications, disability.)  Maybe you could benefit from some education about the concept of Health at Every Size because the words you have said here are highly damaging and contribute to fatphobia.",negative,-0.9878,negative,-0.08215686274509805,03/15/2021

My suggestion would be try to see through your next semester. Plan on which courses you're gonna take (roughly). Ask to ppl who took those classes that how much they usually spent per week. Plan how much time you're gonna spend on your other commitments (part-time work, working out, basically any other routine thing). If you still have meaningful amount of time (say at least 6-8 hours) you're good. Start reaching out to profs! And don't try to take a lot of classes that semester, research takes more time than you would think (refer to learning curve)

comments,"I don't regret much\*, so I'll list things that I think I would regret had I not done them

* co-op (only for the professional part; leaving friends every semester makes it difficult to strengthen friendships)
* study abroad - I did GTL; it was frigid, the teachers were hit-or-miss, the roommate showered 3 times all semester, and the weekend travel made it all worth it and more
* marching band - this is number one. Marching band isn't for everybody, but having a group of people that love doing things with you is something that will outlast college in a good way. Marching band also comes with travel, field access, and ticket perks, so there's that, too
* fraternity/sorority - I was in a band service fraternity. This helped to form a closer group of people that I bonded with and still talk with nearly daily (GT basketball thanks for the endless conversation starters).
* Taking classes because I wanted to / not trying to graduate in 4 years - Yes, I realize this is not financially viable for many people. But taking lighter loads and classes that interested me (whether or not they counted towards my degree) made school a lot more fun and a lot less stressful
* music/arts - While music and other arts are also ""work"", I found these things to be wonderful for the soul and well worth the time that they took.
* skipping homework - You read that right, I skipped some homework and don't regret it one bit. I had a few teachers that assigned far more homework than necessary, so, other than the grade impact, it was a total waste of time; I was repetatively doing things I already knew how to do. As I got busier, I skipped some homework that I knew would not impact my letter grade. Sometimes, instead of solving problems, I would write a short blurb that I had no time and, if I were to do the problem, the sanity check would be X. That way I at least conveyed that I understood the material (you won't believe the amount of credit I got for these assignments). 
* Going to sproting events: I attended at least one football, baseball, men's basketball, women's basketball, softball, tennis, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, and volleyball competition. All were worth attending to cheer on your classmates (and for pure entertainment).  


  
\* I'm really really really really salty about some other things, but there's not much I could have done except go to a different school

You can purchase specialty plates specific to a variety of universities, sports teams, etc. You do so through Georgia DDS. To my understanding, you can order such plates directly online and do not have to make a trip to a physical DDS location. Keep in mind, having such plates accompanies extra annual fees and one time purchase fees that renew at the same time as your tag expiration each year. Where a standard tag fee may be $20 to renew annually, having specialty plates may tack on an additional $35 annually.",positive,0.4278,neutral,0.011111111111111112,03/16/2021

comments,"It's because Asians don't have a ton of political capital in this country. There aren't a lot of Asians anywhere for Asians to specifically be targeted by politicians. Think about how many times Harris mentioned that she's black during the campaign, and then think about how many times she mentioned she's Asian. You would've though that being Indian was an afterthought to being Jamacian.

I mean, honestly this is the same for Native Americans. Native American populations suffer the same kinds of socioeconomic disadvantages as Hispanics and Blacks, but you rarely see campaigns for Native American populations. The last time America paid attention to Native Americans was when Warren claimed that she was 1/whatever Native American and people blew up about it. 

Asians also tend to be apolitical. A lot of Asian immigrants come from countries where it's better to keep your head down and carry on. This makes them easy to bully. It makes Asians an easy target for racism from even other minorities. Remember when Kenyon Martin told Jeremy Lin he shouldn't wear dreadlocks when Martin has Chinese character tattoos? Nobody else does either. 

All of these factors contribute to the sad reality that hate crimes against Asian Americans tend to get buried quickly or not reported on at all. When a bunch of Asians get murdered, it's assumed to be a coincidence. When a bunch of blacks get murdered, it's assumed to be a hate crime.",negative,-0.9886,neutral,0.009241452991452993,03/17/2021

comments,"(Quick nitpick, the term Asian is almost entirely useless as it lumps 4 billion vastly different people together. These hate crimes seem to be directed against East Asians specifically)

Asian-Americans are in a unique situation where they have low political power, but immense economic power. Asian American households as a whole make 40% more than the median household income, with Indians as the highest-earning racial group in America but people like the Burmese and Hmong being relatively poor. Asian-Americans dominate Silicon Valley. But, aside from small swaths of California, are not concentrated enough to matter in terms of votes.

Historically, another group that commanded economic power, but not political power, was the Jewish people. They made an easy scapegoat. I'm not saying that another holocaust will happen here, but many bad things happened to the Jews outside of the holocaust - in general, they were not treated well in most European nations until very recently. 

Combine this dynamic with the new cold war arising between China and the US and it's troubling to say the least. I'm not really sure what to feel as an Indian American.",negative,-0.9714,neutral,-0.010627705627705625,03/17/2021

comments,"From searching my Outlook inbox for Clery alerts from the last four years, here's what I've found for on-campus robberies:

Fall 2017:

* 1 armed robbery (Tech Square)

2018: no on-campus Clery alerts for robberies

2019:

* 3 phone snatch and grabs *(Ferst @ Atlantic, Atlantic @ Tenth, State St b/t Ferst and Tenth)*

* 1 street robbery *(armed with pellet gun claimed to be real, NAve @ Techwood)*

2020:

* 3 armed robberies *(suspect then gave victim phone back and told them it was a prank, Williams near Fifth; Fourth b/t Williams and Spring; Paper Tricentennial parking)*

* 1 armed carjacking *(victim shot at suspects then fled/never reported incident so maybe not random robbery, WaHo)*

Now, Clery alerts don't cover all incidents (mainly just ones with the potential to represent additional threats to campus), but they *mostly* give us a good idea of how frequent it is. That said, that's not exactly a lot of robberies, especially compared to the off-campus stuff. Obviously, zero every year would be ideal, but the reality of any city is that robberies do sometimes occur, even infrequently in very safe places like campus. Still, it's true that robberies do occur on-campus, although it seems to be *relatively* infrequent.

Now, like you said there are other incidents of theft that don't involve confrontation (e.g. theft of bikes, backpacks, etc.). While those are obviously less than ideal, they're easier to mitigate and don't represent as significant a threat compared to robberies (with confrontations).",positive,0.9765,positive,0.19270833333333334,03/17/2021

See the **much** greater number of alerts we receive for off-campus robberies. Why would they be more stingy with on-campus alerts, considering that on-campus incidents are a much bigger deal than off-campus?

Furthermore, you say they're a small fraction of robberies actually taking place, which I'll admit very well could be the case, but you need to provide evidence to back that claim up. Looking at the [recent crime logs](http://police.gatech.edu/crimelogs), I can't find a single robbery. Theft of unattended property, sure, but no robberies, which involve force against someone. With one-line logs, there's also no way of knowing whether it's a student committing the crime or someone unaffiliated with Tech.

I'm more than willing to be proven wrong (and there probably are *some* that slip through the cracks), but you haven't provided any evidence that there are additional robberies on campus beyond these in any remotely significant numbers.

comments,"I'm assuming your comment it mocking OPs last statement at the end. What I understand from his last statement is something along the lines of

""Some black people are racist it's not just white people""

Which is true. Some white people are victims of racism. Some asian people are victims of racism. But the implication of the statement is a problem.

The implication of the statement is that because some black people are racist that it somehow justifies not caring about them as victims of racism. Or that we should shift out care from one issue to another. The implication itself is somewhat racist because the ""well at least they weren't white"" implies they think that the only care for racism is along the lines of race itself. 

Like, we can only care about racism done by white cops? Which is not what BLM or other recent movements are saying at all. And believing that is exactly what racist people want you to believe. Real racists want to continue to separate people and issues along race lines. This fight against racism by BLM or the fight against racism and the violence against asian americans is the same fight.

The black Americans that shouted racist slurs at OP have more in common with white supremacists than they do with you or me. Their anger and racism may come from a different place. But the outcome and their actions are more similar to eachother than they are to you or me.

They fight on the same side. A side that means to divide us.",negative,-0.9984,neutral,-0.004464285714285714,03/17/2021

comments,"&gt; It's highly suspected that the shootings are an Asian hate crime

It's literally not. I'm not here to tell you hate crimes don't exist, because they clearly do. That said, assuming events are hate crimes with no evidence and then basing a huge decision off of that assumption is very poor judgement. More useful to you might be general crime statistics, in which Atlanta is very poor. Campus Police do a good job keeping campus safe, but there are defintely areas nearby that I would avoid.

&gt;Law enforcement officials in Georgia Wednesday said the shootings do not appear to be racially motivated but stressed the investigation into the deadly shootings is ongoing. A 21-year-old male suspect in the shootings was taken into custody Tuesday night following a police chase.  
&gt;  
&gt;Captain Jay Baker of the Cherokee County sheriff's office said that the man claims to have a sex addiction and that the businesses were a “temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“It is still early on, but those were comments that he made,” Baker said, adding that investigators have not found potential political or religious motivation for the attacks.

Neither the left nor right attempted to garner the vote of the Asian community.

I think this post is a good example of what I'm talking about. We like to pretend that civil rights is a monolith, advancing everyone at the same time. That's simply not true. Civil rights organizations have their own agendas, and we shouldn't expect them to push another group's agenda. However, don't pretend to support the Asian community only to toss them aside when push comes to shove. People like to virtue signal their support for other minorities, but it's really just an empty promise. Hell, you even went with the ""I support the Asian community, but &lt;here's my own agenda&gt;"" template.",negative,-0.5007,positive,0.08869047619047617,03/17/2021

The pure nature of GT and it being a tough school is enough reason for the student body to feel disconnected from one another, add COVID and isolation to that and I think the results are clear. This year has been extremely lonely for many people. With that being said, we have listed multiple resources if anyone is feeling that way.

The Black and Hispanic vote are the most important race-based blocks, at least on the federal level. At the state level, that effect is much less pronounced due to efforts such as partisan gerrymandering. 

Can you even name a prominent Asian politician? And don't give me Kamala Harris. She's part of the problem with why Asians have so little political capital.

Time and time again, when racism from the Black community to the Asian community has occurred, there is radio silence from prominent Black civil rights leaders. However, whenever white people start shooting up Asians, we get people hijacking the events to push their own agendas.

That will just be too many for you to handle. I saw different kinds of bullying on Asian students/research fellows here during the past 5 years. Nobody cares and nobody actually took any action.

There is no online dictionaries include ""yellow dog"" as a slur. There are other usages though. \[1\]\[2\]\[3\] In addition, my impression is that using ""dog"" as an insult is not common in English. ""doggy"" is also not an insult in English. However, it is a common slur in Chinese to call someone a ""dog"". \[4\] As an amateur in linguistics, I am genuinely curious if ""dog"" is also treated as an insult among specific group of African Americans now... because in some dialects of African-American Vernacular English, ""dawg"" is more like ""dude"" or ""friend""...?

comments,"&gt;CSSA is just a student org like any other on campus club

This isn't true. CSSAs at U.S. universities are often funded by the Chinese government. Some even spy on Chinese students who oppose the Chinese Communist Party and report them to the Chinese consulate. Other student orgs do not typically get foreign government funding and certainly do not report student activity to foreign governments.

is it ideal?  nope.  does it suck for Moses?  yep.  do we throw in the towel?  hell no.  the guys who will play with Moses out will step up, no doubt.  may take them a few minutes to get in game pace, but step up they will - and then some.  the team has come too far this season for these guys to not give all they've got and punch above their weight class.  trust me on this one.

maybe more concerning (if i can use that term) - is why right now the headline is saying Moses is out ""for the first round game"".  not sure what's behind that timeframe, but does it have to do with vegas odds/brackets being filled out, etc.?  is it only a mild illness (my word choice) that he hopes to clear by Sunday once we beat Loyola?  only time will tell.

comments,"I’m CS not civil engineering but here’s my 2 cents:

1a: It varies week to week, but a rule of thumb is 3x the number of credit hours. Another idea is treating it like a 9-5, so 40 hours. I don’t really do a lot of reading for my classes, but if you’re trying to be a perfect student and do everything they ask it’ll add up to a lot, but otherwise I’d say it’s manageable.


1b) Sometimes yes, sometimes no. I tend to like to complain and you’ll see a lot of negativity here, so there’s certainly downsides to every class. But a lot of classes teach you really cool things, and if you look at what you knew before and after then you can enjoy yourself. You do have to look past everyone else’s groaning to decide if you actually enjoy it. Also liking a class can depend a lot on the professor.


2) BC (before covid) I was in the marching band, which practiced 3x a week plus game days and other commitments. On top of that, a good method of socialization was getting food with people and do schoolwork together. I’d usually have some sort of social event each weekend (band party, frat party, small get together with friends, etc). Since covid, I didn’t do band but I’ve joined yjrd which is a 2 hour commitment a week, plus I exercise for like an hour or so a day, plus I cook for myself, and I’ve taken to reading in free time, and socialize safely a few times a week. Yes, school is the center of my life, but I still feel like I have time to live.


3) I’m happy here. I’ve considered how I would’ve felt at other schools I applied to and I never regret choosing here. I love that it’s a rigorous school and that everyone you meet must be pretty smart, and that no ones really just here to be at college. At the big state school where I’m from, people definitely go for a few semesters to just party and absolutely do not give a shit about succeeding in classes, and that would demotivate me so hard. That’s hard to find here. We’re all here for a reason, otherwise they’d probably have gone to UGA or stayed in their own state. I’d say I’m fulfilled. I like my classes, I like my peers, I like that I’ll feel prepared to graduate and that I’ll actually feel like I deserve a job.


4) It really depends. Some are really good and really passionate. Some are pompous assholes. I’ve had only a handful of professors that i really felt cared about me personally, it’s nothing like high school, and that’s because I’ve mostly been in 300+ person lectures so I don’t have personal interactions with them. But I’d say most professors want their students to be successful and care about their learning outcomes, and that’s enough for me. I’m generally a successful student and again my lectures have been huge so I haven’t interacted with professors personally much, but when I have had one on one interaction with them (ex, office hours, asking a question after lecture) they definitely want to help you fill in whatever the gap is. In summary: some are dicks but most are kind


5) I haven’t explored enough beyond campus. I was here three semesters BC and was just about to start trying to explore more. The museums/aquarium are great. There’s good food of varying costs. It’s fun to go get fast food with friends. I’ve gone thrift shopping a few times, and to a farmers market. If you are not fulfilled by campus life (and between studying and a club and normal on campus events, I don’t know a lot who aren’t) you can certainly find more around Atlanta.

Moses then went up Mount Nebo to the top of Pisgah, looked over the promised land of Israel spread out before him, and died, at the age of one hundred and twenty.

It's quite possible that he targeted primarily Asian workers as well, which is a race-based hate crime. I was disputing that we should assume that, though. It is plausible that the only reason that most of the victims are Asian women is that a substantial proportion of massage parlor workers are Asian women. Jumping to conclusions on that, particularly if it affects a decision as large as choosing a college, is poor decision-making.

He shot them because of his racist Asian sex fetish. He is the one who wants to dominate women, and targets Asian women because he perceives them as weaker than he.

1. I am currently taking 4 classes (16 hours, 1 was a minimester that has ended and I dropped one class earlier this semester, so I started at 6 classes. Aggregate current hours is 12.) I spend about 20 hours a week on assignments and studying, I would say. It's hard to guess, though, since it's broken up. I like my classes, though of course they're not all easy. 
2. I have a  good balance, but not everyone does. It's something you have to pay attention to and manage. I take a half to a full day off from schoolwork and the pressure to do schoolwork every week and allow myself to relax. 
3. I would say I am generally happy here, but the quest for eternal happiness is a fruitless goal. Even the happiest people have dark moments, but I would say that on average I am fairly content and happy with my choice to come here. 
4. Some professors care and some don't. But I'd say on average your professors want to talk to you if you have something interesting to discuss and want to help you succeed. 
5. It depends on what you're into. Atlanta is a big city, so there's something for everyone, but you have to know where to look. Don't be afraid to ask around until you find what you're looking for. I'm a big classical music buff and a classical musician, and I have a teacher here that I take lessons on my instrument with and I attend the ASO whenever I can. So I found my interest in our world-class symphony and the GTSO, and whatever your interest, there's something for you too.

Long answer: In theory, no you should not face any issues.  In practice, the authorities or bureaucrats usually only pay attention to you if you get attention from others.   Protesting a generic injustice won't ruffle any feathers.  Protesting a specific group or institution (politicians, etc.) could be construed as agitating if a case worker/agent/official gets wind of it.    There is a new administration in office so there is less incentive or cover for subjectively penalizing resident aliens for participating in legal activity.

However the business cannot be operating, meaning no revenue or salary to the owner whom with F-1 Visa. In this case, the entrepreneur has two options. One is to use Optional Practical Training (OPT) or acquire H-1B visa, which most of people choose to do.

OPT is granted to both undergraduate and graduates students after at least a year of studying in order for them to pursue jobs that are related to their study. OPT is effective for 12 months. Although it is a relatively easy way to practice, there are several drawbacks if you are an entrepreneur. First, it only lasts for a year. After that time, one must leave the country. Second, OPT has to be related to the most recent degree that one acquired.

If coursework doesn’t stress you out, but 8 hours of school a day did, you’ll find that in college you are in about 3 hours of class every day. And classes switch are diff most days (because college classes are generally either MWF or T/Th). So college classes are less monotonous and don’t take 8 hours of lecture a day.

comments,"i'm just speaking from my own experiences here; things might be different for you. personally my own mental health got much better overall because of the really cool environment here. there's so many cool people! and there's much less monotony. additionally imo being on campus and just being able to go outside and walk whenever has helped me a lot, as well as the fact that it's easier to hang out with friends. However, I can definitely testify that it's a rigorous school, which makes you busy if you don't manage your time really really well and can lead to terrible stress and breakdowns. I think the not having time for extracurriculars and being stressed is super common, but you can avoid it by prioritizing mental health (e.g. taking lighter semesters, being intentional about giving yourself rest time, etc). There are definitely lighter and heavier weeks, it'll depend on your classes and your schedule. I'm not sure if I'd recommend going to a different uni w a worse program, but I would recommend taking your time here and taking slower semesters (i.e. 12 credits) if you're able to.",positive,0.8943,positive,0.09600694444444446,03/18/2021
comments,"Hey there, I came to GT after spectacularly burning out post-high school. Here’s my take: unless for financial reasons you absolutely have to, don’t feel the strict need to graduate in 8 semesters. You can break up the stress of school by doing Co-Ops, or lighten your course load by taking summer classes, or even just taking a semester or two longer to graduate. I’m a little older than most of my peers as a result of these strategies but I don’t regret a thing. If you already struggle with mental health, I *strongly* recommend taking a gap year (or at least a gap semester!) to figure things out for yourself — taking a breather, going to therapy, and learning about your identity outside of an academic context can work wonders.

Always remember that YOU are in control of your life. There is absolutely no shame in the pace at which you choose to take it.",negative,-0.9097,positive,0.09479166666666666,03/18/2021

comments,"To echo the sentiment of the other comments, I've found that if you take somewhat lighter semesters (12ish hours, if financially feasible), it's less stressful than it may seem. Scheduling your classes so that you don't have a bunch of hard classes in the same semester also lightens the load considerably. It's stressful, yes, but I wouldn't say it has to be unbearably so.

Beyond semester scheduling, how much free time you end up with can depend on, to be frank, how good you are at studying and completing assignments. I know people who grind studying for hours on end every day, yet don't perform as well as some who strategically only study a minimal-moderate amount. Some of it may come down to natural ability, perhaps, but learning how to study *efficiently* is probably more important. Some weeks are much harder than others, but there are often nice breather periods, too.

For what it's worth, my personal anecdote/caveat: especially in the latter half of my degree, I've managed to have a decent amount of free time and do rather well academically utilizing this sort of advice. However, my social life has been pretty horrible most of the time, and that's probably my biggest regret as I'm wrapping up my degree: wasting that time. I wouldn't blame that and my mental health on Tech's academics, so I'll take a moment to say that there are a lot of great people and opportunities here.

comments,"Totally depends on the person.

Let's analyze your current plan first

In terms of difficulty: CS 2200 and CS 4476 are hard classes. MATH 3012 and CS 3630 I heard are okay, and CS 4400 is relatively easy.

In terms of workload: CS 2200 has both assignments and projects, and you definitely need to reserve time for them (it's 4 credits for a good reason). CS 4400 is fine for the most part, but you'll need to spend some time on the project, particularly Phase 4, although you get to choose between doing the final exam and doing Phase 4 of the project. Math 3012 just has weekly assignments; I think they're fine. (Can't really comment on the two others as I haven't taken them, though I heard you need to put in some time for your robot in 3630).

So based on the plan, you'll have two hard-ish courses, two medium-ish courses, and one easier one. If that sounds like something you can balance, go ahead. As the other comment mentioned, look back at how you did with 12-14 credits and consider whether you'll be able to handle another extra class above that.",positive,0.9505,positive,0.19298245614035087,03/19/2021

comments,"Sorry for the delay, I was out of the office yesterday. Thanks for your question though! 

Since 1993 I worked closely with the local Community Service Board (CSB) who provide for the mental health needs of the county. Because all of the CSB's integrative housing was in my patrol zone I became a familiar face when a call for service was made. 

Back then the concept for any form of Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) was not going to happen until 2004. CIT training was created by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) to provide mental health training and resources specifically for law enforcement officers when handling mental health related calls. The class truly resonated with me and I have been a CIT officer since 2005 and a CIT instructor since 2009.

In other mental health response areas; I am an instructor for Mental Health First Aid (MHFA), Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR) suicide prevention, as well as a Peer Support Specialist.

Lastly, I am glad to say that five years of PhD (Psychology) coursework was literally concluded today! Next, the dissertation process begins. During these last five years I have been a member of the American Psychological Association (APA), Georgia Psychological Association (GPA), and my local chapter of NAMI.

This may have been more information then you were looking for, but my commitment to people living with mental health issues is a passion both at work and home.

comments,"Subject: Mixed messages from Tech students

I’ve been admitted to ME. I’ve combed through many posts here trying to understand if I can be successful and happy at Tech or if I would be setting myself up for failure - if it’s realistic to believe I can maintain a 3.0 GPA (which I must do - my family can’t afford the OOS tuition without the scholarship I’ve been offered).

There seem to be two camps of Tech students:

Camp 1: Tech is a serious struggle. There are a lot who have lost their in-state Hope/Zell scholarships due to sub-3.0 GPAs. They talk about unfair grading, unfair professors, that they can’t do well with the brainiacs in the curve, that it’s just too hard. They worry about landing a job or internship. Getting out is a Herculean feat. Doing well sounds like a nearly un-winnable game.

Camp 2: Tech is completely doable. Non-brainiacs can get good grades (3.5+ GPA) and have balance that includes both a social life and sleep with a) very good time management, and b) discipline around going to class, studying well/early, asking for help (from TAs, professors, tutors, study groups, etc). By being responsible and proactive they live full lives with academic challenge but also friends, research, part-time jobs, Greek life, social clubs, etc. along the way.

I have great time management skills and self-discipline. I can be responsible and do the work. This is within my control and I have no worries about it. But I also have a 730 math SAT score, putting me probably around the 50th percentile (maybe less?) at Tech. While I’ve always been one of the smartest in the room in school, 65% of students here are economically disadvantaged so I’m sure I haven’t had the rigor and enrichment that a lot of you have. I know I won’t be one of the smartest in the room at Tech, and that’s not within my control.

My questions:

1. Given this information, can I realistically expect to have a Camp 2 experience?
2. If Camp 2 is the reality, why does the Tech reputation lean so heavily on the Camp 1 experience?",positive,0.9776,positive,0.11932323232323232,03/19/2021

There's over 300 students, 6-9 hours of rehearsal a week, plus game days and other performances. There's a pretty wide representation of majors, so all sorts of students are able to make the time for it.

I guess my point is he could have easily targeted an Asian owned business that didn't have these connections so if the Acworth location is also connected to sex, then all three are as it seems the Aromatherapy place was as well.

In the common areas we have a home theater with netflix/hulu/disney+/Paramount+ and amazon prime, our workshop with a 3d printer, laser cutter and a lot of other tools!

The rent is 850 per month plus utilities. In the house we are 3 PhD students in our 3rd/4th year at tech. Reach out if you are interested and if you would like to see some pictures/see the house. The house is located on home park ave next to Papa Johns, parking is available.

I think what you mentioned in your first paragraph is all very good and you should definitely be proud of yourself for doing all that!!!

Personally, I would still come here if I had to choose again.

Separately, it would be nice for professors who gave weekly assignments to allow us to drop maybe one or two more of them. My professor moved ours to be due on Friday instead of Tuesday, but it...still really hit.

comments,"I can't answer all of these but regarding TA/RA positions: lots of people receive funding through these positions that covers a large portion of tuition and a monthly stipend for living expenses. I find that RA positions are pretty good as long as you have the skills and background to do research, get published, etc. It also depends on your supervising faculty member, what their expectations are, etc. which can vary pretty significantly. Most international students don't have TA or RA positions in the first semester. It's much more likely to get it your second semester but I still knew many people that did not and had to pay out of pocket (if you have strong grades, build relationships with faculty through special problems or other avenues, it is easier). The workload will vary based on the class - I've been a volunteer RA for a prof and did way more work for free than the research work I've been paid to do which may not be the norm, but it can vary a lot based on who you're working with.

&amp;#x200B;

Recruitment: lots of companies come here to recruit (big and small), if you're a strong candidate with some previous internship/work experience, good at interviews, you can get great offers. It requires a lot of putting yourself out there and participating in recruiting events. Applying without attending these events is just not nearly as effective. This applies to companies of all sizes.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I wish I realized before picking GT is class size. The on campus and OMSCS programs are pretty large. I was accepted to other good MSCS programs that were much smaller and wish I had chosen those because I thrive better in more intimate learning environments.

They are the ones who determine your grade. If you meet with them and explain your situation, they will most likely sympathize and assist you (from personal experience).

Ok, I don’t have any advice for you since I haven’t been successful either, but I can tell you that you’re definitely enough and don’t let rejections decrease your self-worth and self-confidence. I think we as guys will get rejected MANY times unless someone is super attractive. So just get used to rejections and move on. Regarding dating app, Hinge is relatively decent in terms of match rate. Other ones suck imo. So give it a try. But dating apps are draining in general. You have to use so much of your time and energy to get a few decent matches every month. 
But let me give you a general advice, it’s better that you work on yourself and learn to enjoy your loneliness before getting into a relationship.

comments,"I know how you feel and I’d encourage you to maintain your confidence. I agree that approaching girls in class or otherwise that you do not know is a failing move. Girls (and many men) scare easily here. Without a legitimate excuse to speak to them, you will find them to be closed off to you. 

However, as someone who has been successful, (in the relationship department and general female friendship department) I would argue that your approach is somewhat wrong. 

(Note: if you are looking for a hook up, I can’t help you. Idk how to do that and generally condemn the practice.)

Any way....
Quit looking for a girlfriend specifically. 

Look to make friends who are female. Even with women you wouldn’t consider to be your type or you would ever want to date. Form legitimate friendships with these women. Why? Because girls like guys who are seen with other girls. And girls who are friends will introduce you to other girls who you may want to be more than friends. And just quit trying to date random women, date girls who are friends first. It will dramatically improve the quality of the relationship and likelihood of success. 

One thing to try is if you have a friend who is a little more lucky with girls who goes on dates and such, ask him to politely pass along your phone number to a girl you think is cute and nice that he doesn’t plan on pursuing. If she texts, great. If not, oh well and it took very little effort on your part. I literally had a very successful date this past weekend by this very method. It works. 

Instead of trying so hard to pull things into your lap, you need to let things fall into your lap. And there is a big difference. And by things I mean a girl. My last relationship was completely accidental. I wasn’t looking to fall in love or be in a relationship but the next thing you know, I’m head over heels for this girl. We dated for a year or so and are still friends today. 

Just put yourself out there and then just live life.  Not everything has to be rushed or forced. Ik that is hard to see rn, but it’s true.",positive,0.984,positive,0.11669094794094793,03/21/2021
comments,"This is probably the best advice you're gonna get here. 

Also, I would mention that it's never a good idea to get desperate, because that usually makes it even harder.

I know of a recent GT grad who was accepted into med school at UPenn, Emory and Johns Hopkins, among others.  As for the social life, it’s abundant. Yes, you have to study VERY hard,  yet there are ample opportunities to socialize, and most students find the time.

comments,"Hey, I’m a GT girl. I can try to explain my thoughts about it. First, well maybe it’s just my opinion, but I don’t like dating apps. People there are mostly for short terms or just for having fun. I wouldn’t really advise you to use it (however, one of my friends found a nice long term gf from there, so maybe it works for some). Most girls that I’m friends with don’t use the apps. 

Second, approaching a girl randomly can be scary for you and for her. I get approached by guys very often in class or on the street, and I don’t think I gave my instagram or phone number to any of them. The reason is I don’t know them, and they seem scary even if they are handsome. I’m more comfortable with the guys who I meet through friends or through my clubs. 

I guess if you like somebody from your class, try to approach a girl as a friend first. Ask for help or even better help her with hw or labs. Keep a low key conversation in class and maybe one day ask her to go somewhere together. You can use this strategy in any club or social events as well. The big factor is that she already somewhat knows you and will be comfortable to say yes if she wants to. Don’t lose confidence! There are many single girls on campus. They are engineers and a little more introverted than normal which leads them to be easily scared.",positive,0.9955,positive,0.16637864823348697,03/21/2021

I didn’t know you until hearing of your death. However, having read all the comments made by the people who have had you in their life about you, I am with my full respect and appreciation for the positivity you have brought to the students community. 
As a Chinese student at GT just as you did, I have been challenged by mental disorders. But every time I chose to beat it I became a bit of stronger than were not to. And more importantly, I developed a bigger vision that I have about myself as well as the world. We are not perfect by all means and there’s no need to be. The way we grow is through failures and now I am so glad that I’ve noticed how I have benefited from those failures although some of which may be caused by the same reasons and repeated like it would never disappear. It’s worth you know? It’s worth so along as you are still here.

Where I was, we had 5 ""hard targets"" (who you would expect:  Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Wharton, Duke) and 10 ""weak targets"".  Tech was a ""weak target"" which doesn't sound appealing, but other than UNC and UVA, it was one of the few public schools you could attend and still have a reasonable shot into MBB.

Being a weak target means you have to work harder.  We might take 2-5 Tech undergrads as business consultants, while we might take 30 Harvard undergraduates.  To work harder, you need a high GPA and impressive leadership positions on campus.  It's not enough to be the president of your fraternity, you need to be the president of the IFC, for instance.

One thing to be aware of with MBB is that there is a significant difference between people who prepare and people who ""wing it.""  People who prepare typically spend a year or more studying for the interviews and will pay $10k+ to have a former consultant train them on the process.  They have a much higher pass rate.

The safety net at Tech is that the 2nd tier firms have a very, very strong presence - more so than even places like Harvard or Wharton.  You can always go to a 2nd tier firm, work on the GMAT, head for an MBA, then take a second shot at MBB post-MBA.",positive,0.9228,positive,0.08241379310344828,03/22/2021

1. We only schedule appointments for vaccine we have on hand.  We do not want to cancel appointments because supply did not come through.
2. We do not reserve vaccine in supply for 2nd doses.  Our intent is to use as much as we can when we receive it.
3. Most people who book an appointment that far out will want to change the appointment time later.  That creates a whole other set of problems.

Our strategy here is to allow people who need a second dose the first shot at booking appointments as they open up.",positive,0.5853,positive,0.08653846153846154,03/22/2021

4270 is alright. It's a pretty typical DSP class. A good chunk of the material is kinda review from older DSP classes but you go into some new topics as well. Typical DSP homework that is straight from the textbook.

 WHEREAS in August of 2020, after the creation of the new Registered  Student Organization Policy (RSOP) as part of the settlement of a  lawsuit filed against the Institute in regards to the denial of funding  to a Registered Student Organization, the oversight power of the  Undergraduate House of Representatives over allocations of the student  activities fee was removed drastically changing the Student Government  Association;  
 

AND WHEREAS members of the Undergraduate Student Government Association  began restructuring discussions including in ad-hoc committees such as  the Joint Policy Response Committee (JPRC) and the Long-term Evaluation  &amp; Restructuring Committee (LERC);  
 

AND WHEREAS these discussions have included ideas to change the overall  structure of the Student Government Association in various ways to  better serve the needs of the student body;  
 

AND WHEREAS fundamental changes to the entire association require  extensive and multiple alterations to the governing documents, and in  particular, amendments to the Constitution of the Undergraduate Student  Government Association (USGA);  
 

AND WHEREAS the process for amending the Constitution of the USGA  requires a referendum of the undergraduate student body, a process that  would be tedious for the general student body to be involved with when  numerous amendments to the constitution are brought forward, and would  significantly slow down the process of bringing meaningful structural  changes to the association;  
 

AND WHEREAS The Graduate Student Government Association (GSGA) has  adopted a process for amending the Constitution of the GSGA which does  not require a referendum of the Graduate Student Body;  
 

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the following amendment to Article VII,  Section 2, of the Constitution of the Undergraduate Student Government  Association be made so that it shall read as:  
 “Amendments to the Constitution may be proposed by a two-thirds vote of  the House of Representatives, or by a petition of ten percent of the  Student Body directed to the Student Body President. A proposed  amendment may be initially ratified by one of the following ways:  
 a) By receiving two-thirds of the votes cast in a special election of the student body called by the Student Body President  
 b) By receiving three-fourths of the votes cast by members of the Undergraduate House of Representatives  
 Any proposed amendment must specify which ratification method is being  pursued. Furthermore, the amendment and pursuent ratification method  must be publicized to the Undergraduate Student Body in either the  Technique or an email to all students at least one week prior to a  ratification vote on the amendment. Should the amendment fail to be  initially ratified by one method, the amendment itself has failed and  subsequent ratification methods may not be pursued. Approval by the  Academic Senate, via the Student Activities Committee, shall be  necessary for final ratification.”  
 

THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Undergraduate House of  Representatives calls upon the Undergraduate Student Body President to  call a special election during the week of February 8th to February 14th  of this year to have the student body vote on this amendment and to  publicize it between February 1st and February 7th.",positive,0.7588,neutral,0.0200533473260746,03/22/2021

Of the 3, Tech was the only one that sent out regular notes when students took their own lives. There were cases where a student newspaper might write of suicides but I never received any emails along those lines.

2nd - and this is another tough fact -- men take their own lives at rates roughly two times higher than women.  (another source stated that for adults ages 20-24, seven times as many males as females commit suicide. https://www.stateuniversity.com/blog/permalink/Suicide-and-Suicidal-Behaviors-Among-College-Students.html#ixzz6psVDvlkL - but I can't verify this accuracy).

comments,"&gt;advisors are actively suggesting new and nervous students classloads like 1332, 2050, 2110, and 2 other courses, but how often are they asking the student what their real-life schedule is like 

It was *well known* in the past that CS advisors would always tell you not to take more than two of 1332/2110/2340/2050 in the same semester and the 4-year plans (that I've seen anyway) back this up. I find this hard to believe. 

They're probably not grilling students about stuff outside of class to respect students' privacy. FWIW, this is a two way street. If someone is working 40 hrs/week, what's stopping the student from bringing this up? 

&gt;Are they simply doing this to keep the 4-year graduation rate higher, and help the school's ranks? 

I have heard that schools list 4 year plans for federal reasons. It's well known that most students don't graduate in four years, but if you're an OOS/Int'l student, would you want advisors telling you to stay an extra year? If you're a first semester freshman, the default assumption is not ""this person will be here for five years"". Not everyone will get out in four years, but advisors aren't going to make assumptions before they meet you. 

&gt;Hearing that you're suggesting folks to take 12 credit hours during their first Summer semester, of really difficult classes at that, idk it just makes me sick. 

This has got to be a fringe case. Summer freshman don't usually take 12 hours, and advisors are aware of this. Either the advisor didn't know that person was a summer freshman or they made a mistake (which *does* happen...)

&gt;They get told a schedule is totally doable and then get stuck in their bedroom crying and wondering why they aren't capable of doing the schedule that the advisor recommended? Then they start comparing themselves to everyone else who maybe could have done that schedule? Sure, not totally the advisor's fault at that point, but you're definitely contributing to a negative feedback loop. 

Well, what do you suggest advisors do at this point? They see a lot of students, so unless you frequent your advisor, they won't specifically know your strengths and weaknesses very well.",negative,-0.5058,neutral,0.013288497217068648,03/22/2021

* Something I really like about the school I am currently in is that the courses we have are not just theoretical : a lot of them are about coding something (and we’re graded on the result). It’s something I really appreciated, instead of being graded on a sheet of paper and without any concrete knowledge of what we’re writing about. I find it specially important in Computer Engineering. So I was wondering, how are ECE classes like ? Are all of the classes purely theoretical, and what are you guys usually graded on ?
* Once I get my diploma, I will probably work and live in Canada. So I was wondering if the diploma was valued by Canadian recruiters too?

Hello,

I recently got admitted for an exchange program (fall 2021) to GaTech, I am from Europe.I am very excited to come to the USA for the first time. I am searching for housing for the semester I am in Atlanta, however, except for iHousing, are there other housing opportunities close to campus? If they are already furnished, that would be amazing.  
I looked at housing off-campus, but they often cost over 2000 dollars a month, which is a lot more expensive than on-campus housing.

comments,"Women’s basketball loses money. It costs more to put on their tournament than it actually brings in. If women’s basketball gets more “perks” you know where that’s coming from. Not the money from their ticket sales or tv contracts. It will end up coming from you the student in the form of a larger mandatory athletic fee for students to pay every semester. I personally don’t want to hand my hard earned money over to people that I and most others at this school have never even watched one of their games. I think student athletes in sports outside of men’s basketball and football are already getting a pretty nice deal in a scholarship with room and board in exchange for playing a game that doesn’t bring in enough benefit to pay for itself.

The reality is this isn’t a male vs female thing. This is a profit generating sport vs a net loss sport thing. I’ve seen tiktoks from track athletes about what they get at their championships and for both genders it’s less than what’s provided for the women’s basketball players. The NCAA institutions have to invest more into men’s basketball and football because they need to maximize the profit from those two sports to provide for the rest of the sports (baseball is profitable at some large southern schools) that operate on massive deficits. Men’s Basketball specifically has a lot of alternative options for high school players in the form of the G-league and overseas pro leagues that players will choose over the NCAA if there is not a lot of investment in the players. If the quality of play goes down then revenue will go down as well and then all sports that depend on men’s basketball to write them checks will suffer.",positive,0.9623,positive,0.07311838624338624,03/23/2021

I am sure if a donor is willing to step up and build a top locker and weight room for these other sports, Tech and other schools won't turn it down. But the money gets donated to build indoor practice facilities for football, football locker rooms, men's basketball locker rooms, etc. Probably the biggest non-revenue funding I am aware of at Tech is the renovation of the Rusty C where Mark Teixeira provided financial support as well as Mac Nease, a former baseball player, for whom the complex was renamed.

The NCAA also gives a payout to each member school from the profit made. What happens when the NCAA increases how much they spend on the women’s tournament is the pay outs to the schools decrease. When the payouts to the schools decrease Georgia Tech needs to make up that revenue somehow and the easiest way for them to do that is impose a mandatory fee on students.

The women’s basketball tournament doesn’t turn a profit, nor does the NCAA factor its results into its annual financial distributions to schools as it does for the men.

And that does not even begin to address the money that is pulled in by FBS football including the College Football Playoff (which is not owned by the NCAA). Most NCAA athletic associations do not operate in the black, including Georgia Tech, but many those would if they were not supporting programs that do not generate revenue. I have tried but was unable to find a breakdown of the budgets of all of our sports, but has been generally understood that football and men's basketball fund the rest of our programs. That's losing large crowds at Bobby Dodd last fall was so devastating to the GTAA - that money is crucial to the overall entity, not just football by itself.

So while the NCAA is technically not a for-profit organization, certain programs aspects are very much run like a business with the proceeds going to support other programs. It's the difference between what is stated and what is effective reality. While I may never watch anything aside from football, beesball, and the occasional men's basketball game, I embrace the mission to fund the opportunity of hundreds of student-athletes to pay for a Georgia Tech degree.",positive,0.6629,neutral,0.023507326007326,03/23/2021

&gt;*Where Title IX meets Chapter 11.*

As others have pointed out, collegiate sports outside of Football and Men's Basketball are usually money losers. Women's Basketball does not bring in ticket sales or TV money. 

I've gone to at least one GaTech Women's Basketball game every season (not counting this past season, fuck COVID), the last like 10 years. I usually pay $1 or nothing for a ticket. The bleachers are still always empty. 

At the end of the day, the NCAA is about money. No money means no support. Colleges across the country have taken a hard look at their sports programs this past year. Stanford canceled 11 Varsity Sports after COVID. Stanford is a big school with a lot of money. 

This should be a wakeup call to sports outside of Men's Basketball and Football.

Besides that there are organized flats in Midtown (100 midtown, solace on peachtree, square on fifth) that are withing walking distance from campus and you can always look for individual apartments you can find on craigslist.

You have to go out of your way to find content for women's sports (if there's any at all) on TV, online, on social media, etc. while coverage of men's sports is readily available. I'll believe that programs for women can't earn revenue when they are given the same opportunities to earn revenue as programs for men.

&gt; The reality is this isn’t a male vs female thing 

If female athletes are always earning less, being spotlighted less, getting less resources, etc. than their male counterparts, then how would you describe that?

I wouldn't be surprised if/when it's discovered that a large group of students was trafficking in exams/assignments/etc.  There have even been instances where students have subcontracted out their homework.

It is definitely one thing to come from on-campus, where I am sure the honor code is a part of GT's culture and everyone gets indoctrinated on it from their first day, making it an expected norm, but that is not something that immediately happens for most OMSCS students.  Even the outcomes for academic dishonesty can be perceived differently. In undergrad, or even in an on-campus, full-time grad program, the threat of discipline is a reasonable deterrent and if expulsion is on the table, that's really going to put some fear into someone who put considerable effort to get admitted in the first place.  To an OMSCS student admitted in a cohort of 2000, essentially open admissions, doing this part-time, and already employed, I'd argue there's actually very little appreciable risk in being dishonest, even if they get kicked out, life basically goes on.",negative,-0.9456,positive,0.09836309523809522,03/23/2021

comments,"As someone who thinks SGA campaigns are largely popularity contests, his response seems fairly understandable. However, there are issues with his insistence that Loeffler could possibly be construed as a moderate prior to becoming an active Senator, as well as saying she hadn't made any public political statements. 

Kelly Loeffler on 12/4/19, the day of her appointment announcement:

&gt;	there are a few things folks are going to find out about me: I'm pro-Second Amendment, pro-military, pro-Wall, and pro-Trump. I'm a lifelong conservative, and I make no apologies for my conservative values. I'm strongly pro-life and believe that every life is a blessing. When it comes to protecting the innocent, I don't look to government for the answers. I look to God. [...] I make no apologies for my conservative values, and will proudly support President Trump’s conservative judges [...] I am strongly pro-life and believe the abortion-on-demand agenda is immoral. In the senate, I look forward to voting for S. 160, Senator Lindsey Graham’s 20-week abortion ban. When it comes to protecting innocent life, I look to God because every life is a blessing.

It's simply dishonest to try to claim she'd made no public political statements prior to taking office, and nobody working in government/politics could have possibly believed she was a moderate. It relies on us accepting the idea that he did literally zero research into her appointment and took her office at their word alone (a significant faux pas in politics).

Like I said, I couldn't care less which popular kid wins this election, but his response leaves something to be desired. I know SGA politics is low-stakes, but this is pretty easy oppo/counterargument to find. Slightly surprised the other campaign doesn't have a better narrative in light of his response tbh.

That said, he makes a good point about needing to take a position or lose financial aid funding. However, he should have done more research before accepting this particular position, and, presumably, he could've accepted another position.",positive,0.9824,positive,0.17786357786357787,03/23/2021

But contacting a member of the grievance committee (me), the admin of the program (David), or the VP of conflict resolution just gets someone to check in on the policy. The instructor doesn’t get in trouble. It’s just the method to go from online venting to tangible changes.

Instructors may not prevent students from seeing their graded work, regardless of the reason. They may keep the materials for view only during office hours, but the student must know where they lost points on an exam. The student has the right to see the criteria they were graded by as well (i.e., the correct answer). The grievance committee has precedence on this topic.

I say this with kindness: It is important to realize the limits of our knowledge, and do as you have done in this last comment: give appropriate context and acknowledge what you don't know before giving advice. Here, the catalog is the set of rules that generally applies, but importantly, there are items that the catalog does not cover or is intentionally indescript on because requirements differ between units and the language allows for this. You are right in that it isn't about getting folks into trouble; it is spending the time to get facts straight and have a conversation. Please consider starting there as you give feedback. Generally, if most things reflexively become a grievance vs. a conversation, it sets up a bad precedent seemingly pitting people against one another that doesn't need to be, and when there are real grievances, it delays the process because of dealing with all of the other things that were better a conversation.

Keyword here is attempts, not deaths. Overall if you’re asking if GT has a suicide problem/mental health problem, I’d say yes. I don’t care what the national average is, if anywhere near five students attempt suicide in 2 weeks the school needs to hold an inquiry into what practices are killing students and institute radical reform. 

Unfortunately they don’t seem to view it as their responsibility, although any student could tell them certain policies (like lack of breaks, no accountability for professors who deny extensions/accommodations esp for disabled/ill students) definitely contribute to poor mental health.

Furthermore, the very first step in the grievance process, as outlined in the Catalog under Rules and Regulations, section XX is, ""The student shall attempt to resolve the grievance with the individual faculty member, the department, or the unit involved.""  And noted  at the top of this section is ""The steps of the grievance process must followed in the order presented below."" Thus, by having the escalate immediately beyond the department, you are asking them to violate those steps. This is why you must first establish whether step 1 is met.

To a person who thinks critically that should raise doubt as to the racial motive. I can drive ten miles from my house and find dozens Asian owns businesses. The link here seems more to be the type of business given the travel pattern.

Your problem is assuming things. Why do you assume that the police wants us to sympathize with him? I don’t see any reason to support that. Sadly you appear to be the type of person who sees racism in everything. That’s your choice but that is not using reason but rather emotion.

If sports would be eliminated then support for GT would dry up among the alumni base. It would be viewed as not their school any longer.

2) There are thousands of applicants each year who want to go to a top academic school with the total package of D-1 sports as well. Tech wants a well-rounded student body with a variety of interests, and sports is one of those key things.

3) If the athletics fee is cancelled, and the AA doesn't receive that funding any longer,  it would in no way impact academics. It's not one or the other.

4) Many of your peers get to go to school here on athletic scholarships. Those students are not useless or less worthy than you.

comments,"Hi, you can DM me for more details, but I'll share some info here just in case future prospective students find this post! I'm a PUBP major, and I added on business admin about a year into the major. 

1. Classes: Like all college majors, you'll have good and bad classes. I've found that a majority of my professors have been awesome and interesting people, but there have been some bad ones where it just feels like you're regurgitating info (you can ask me for specifics lol no slandering here). Those were the core classes, so that's pretty typical. We have concentrations, and those have been my most interesting and favorite classes. The professors are very kind, and you can easily reach out to them, unlike some other professors at tech (I came in as an engineering major lol). We need an internship to graduate, and through that, I made a really good connection with one of the professors, and that'll come in handy for grad school if you plan on going. One warning though is that towards the end of your degree, some classes can feel a little repetitive. 
2. Career opportunities: I've been able to get some awesome internships from being a PUBP major at Tech. This sounds snooty, but the name carries a lot of prestige in the area. There's the GLIP program for those that want to get into legislation, and there are lots of organizations in the area that love GT students bc we're so hardworking. The professors prepare you really well for the ""real world"" imo. I've worked with PUBP/political science students from other schools, and they seem to learn more conceptual knowledge rather than practical things, like writing memos and doing hardcore research. 
3. Atmosphere: Really close-knit community, and our advisor rocks! It was hard for me to make friends, but I think that's just anywhere at GT. I have to say that everyone does know each other though, and it's a little less hard to make friends in PUBP than in other majors.",positive,0.9974,positive,0.2185042735042735,03/24/2021

Sorry, I guess I am still on the fence, so I might not be the most useful person to ask.

Some courses may have pre-requisites, and you might have to show proof of equivalent prereq courses taken at Tech to get into courses there, though I never had to do that. 

Basically, you'll want to see what courses have ""transfer equivalencies"" already established at Tech, and see what they transfer back as. There also may be many courses without pre-approved equivalencies at Tech that will help them transfer back, so you'll want to get them approved here before you enroll so that you ensure the courses taken abroad will count towards your degree here. It can be a long process if you go to a university that doesn't have a lot of pre-approved transfer equivalncies (this would be the case if not a lot of Tech students have exchanged there in the past), but totally worth it.

comments,"I'm currently in the Economics program (A.B.) at UGA with plans to attend Tech for the M.S. program in Economics (UGA doesn't offer a standalone master's in ""pure"" Economics).

However, Tech really ""shines"" if you plan to pair your Economics major with Math or IE (especially IE), if you believe that you MIGHT want pursue IE alongside Economics (or even as a close substitute to Economics) you should without a doubt choose Tech. If you are considering a second/double major in business (Finance, Accounting, Economics, etc.), UGA is the way to go, Terry College has a streamlined system where you can double major within the college without having to worry about two separate curriculums (to my knowledge, Tech does not have an option comparable to this).",positive,0.9071,positive,0.20062698412698415,03/25/2021

Since we have ultra low cold storage (not many providers do), we expect they will keep shipping that to us.

J&amp;J is nice in that it is a single dose and only requires standard refrigeration, but that also means that it will be prioritized to go to clinics without freezers or ultra low cold storage.

comments,"GT says they don't explicitly admit by major, but they do say they review you through the ""lens"" of your selected major. Ie if you apply to CS, you are compared against other CS applicants (which is pretty apparent based on the consistent number of admitted CS students each year despite CS's disparate growth in applicants).

Although I don't think GT posts per-major admission SAT stats and whatnot, it's pretty well documented that, at most major engineering universities, CS gets the most applicants, has (usually) the highest average stats, and has the lowest admit %. Notable examples: UC Berkeley Engineering (GT's #1 college in cross-admits) has an engineering-wide OOS admit rate of &lt;10%, but CS is &lt;5%. Carnegie Mellon (3rd in cross-admits): [https://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/pages/undergraduate-admission-statistics](https://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/pages/undergraduate-admission-statistics)

That is very strong evidence that the CS pool is significantly more competitive than just about any other major, and GT overlaps with that pool. I personally think GT allowing major-switching is a great thing, but if it was out there that CS admissions were more competitive, everyone would just apply to different majors and switch. GT obviously doesn't want half the class to be CS majors, so they say they don't admit by major. Based on the data, that's misleading at best, but the wishy-washy claim achieves its purpose.",positive,0.9902,positive,0.1633024691358025,03/25/2021

Don't get too hung up on the wording difference between the two degrees. In general, aside from the 20% or so who go on to do research or similar, most CS grads are targeting software engineering/development jobs.

The difference is that a software eng degree will focus on practical working knowledge (how to use git, how to make a web service), while CS focuses mainly on learning concepts such as data structures and algorithms. The idea is that the practical working knowledge is relatively easy to teach yourself if you have the CS knowledge, while the more abstract concepts are not as easy to teach yourself.

Since the practical working knowledge changes almost completely each decade, most people argue it is better to have a CS degree to have a stronger ""baseline"".

&gt;""which has been called racist and which arguably restricts voting access""

You shouldn't care about what other writer's opinions are when asking for student opinions. All you're doing is tainting the responses you get. ~~I would GUESS there's an article being written that is critical of the bill~~ (*update: turns out this exactly what's happening)* and finding student responses that match that would be convenient. If thats what people think - they'll come tell you in droves, you don't need to preface it.

**My original comment which quotes the original post:**

The ""*reminder""* included here is inappropriately biased for a publication supposedly soliciting opinions. Here is a more fleshed-out description/ rebuttal. Personally I have no idea if the net benefit is good - I'm simply not educated enough in voting studies.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*more rigid identification for absentee balloting*

The majority of Georgians apparently support this, supposedly after seeing how poorly it absentee ballots can be handled re: COVID.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;limiting drop boxes

They are limited are by securing them inside voting locations and their hours of operation to ensure there can be oversight. Its stupid that it ends at 5pm. Mail-in voting remains an option for those who cannot make it to a drop box during the day, however.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;prohibiting food &amp; water for voters in lines

Well no, this just isn't true. It prohibits people who are not associated with the poll from passing out food and beverages. It's an attempt at stopping ""line-warming"" (political action groups handing out things), which people may or may not think is a problem, but what was stated in OP is barely true.

O.C.G.A.    16-5-20   (2010)  
   16-5-20.    Simple assault 

(a)  A person commits the offense of simple assault when he or she either:

(1)  Attempts to commit a violent injury to the person of another; or

(2)  Commits an act which places another in reasonable apprehension of immediately receiving a violent injury. 

[https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-16/chapter-5/article-2/16-5-20/](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-16/chapter-5/article-2/16-5-20/)

Since they drove away it's highly unlikely, sure. However, the point of practicing law is saying that X law applies because of Y reason. 

Your (seemingly rhetorical) question is what was illegal. I'm saying that after a police investigation it could be found that this constitutes assault, especially if the OP felt endangered. But you wouldn't know that until after the police were called. Therefore, it seems reasonable to call the police.",negative,-0.9958,negative,-0.13636363636363638,03/26/2021

comments,"Usually, no, but there are certain circumstances where you'd still want to.

Some scholarships/grants may require continuous enrollment, even in summer terms. In this case, registering would keep your status. Similarly, some may require you to not take more than one semester off from being an enrolled student.

If you're an international student, there are obviously visa and work authorization implications that I believe require Tech's involvement.

If you have student loans, taking 6 months (practically, two consecutive semesters) off from enrollment will result in your grace period expiring and your loans losing their repayment deferral, causing them to enter repayment then instead of six months after graduation. If you're not necessarily going to take classes in the fall, that'd trigger it. Registering will avoid this. If you're going to take fall classes, you don't need to.

Basically, if you need to be considered a full-time student, registering makes sense. Otherwise, you don't need to.",neutral,0.0,positive,0.11989795918367348,03/26/2021

Looks like as a transfer, you'll have to complete a semester before changing your major. It's ambiguous on whether you'll need to complete an intro CS course, but I'd probably do it to be safe.

The question is when will the silent majority who disagree with this hateful desire to destroy, people on both sides of the aisle, going to rise up and tell these dangerous people ""Enough...you will not get away with treating people like this any longer.

Are there any of you (Graduate and Undergrads) who want to share about your experience, prospective positions (I am not really excited doing Consulting), and salaries, etc. anything you want to share is hugely appreciated!!!

I have a second choice: ITM because I know ITM is a great choice and has plenty of career paths, in-demand positions, and competitive salaries.

To the best of my knowledge there is no way to reserve a room in GT housing without actually being registered for housing, which would require you to be paying for a room for the fall as well and wouldn't make sense. For students who move in in the spring, there is a separate spring housing application that will open up some time around October-ish, and then you can go through the process of roommate selection followed by room selection. I am not sure if it is possible to select a roommate who is already in a room during roommate selection. However if there is an available space in your friend's room when it comes time to choose a room, you would be able to sign up for it. It's no guarantee that it will be available, but that possibility will still exist. As for housing at GTL, there isn't any on-campus housing, since campus is just a single building.

comments,"You might want to check your course number there; ECE 4011 isn’t being offered this summer or fall. If you’re trying to take senior design 1, you’d either have to take ECE 4871 or ECE 3872.

There’s multiple factors that you’d have to consider before making this choice. My background is that last semester I worked a 30 hr work week co-op and took 4 credit hours (ECE 3005 and MSE 2001). This semester I’m working a 20 hr work week and taking 12 credit hours (ECE 3872, two other upper level ECEs and extra science requirement). Both this past fall and spring have been extremely tiring because of this and the only reason I’ve been able to manage this workload is because I’ve really pushed myself. It does take its toll a bit.

I will say I think taking a class while interning is doable but only if it’s still online class because you can catch up on anything you missed in class. Another thing you have to consider is if your employer will allow you take a class while co-oping. If it’s your first term co-oping, I won’t recommend it. You don’t really have a clear expectation of what your employer wants from you.

Golden morning light shines through your window as you awake to your phone buzzing. You've gotten 9 voicemails in the last 15 minutes, including one from your new boss, each congratulating you for making it to graduation day. You peer off the side of your bed and see your regalia hanging off the front of your wardrobe. The reality of today begins to set in as you sit up and a wave of emotion overwhelms your senses. You cry. All the pain and toil, the sleepless nights and gallons upon gallons of caffeine, the Hell weeks and constant stress even when you have nothing due that day...it's over. You bawl harder until...in an instant, it's all over. You did it. YOU, and the ONLY thing left stopping you is wearing some ridiculous gown in the Georgia heat and humidity and taking 5 billion pictures with your friends and loved ones. You climb out of bed to finish one last step and start the first day of the rest of your life.""

comments,"I'm a male, so I can't relate to your situation much. Though I hope I never treat anyone the way you've been treated here. One thing I can contribute to is that I used to pretend that I was dumb. I did it because I thought it would make me more likable and to a degree it seemed to work. More people actually talked to me, but I realized that no one took me serious anymore. I sacrificed who I was to try to be more appealing and I started noticing that I hated the person that I was. I eventually started bullying folks (in what I thought was a playful manner, but now realize that I hurt people's feelings) to be more likeable and not get pushed around as much. I hated who I became, so I decided to start working on not pretending to be dumb and not bullying folks like I used to. I started doing this when I went to College. People treated me differently and I felt better about myself. I regret less interactions then when I pretended to be dumb and a bully. I'm still working on myself, but I can tell you that things have gotten better for me. I've learned to not pretend to be an idiot because I'm already dumb enough as I am. I've been working on finding the border between bullying and playful banter. And I've learned to stand up for myself when I feel hurt. I'm happier with the person that I am now that I'm truer to who I am. I've managed to surround myself with people who like me for who I am and don't constantly call my degrading names like ""terrorist"". I actually get treated with respect now that I don't pretend to be dumb. Overall, I'd say it's liberating. 

As a female, you're in a different boat than I am. I've met guys that don't seem to realize that women are people (I guess they never had sisters or mothers). But as a human being, I can tell you that being who you are is so much better than trying to be who you think people will like. You'll meet a lot of people who don't care to get to know you, but eventually you'll find people who like you for who you are. With the dating scene, you'll eventually find someone who you like who isn't intimidated by your intellect; it might just take a little longer. But my whole block of text can be summarized by: from personal experience I can tell you that being yourself is leagues better than pretending to be who you're not. To hell with the kids who get intimidated by intellect. 

~~Side note: don't know if this'll actually work, but if someone catcalls you or harasses you, you should stop and look straight at them with a face of pity with a hint of disgust and say ""Kid, that's kinda cringe."" It's humiliating especially if there's others around. It gives them that feeling that you get when you try a new joke in a crowd and it falls flat. It works on me and it works for me in a plethora of situations.~~

For me, I have a tight-knit group of friends I can bring things to and that helps me. But any of the women's groups could be good as well. If you are really struggling with it a therapist might be able to help.

Some guys here are kinda weird with women— me and my friends have talked about how we just straight up avoid certain men. I’ve seen men talk about how they don’t even know how to talk to women and suggest doing weird things just to get started that definitely would make them uncomfortable. It’s not hard to learn how to treat women like they’re just another person. And also the amount of men with yellow fever at this school is uncomfortable... 

I’ve never had an interaction like that with professors or TA’s but I also don’t interact with professors and TAs and don’t turn my camera on as much as I can. I do notice the tone shift with I do turn on my camera with male TAs when I absolutely have to (I’m not even particularly attractive). I’m so sorry you had to deal with that :((

I’m just lucky that the men I’m friends with and dating right now treat me and other women like people (but if they do something questionable we call out them out which is hopefully helpful to all parties). There’s definitely a population of decent men but I can see it being very hard to find if you’re alone on campus and your only interactions are rando men who are sexist and never learned how to interact with anyone that’s not men.

For one group project I had this semester, one of the guys had his mic on during a meeting while he was in a frat house and some guy leaned over and said “who’s the hot chick?” That was super uncomfortable for myself and the other women in the group, not to mention extremely unprofessional. I feel like I have to work ten times harder to be taken seriously. I shouldn’t be able to tell a difference in the way I’m treated by other men here on days where I present more masculine versus days where I present more feminine. I’ve been sexually harassed on multiple occasions, once by a guy who wouldn’t let me leave until I at least followed him on Instagram. When I saw that he was on the football team on his account, I knew there was no way anything would happen if I tried to report it. And maybe this is wrong of me, but I still feel contempt towards the men who were standing around and heard what was happening but didn’t do anything to help. 

It doesn’t help that sometimes I don’t even feel like I belong or am welcomed into the all-women’s organizations on campus because I’m lesbian and gender non-conforming.

I have a couple stories that might be similar as well. You're definitely not alone.

I was walking to class from west campus and there was a housing maintenance van parked outside on the road. There was a man inside and he suddenly cat called me as I walked by. I had never been cat called before and I felt disgusting. Maintenance at tech housing sucks but I didn't know they also had horrible personalities if they're going to cat call students.  I was wearing a t-shirt and jeans. 

Another time was with another student. I lived in woodruff with other transfer students and one of my friends apparently had a crush on me, which I was oblivious to. He saw me walking from willage back to woodruff so we walked in together and in the elevator, he cornered me and towered over me and just started smiling. If the elevator hadn't opened I would have pepper sprayed him right there but I was frozen. Now I usually don't interact with anyone unless it's in a class. I am in one club with a majority of males but I've managed to become president and everyone in the club is a good friend of mine now and they're all very kind. 

I don't look forward to in person in the fall for these reasons. I really hope things get better for you and everyone who has commented their experiences on this post. At least we have each other. ❤",positive,0.9709,negative,-0.0917142857142857,03/28/2021

They poured it on the other girl, including to the point where they did a very nasty thing to a statue that she had on her desk one night.  She eventually left.  I am not justifying the horrid behavior, but you need to learn to deal as it will exist in the workplace as well.  Try ignoring it.  Maybe you react too much, they know they will get a rise so they do it more.  Sometimes you do need to evaluate your own behavior.  It is not always everyone else's fault.

comments,"I think you may have had good intentions with this comment, but there are several things that are coming off in the wrong way. OP wanted to provide a way for women to share their experiences being mistreated by men at this school. You’re right that each gender comes with it’s drawbacks, and that men’s mental health is a super important thing worth discussing, but from what I’ve seen, these concerns are brought up super often whenever women try to point out that they feel mistreated, as though men only bring up these things to try to deflect the conversation from women. OP isn’t wrong to dislike when her professor compliments her, because women so often receive unsolicited comments on their appearances that it just gets tiring. And many times, the comments just aren’t appropriate. Telling OP that she doesn’t need to pretend to be dumb, that it’s all really up to her, and that it’s basically her fault that she has this “skewed perception” of men is pretty unfair and it’s victim-blaming. She’s trying to address a very real problem that exists not only at this school, but any male-dominated field. Even in non-male-dominated spaces, women can still feel uncomfortable by men. OP isn’t trying to say all men are like is, of course there are good guys out there. But she’s trying to urge all men to think about ways that they may have made women feel uncomfortable in the past and hopefully be more cautious of the way they interact with women moving forward.",positive,0.0626,positive,0.08489087301587302,03/28/2021

But as a girl I think your cat calling advice is legitimately bad. The best thing you can do is ignore them. We can’t know how men will react to being called out, so sassing them or criticizing them can be potentially dangerous. Silently ignoring them is better than receiving retaliation for your criticism. Like. Cat callers can be dangerous, the legitimate best course of action is just ignore them and try to get somewhere bring where you’re not alone.

My point is, cat callers can be dangerous. For the sake of your safety ladies, avoid interacting with them and if anyone starts following you go into a store or busy place, or if you can’t then call a friend. And in case anyone doesn’t know: Don’t ever let anyone know if you’re going home alone. GTPD will drive you back to campus if you’re nearby, as will Stingerettes. Stingerettes will also take you near campus. Don’t spray pepper spray from downwind. Holding keys between your fingers like wolverine doesn’t work, they’ll just shift. Hold them in a closed fist (Eg point sticking where your thumb is) instead. Punch with your thumb outside your first not inside, or you might hurt yourself. Hit with your knuckles not your fingers. Only unlock your driver-side door if you can. A quick look under your car while you’re far and walking towards it doesn’t hurt. Always lock your doors as soon as you’re in the car. Crying baby sounds outside your house at night are probably a trap.

I made a friend in a class and after a month he started acting like he owned me: getting angry when I told him I didn’t have time to study with him, staring at my chest all throughout class, and making comments about my body and clothes. I finally stood up for myself and switched partners when another girl defended me (Im really thankful for her). 
Groups where I have been the only female have almost always been a terrible experience. Some guys would always feel the need to explain things to me and only me even when I fully understood the concept. 
There was a guy that was trying to hit on me in front of the culc, and he wouldnt take no for an answer. He kept following me when I tried to leave. The next week, same time same place, I saw him doing it to another girl. 
There are quite a few more, but this is already so long. I think all of these experiences have given me even more drive to succeed as a female in stem.

comments,"Current RA here!

TLDR: I enjoy building a community w most of my residents and some of the nice perks DESPITE hating management, douchebag residents, and responding to some serious situations. Even some of the serious situations, it's a fulfilling moment to be there for ur residents, and more so to see them grow thruout the yr (im an RA for freshmen). Having been an RA for some time now, I've seen that those who do it just for free housing don't last more than a year. 

1. It's a good amount of responsibility. Broadly speaking, RAs are responsible for the safety of the dorm (responding to fire drills, drunk ppl passed out in the hallway, someone gets locked out of their dorm, vandalism, etc) and building community (getting to know your residents, resolving roommate conflicts, putting on events to help residents get to know each other). It's a different kind of responsibility compared to other jobs cuz u can't leave ur RA responsibilities after 5pm. About once a month, we are ""on call"" and respond to situations that happen over night or on the weekend. I do about an hour of paperwork per week. And we have weekly meetings as an RA staff and 1on1 meetings w ur Hall Director (ur boss) every 3 weeks. U might have to sacrifice ur current friend group (ie. Ur an RA on west campus and ur friends live in nave) but if ur friends w other RAs or ppl in ur dorm, this becomes manageable. Again, another reason u have to like the job to do it.
2. Ya there's a stigma in the beginning but residents tend to figure out how ""chill"" you are about enforcing rules. It can b rough if residents are always avoiding u and don't even make an attempt to get to know you. So u just gotta be comfortable in ur own skin and enjoy the friendships u do make w residents.

3. Not competitive at all. It's a people-person type of job. If u are a normal human being and can hold a conversation u should be good. 
4. RAs sign a yearly contract in which we cannot work other campus jobs (ie. CRC job, TA) or study abroad during that year. We can get paid for research but only a limited number of hours. You can co op, but it has to be approved and within a certain distance of campus

Note, responsibilities vary depending on which dorm u work in, and whether its upperclassmen or freshmen. Freshmen often involve more community building and putting up with stupid bullshit (taking down signs w a penis drawn on it, telling residents to flush the toilet). Upperclassmen require more maintenance related things (responding to broken ac units or leaks) and might require less of a social commitment.",positive,0.9861,positive,0.11470321683736319,03/28/2021

comments,"Sorry you had to go through some of those experiences. A lot of them are textbook sexist. Nobody deserves to have their gender thrown in their face or be treated as an object. You didn’t deserve it. I would say though that the male experience is also uniquely challenging. A lot of women at Georgia Tech utilize their gender as a means to put down other men. It’s, unfortunately, human to hurt others as a means to build one’s self up. Georgia Tech is a place that, uniquely, has a lot of people that put themselves on a pedestal and use anything, including sexism, to fortify that pedestal. 

However, a lot of men, I believe this tips the balance in a lot of ways, aren’t cognoscente of the fact that there is only 30% women and that most of your classes are hyper saturated with the male defeatist, or reinforcement, mentality and that women have to experience that culture ad nauseum. Women have to have it thrown in their face everyday that there isn’t as large a culture for them to feel comfortable. Ultimately, and I stick by this strongly, Tech is not constructed to create community between men and women based on the age of college students and simple numbers. Because of it, you will have to deal with gender being a noticeable construct until there are significant changes in their mission as a school.

1. ""Saying you have a nice smile is someone being nice to you. Say thank you and feel good.""

Im a male but if my professor paused class to point out that I have a nice smile, I would immediately feel extremely creeped out because a) theyre obviously watching me as soon as I turn my camera on and b) its straight up unprofessional and has no place in an academic setting. In fact, I would immediately report it and probably never turn my camera on for that class again lmao.

2. ""You don't need to act dumb on a date. You need to be yourself and if the guy can't handle that,you need to upgrade who you are dating.""

Youre just shifting the blame onto women here. It isnt HER responsibility to fix men's behavior and how they treat women. Maybe look at WHY theres multiple users in this thread saying they feel the same. If men, especially in stem fields like engineering, constantly mansplain and belittle women, its on men to change their behavior. Sure, women can just upgrade and find another man, but that doesnt change the fact that socially immature dudes at Tech will still act like this and create a toxic environment.

3. ""I'm saying you have the power to make a difference in your life.""

Again, this puts the blame on women here rather than looking at the root cause. Its like saying ""just deal with it"". An absolutely useless insight that offers no solution to very real problems youre commenting on.

4. ""Being annoyed by that and by people flirting with you is likely obvious. The guys in the class probably read that is that you don't want anything to do with them so they don't invite you to their study group.""

Lol is it too much to ask for someone to want to STUDY without the people around them constantly trying to flirt with them. So what if she gives a cold shoulder and turns down her peers advances?? Is she only entitled to something as basic as a study group if she flirts back? The fact that men stop inviting her to study groups when she turns down their advances only goes to show how fucking gross those men are and only validates the users points and frusterations.

5. ""I hope you don't think I'm saying it's your fault. That's not what I'm saying.""

I honestly dont want to be rude here. But when you comment on such a post and all your points lead to things the user might be doing or telling her things she can do differently, the post only comes across as blaming her for her action/inaction. Saying she could ""say thank you and feel good"" implies its her fault for being offended at her professors unprofessional comments. Saying that theres a reason the guys stopped inviting her to study groups only comes across as blaming her for her refusal to reciprocate their advances. Saying she needs to upgrade who shes dating blames her for her choices in dating rather than addressing the root cause of WHY its so common for a lot of men to be absolute shitheads in that regard.",negative,-0.9364,positive,0.08260047281323879,03/28/2021

EDIT TO ADD: My wife also reminded me that it wasn't any better after school. She worked on a helicopter flight line and had numerous incidents that were both demeaning and threatening. She broke one guy's nose when he tried assaulting her in an aircraft hangar, and he was fired for that incident. The Japanese engineers she was supposed to interface with from the company supplying the transmission for the helicopter she was designing wouldn't even acknowledge her existence until she got up in their faces and yelled at them. The chief engineer for the fuselage supplier told her ""don't worry your pretty little head about that"", and the VP and project lead in that meeting had to pry his tie out of her hands after she pulled him across the conference table with it. She took a great helicopter anti-torque concept and made it commercially viable with some tweaks to the design and got absolutely no recognition for what she did because, as she says, ""I don't have a pair of balls"".

3. So you are saying that she is 100% hopeless and can't do anything proactive to change her situation.  That's sad.

comments,"Wow. This post caught my eye because of maintenance and it is absolutely NOT okay by any measures to cat call students; that is absolutely grounds for termination with no questions asked. 

There is a culture around the trades which are part of the 'old' way of thinking where it's some norm to look at a woman, check them out from head to toe, and proceed to talk about them in a sexual manner or make some sexual innuendo in a direct or indirect manner once they're far enough away.  

I refrain from partaking or even doing this because 1. It's creepy in itself. and 2. What if you switched the roles and put yourself in their shoes? Would you feel comfortable being looked at as a sexual object? (This is very much a rhetorical question). 

And to think that some of people have wives and daughters or grand daughters of their own...

I'm not victim blaming.  As I mentioned in a previous reply...it's not 100% of her fault but she is the ONLY person in her situation I can talk to. I can't talk to her professors or to her male peers so it doesn't do any good to tell them how they can improve their behavior. I can only talk to her. I can give advice to her on how she has the power to improve her situation. That doesn't mean I'm blaming her. It does mean that she's the only one I'm talking to.

comments,"Hey, I can definitely relate. For me, it started before I even got to campus when a guy said I got into Tech because I was a girl. 

Once on campus, a guy asked what (CS) threads I was and then said “oh yeah, the girl threads.” Luckily though, a (male) friend of mine who was there pulled him aside later and explained to him (1 on 1 so he wouldn’t be defensive) that what he said was sexist, mean, and wrong. He then apologized to me and admitted what he said was wrong. *I really appreciated that, and would highly suggest this method to any male allies!!*

I’ve had a very uncomfortable experience with a former COC TA. He asked me to hang out with him repeatedly and I declined every time. (Being vague to preserve anonymity) He then did something to scare me that made me extremely uncomfortable and anxious. I reported it to GTPD saying I didn’t want to press charges unless he had been reported before. GTPD was great about taking my statement and offered to bring in someone from VOICE. Before this, I’d considered being a TA at some point. But after that experience, I couldn’t imagine being in office hours at a scheduled time or being unable to avoid (if it came to it) other students who might sexually harass or stalk me. 

I’ve also had a close friend (who I’d known over 2 years) insist repeatedly to come over when I was feeling sad and really down. Although I wanted some alone time, I gave in and figured seeing a friend might help cheer me up. It wasn’t unusual for us to sit side by side on my bed and talk. But that time was different. After a bit he put his arm around me and then laid down. After encouraging him to leave and insisting that I was tired and needed rest, he tried to sleep over. In my bed. Keep in mind, I was sad about some boy trouble and this friend had never crossed any boundaries before, so all of this was really new and unexpected. We aren’t friends anymore. Friends don’t cross boundaries when you’re sad and vulnerable. 

All of this to say, I hope sharing my experiences can help other women know they’re not alone. And to any allies reading this, please please please step in when you can. Tell that asshole in the group project that he keeps interrupting your teammates and ask them what they have to say. Tell that friend of yours that he crossed a line and that what he did or said wasn’t okay.

comments,"I don't want to sound like some ignorant person, even though I probably will.

Guys treating you like you are dumb and saying you don't belong at Tech are both obvious cases of sexism. It is wrong.

However, I see the dating situations as irrelevant to any gender issues. Those sound more like personal issues of self-respect. You can't expect to find someone you like by not being yourself. If you are dating someone who disrespects you, that is when you break up. Whether they are a guy or girl, they are a bad person.

As for the study sessions and flirting, I just think that is how guys are. It wouldn't fly in a strictly professional workplace, but that is not what Tech is. It is a college campus, and anyone can do anything they want. Would a group of girls invite a guy to a study session? No.

The rest is actually wrong of those people. While the professor's compliment is not exactly inappropriate, it is still a little weird, and I wouldn't like it either. Obviously, the harassment is a serious problem, but nobody, regardless of gender, should be out at night.

I hope things get better. Thank you for bringing this topic to everyone's attention because some people just don't know how they affect others.

It’s kinda gross and especially demeaning when they approach the situation as “!!!! A female I will be in close proximity with, I must try to immediately sleep with her or lock her down or shoot my shot!” Instead of just you know, treating us like normal group mates and peers. I’m not here as a sex object. Please treat me with respect. 

And before I get all the comments of “oh it’s just a chance to get to know someone new blah blah blah” ok great! Actually get to know us and treat us like we’re just your classmate because we are. You need to remember we are forced to be with you in these situations so there’s no reason you should be going into these sorts of projects with this mindset. You can go in and hope to make friends but please don’t have this expectation of finding a romantic partner because that will impact your interactions and behaviors towards us when we just want to be acknowledged as an equal academic regardless of what’s between our legs. 

I had a groupmate that literally asked out my friend after our first meeting (which was basically just introductions and contact info exchange) and tried to invite her over for dinner. When she said no and said she was a lesbian and not interested, he invited her again under the premise of just doing it as a practice for him. She said no again and yet he continued to lust after her the duration of the project and flirt and make moves. Again, he DID NOT KNOW HER beyond just a “hey my name is..” so it was just odd for him to have formed such a fixation so early on so it was 100% just based on her looks and his imagination &amp; fantasy. It was so cringey and disappointing and discouraging to see him treat her as a projection for his fantasy and not like an equal partner in the project.

I've also experienced some things that made my blood boil.

Some ta's would, instead of helping, just give me the answer on a hw etc, while when my male peers would go to the same ta, they wouldn't give any answers and give some small hints. This helped short term, but didn't give me the best chance for me to learn.

Some of my male peers also ""mansplain"" or talk over me.. I'm not sure if some do it on purpose but either way, it's annoying and exhausting having to tell them you know in a nice way (or just bear to listen) or continue to talk.. They also seem to take the ""harder"" problems without giving me a chance to take the assignment.. or just take it without saying anything.

When I act confident, I'm told I act ""bitchy"" from male peers.

I've been told multiple times I don't belong here or that I only got here because I'm a girl.

It sucks that a lot of stem programs have a small ratio of women, which doesn't help. It doesn't help that some peers have some kind of god complex against other universities/majors.

I often struggle in some classes because I'm like one of the four girls in the class and constantly feel like I need to prove myself to other people.

Though this isn't just a problem here, it has happened everywhere..

Sometimes men won't look into my eye and when giving them a handshake, their hands are limp.. 

I've been told growing up I'd be a good ""house wife""..

One of my high school teachers have picked on females throughout the semester, and at one point, one teacher had told a girl to ""let a man answer it"".

At young ages (12-16), I've been cat called by older men, which I thought was absolutely disgusting for them to hit on underage girls.. 

Regarding video games, I've always been told that it isn't a girls thing... by my parents and friends. When asked what video games I play, they assume phone games or a more ""girly"" video game.. which are perfectly fine, but let women play what they want without the unnecessary stereotypes. I unfortunately have to stay away from voice chat with people and play with friends I know to not get harassed online 😐. Once someone online knows I'm female, some men will over critique how I play or try to give me help/advice when I didn't ask for it. I've even been told by a peer that men are more genetically gifted at video games than women because men were the hunters in hunter gatherer societies.. like okay? That doesn't apply to all video games anyway.. I'm just trying to enjoy my time lol.

Thanks for providing an outlet and discussion post.

I hope we can all, especially women, give support to each other and not put each other's down.",positive,0.9958,neutral,0.04647342995169081,03/28/2021
comments,"You aren't wrong, I just think you're missing my point.  Yes, everyone (regardless of gender) needs to speak up when they feel like their boundaries have been exceeded.  Similarly, everyone else needs to respect those boundaries.

My point specifically is you have a number of high profile cases where people are being assholes and they *know* they're being assholes, and their defense is basically ""well no one ever told me not to"" do things like touch people or make sexual comments, or even telling people to smile.  Thats a flimsy excuse and it shows that the person knew they were doing something that they shouldn't have been, or that was less than respectful.

Treat your colleagues with respect and you shouldn't ever have to get in a situation where you have to be told you've gone too far.

Edit: Also looking at some of the other things mentioned in this thread like TAs getting feedback about their appearances instead of their teaching.  Female engineers being asked to get supplies as if they're a secretary.  Shit like that is not ok and it shouldn't have to be said that it's inappropriate.  So going through life doing shit like that saying ""no one ever told me not to"" is contributing to the problem.",positive,0.7798,neutral,-0.008777777777777773,03/28/2021

I need to choose between the two schools. I am in state for Virginia Tech but my family is willing to send me to GTech if I want to. I know Georgia Tech is ranked higher, but whenever I look at this reddit page or some other online resources it seems like people run on 5 hours of sleep and are consistently so stressed out here. I am willing to put in the work for the extra opportunities, and for the name of the school on my resume, but are there are more opportunities and is the extra work worth it? Also, I plan on majoring in computer science. Also, how is the social life. From the outside it seems VT is better, but I am willing to have less of a social life if my life is set up better coming out of Georgia tech.

comments,"So either you're doing one of two things here:  


1) This is related to your previous comment on my other thread where you suggested that if someone is offended, they say that, and everyone else needs to respect it.  That way if I disagree with your opinion here, I'm going against what I said earlier and your point is proven.  Lol, sure.  


2) You actually don't know what the term mansplaining refers to, in which case, let me enlighten you.  Mansplaining refers to when anyone, typically men, explain something to someone they perceive with lower social standing, typically a woman, that would otherwise be obvious or that they would not explain to someone they perceive to be on the same social standing as them.  


Mansplaining isn't just when a man says something or explains something, it's when they do so with an ulterior motive meant to assert dominance on the situation.  There are plenty of ways that men can have civil conversations and even express their viewpoints to the betterment of a discussion that \*aren't\* mansplaining, and it should be obvious the difference.  


Take your pick of the above as it pertains to you, then continue:   


For example, from this thread:  
"" You don't need to act dumb on a date. You need to be yourself and if the guy can't handle that,you need to upgrade who you are dating. ""  
\- this was called out as mansplaining because yes, every kid has been told this and the person saying this knows so, but they're trying to invalidate the experience of someone else who feels like they're being disrespected in their social life.  


Another example, purely fabricated:  
I have a number of female engineer colleagues, some of which are more junior than me.  Me explaining a topic that they legitimately don't understand is not mansplaining, it's just explaining something to a coworker.  If I were to sit there and condescend to them by spelling out basic processes that I know they \*do\* understand, that would be mansplaining.

I remember that a group of us younger engineers were trying to convince the project lead to take a chance on flat panel displays back in the 1984-1985 time frame on the LHX program, and we were derided for that idea, because the older engineers thought CRTs were the way to go because that is what they had done for years. I just shake my head at memories like that, and there were many.

SENIOR DESIGNS PATH 2021

 

(*=Concurrency allowed)

 

Whichever option you choose, we will sub on Degreeworks for 4011/4012.

 

Senior design options:

ECE 4871 (1) + ECE 4872 (2) + [ECE 3xxx/4xxx, ECE 3XXX/4XXX Research, or ECE 3872 for 2 hours]
This is a 2 semester ECE team project.  You'll work with the same group of students for 2 semesters.

Since this design series is 3 hours, you need to make up the missing 2 hours with ECE 3xxx/4xxx, ECE 3XXX/4XXX Research, or ECE 3872.

 

ECE 3872 (2) + ECE 4873 (3) 
            ECE 4873 is a 1 semester ECE team project.

It is so demoralizing as a woman to think she is being invited to a study session and find out a “friend” is actually trying to get laid.  It feels like a betrayal honestly, like false pretenses.  Like she thought she had a friend that respected her as a person, but in actuality he had an ulterior motive the entire time.  The bait and switch.  Not only that, once the switch occurs she has to figure out how to gracefully exit the situation without the “friend” getting angry and assaulting her.  Someone who won’t leave a woman’s bed when asked (not respecting boundaries) is someone who is inherently unpredictable.  Who knows how he will react when rejected?  She is now so vulnerable all for trusting a “friend.” 

And men wonder why women are paranoid/not trusting smh.  Because she never really knows if he will suddenly try to pull a move and put her in a vulnerable position from which she can’t escape.

I graduated 10+ years ago.  I didn’t learn until i was 24 or so how to spot those boundary pushers.  Once I got good at it, ANYONE that didn’t respect even a small boundary would go into the “not safe” category in my head.  And you know what, no regrets whatsoever.  I don’t feel like i missed out on any amazing friendships or whatever.  On the contrary, i think i dodged a ton of creeps early on.  

I recommend everyone right now to read up on boundaries, how to set them, how to enforce them, how to back up others when they are enforcing boundaries, how not to push someone else’s boundaries, and how to disengage once a boundary pusher is spotted.  Bonus, mastering boundaries effectively is a HUGE confidence booster for young women, and will help in navigating sexism throughout a career.",positive,0.9934,neutral,-0.01680469289164942,03/28/2021

If you pushing back on this guy doesn’t deter him, then the next best thing would be to help your female teammates as they pursue help through institutional channels.

comments,"Hi everyone, I am a third year CS major. I have some questions about taking grad classes as an undergrad, without BSMS: I intend to apply to BSMS in the Fall and hopefully be accepted for Spring 2022. However, it is my understanding that undergrads (even without BSMS) are able to take grad classes -- for example, would I be able to take CSE 6140 to satisfy my BS ModSim CSE requirement (for which I would choose to take CX 4140 for the undergrad requirement), and have that class also satisfy an MS requirement? Although I would generally assume yes, I am a little confused because CSE 6140 is not considered to be cross-listed with CX 4140, but they are in the same ModSim thread requirement of Computational Science and Engineering. **Then,** if I were to be accepted into the BSMS CS program, I am hoping that the CSE 6140 class would then double-count for the BS requirement and MS requirement.

Sorry if this is a confusing question (and very specific scenario), but I would really appreciate if anyone might be able to help! Thank you a lot.",positive,0.9656,neutral,0.04230769230769231,03/28/2021

I hate wondering if I only got here ""because I am a girl"" without anyone even telling me that outright. And I know I deserve to be here. I belong here, I earned my place here, I worked my butt off in high school to get here, but that thought still nags me.

I hate having to wonder if my partner will grow to resent me for being smarter than him. Like, I'm not an asshole about it but I'm intelligent and I don't ever hold that back to make someone else feel comfortable. And I waste time worrying if that is going to hurt the ego of some man I want to spend my life with.

I don't really do ""study sessions""; I think I'm better off learning on my own time. I've gone to a study session with a group of women from a class once, but gee I sure as hell wonder what it's like to get invited to more. I wonder what it's like to have that group to ask questions to, rather than just calling out into the void when I'm confused.

I am so sorry you've experienced such gross sexual harassment. Nobody should be made uncomfortable in the ways the men you involuntarily interact with have made you feel. I'm sorry men don't understand. Please know it is not your duty to make them understand; know your experiences are real and valid, and they have no right to victim blame.

comments,"Hey, I see where y'all are coming from, but I think even in the cases when people do these things, the sexism some people experience become obstacles that are hard to overcome, no matter the effort you, as an individual, put in. For example, a scenario that is of particular relevance to me is that I am looking into doing research within a certain field of my major. However, when I look for professors who are doing research in that field at GT for my MS, I have to consider whether a professor has my best interests in mind. Of course this means considering if they are discriminatory in anyway. Sadly, since some professors have been brought up to think in certain ways about women in STEM, even with tens or hundreds of women proving them wrong over the past however many years through their work and passion, I cannot consider them as professors to do research with. This is even though they might be AMAZING researchers in their field, incredibly intelligent and competent, and their work is very relevant to what I want to do in the long-term. In addition to this, since sometimes discrimination is hard to prove and students have to kind of go off of opinions from other students, and also some of these professors are tenured, sometimes people aren't held accountable and it gets continually worse. Why would I work for a professor that, because of their biases, is not going to support me? Of course I love the work I'm doing, I've worked incredibly hard, focused on improving myself, and all of that! But, for some people, that's just not enough because of their biases. Then, if I bring that up to the professor, if the professor isn't willing to discuss, then it hurts the relationship with the professor even more for no gain. I'm lucky enough that there are other professors doing work that I want to do, but even having to think about whether a professor or a student or a boss is going to be sexist isn't okay. I think situations like this pop up in a variety of contexts outside of academia too, but maybe not as outwardly. In some cases, especially if it is someone with authority in your field or company, it may be harder to focus on just being your best self since that isn't enough.  


I do think the point of just focusing on yourself no matter what people's impressions of you are is an important point for every GT student, just b/c it also helps with dealing with imposter syndrome sometimes and also just pushes you more in your career. But I don't think that's enough sometimes, especially if someone is being complacent about sexism that is a problem with STEM culture and individuals within it. Honestly, from handling sexist professors perspective, I don't really know what to do. If someone has proof or something, hopefully going to department admins helps so people in the future don't have to deal with obstacles. But, otherwise, we have to hope that the newer professors will hold less or none of those biases. That's where I think making these cultural changes at GT and other STEM institutions/companies is important, and just in society in general. A part of that is proving them wrong on an individual level, but I think that there is more work to be done than just that. This is especially true because there have been so many women already who have ""proven"" themselves in the STEM field. In the cases that proving them wrong isn't enough individually, then what are we supposed to do? I think that's where holding people accountable for their words/actions, even as students, is important. And I think that's why it's important to have discussions like this thread too, so maybe people can realize some of the behaviors they're doing are belittling or outright discriminatory to others. Like people in this post have said, because of how people have been raised and how society is now, some people don't even know. That's why I think it's important to make bad behaviors known so people can realize for themselves and change their attitude. There'll always be people who will continue to be discriminatory for whatever reasons, and there'll be people who are supportive of you as well. But I think that, ideally, everyone would want to help reduce some of this discrimination at least a bit. It helps everyone. In particular, for STEM fields, collaboration is super important. Why would people want others to feel like they can't speak up because of discrimination?

  
I think maybe by doing a bit of both (holding people responsible for their words/actions and also pushing ourselves to be the best we can be/reaching our goals), we can improve both our individual experiences and experiences of women at GT/in STEM as a whole!

Finally, here's a post that someone wrote about Sam (they wish to remain anonymous so I won't identify who they are; I removed some identifying information as well):

""let’s have a quick chat! congrats to Georgia Tech for electing another..... cis white dude let me preface by saying that student government is a shit show in many ways. students are doing the work of administration while also being shut out from those discussions (by intention, by bureaucracy, whatever) let me additionally say that there are some wonderful people who were involved in SGA campaigns all around, on every team, including so many UHR representative-elects. It’s a broken beast but it must clanker on somehow finally, this is all based on what I know and how I feel. if something is unfactual, my dms are open. if your feelings are hurt, tough. develop some resilience. Now let’s get to the meat and potatoes! Let’s discuss the Kelly Loeffler deal- Sam Ellis worked for Kelly Loeffler and removed it from his LinkedIn. (a fact) Why it was hidden? No clue. Smells like shame. It was only admitted and brought out well into the election cycle. It was a beautiful statement. A masterclass in Notes App Apologia, if you will. The optics, however, read that Sam Ellis is a white man working towards a career in some policy space and could not quit this job because it would result in a resume gap. The claims of missing housing and pay by quitting can read as disingenuous. Unless, of course, the accused is from a low-income background or otherwise intolerable home environment. In that case: I deeply apologize. Currently, however? I don’t buy it

Furthermore, the defense of this action by others (saying it was slanderous or otherwise implying that critique of that job title was undeserved) is lame as hell. I promise, I do not care that someone played victim after I made fun of their shady actions. Saying that someone doesn’t deserve shit for working in politics just bc politics equates to serving evil people? That shit does not fly with me.

talking about constituents and politicians and trying to equate the harm of their political stances or of serving them is talking about apples and guns. shit does not compare)

Being in politics means you are complacent and active in a very dangerous, very harmful game. It’s all shit. Cry to your mother if you have a problem and start organizing instead. Let’s returned to the accused: Mr. Ellis...

It is very amusing to me that BIPOC rights were discussed as platform points but (to my knowledge) no Black Student Organizations were consulted. Excluding Black voices while using them as a platform point? Does that not read as racist to you? I mean yea this tweet but damn what’s a white boy going to do that legions of white boys have failed to do in the past?

Also during the debate they said they consulted MGC. This was a lie.

Greek Life (espc IFC/CPC) is racist, homophobic, and transphobic. Has been, will be. Abolish that shit. Moving on —&gt; [Kyle and Salmata's] campaign had 34 (!!) violations alleged against them. 1 (one) stuck.

For the elections code violations allegations, I’m not pointing fingers because I don’t know who was filing these forms. To some degree, I get it. You’re playing the game. What I will say though is that this is the part of SGA that is so. so. SO! lame to me. The game???? And as leadership, engaging/condoning in these silly games? That does not bode well and I am not optimistic about the politically charged high school drama of SGA improving. In finality, I’ll say that...I do not give a fuck. Y’all do whatever u please lmfao. SGA is shit and will be shit until it begins operating as a union for students. E.g., Supporting workers? Bullshit. Support the workers union if you’re about it. SGA will only receive my approval when it begins to act as a collective power to empower each and every student. Stay blessed.""",negative,-0.9967,negative,-0.08123352165725048,03/28/2021

It's terrible to think it only really takes 1 person in your work environment to cause waves. I don't think this issue is going away as the 'old guard' of engineers retire. Instead, the issue is evolving. Instead of being undervalued and seen as a fake engineer, the industry now uses us as a token piece, 

Be aware that now engineering companies will force women and minorities into leadership roles earlier than they should be because they want the 'we have x percent of women in technical leadership . This leads to female engineers not having time to build their technical skills and forced more and more into the 'powerpoints and soft skills realm'. Nothing wrong with this move, but if done earlier than you want,  it will force your career path in the future. 

At the end of the day, I have hope that the world of engineering (in industry and college) will get better for the pure reason that women are more and more aware. We are so lucky to have women that have those rare women that have been industry 10-20 years longer then us that help us find our path, earn our stripes, and just be a hell of an engineer.  Good luck and find a company that treats you as a great engineer you are, not a great female engineer.",positive,0.9845,positive,0.13113378684807253,03/28/2021

It really sucks that girls that feel more comfortable and happy in cute outfits and makeup get a shit ton more of these bad comments and interactions. Just because someone has put effort into looking good doesn't mean they should be somehow treated with less respect.

I recently checked the new ME curriculum, and COE 3001 was suddenly added as a prerequisite for ME 3210. With no notice or anything. Is this grounds for me to get some kind of prerequisite waiver from the ME school? This has thrown a huge wrench right into my degree plans and is kinda bumming me out now.

Interesting though... I never had any of this at Georgia Tech myself. But I did 100% get this treatment in the workplace later. It's so frustrating anywhere/anytime... And it often has nothing to do with what you said/did/etc.

I would say... Please take this as a cautionary experience. Think critically about what factors about your peers/classes might lead to overly-traditional thinking, and consider carefully that it will only be worse in a similar situation at a job.

Ultimately, the other LLC options are not fully compatible with CS Majors, as I'm sure you have already discovered.

They are great for some types of people and unnecessary for others. If you like working on extracurricular projects, then you may like to join an LLC.  If you are in it for the social aspect, there are so many other ways of generating friend groups. Joining clubs, music groups, greek life, and religious organizations are ways I've met others.

comments,"ChBE here... here's is my two cents. It's hard, but it's very much doable. However, I think what I would say is if someone could dissuade you from Tech by talking about how difficult it is; it's probably not a good fit for you. I think you need a lot of self-motivation and drive to succeed (in anything but here especially), and if you're easily discouraged you may struggle. 

I don't know if there are any stats on depression rates and although it is very very unfortunate that we do have student suicides, I don't think we have a greater number than what is expected based on the US as a whole. 

Safety wise if you use common sense (don't go out late at night, walk with a friend, etc.) I don't think it's a big problem. GTPD does a lot in keeping the campus safe. Social life is fine, but I'm not really sure what that'd be in comparison too. It's not hard to make friends if you want to and with good time management you can find plenty of opportunities for extracurriculars.

Also, you'd be making a mistake by believing this subreddit is an accurate representation of student culture. Mostly negativity make it onto here as it's a place to rant and no one's coming here to say how much they're really enjoying.

To specifically answer your questions from my own experience.

It's definitely worth it. I went from being a press operator making 12$ an hour to a 6 figure offer in 6 years.

Engineering is hard and I really don't think Tech is unique in its difficulty. Prepare to struggle, but don't let it consume you. Life is more than just your course work. It won't feel like it when you're in the middle, but just try to take care of yourself.

A few things that have helped me:  I've looked into professional organizations for women in industry and attended their events and virtual meet-and-greets.  Additionally, I find female role models, through older classmates, professors or grad students that I look up to, or women in leadership in my internships.  I've also started listening to podcasts about women in STEM - specifically, [Double Shelix](https://www.doubleshelix.com/) and [Women in TECH with Ariana](https://www.wallwaytech.com/podcast).  There is an excellent [article](https://hbr.org/1995/09/the-power-of-talk-who-gets-heard-and-why) about how linguistic differences in men and women affect how we perceive each other in the workplace.

I agree we all should be considerate of other's feelings and space; the specific case you present makes sense. However, if a lot of people choose to deal with the opposite gender in a technical space by avoiding them, the marginalized population is hung out to dry.

- minimise unnecessary outside responsibilities where possible. If you don't need a part-time job, don't get one. If you don't need to have a leadership role in a student organisation, maybe just participate instead.
- make your home comfortable and a refuge. Try not to study there if possible.
- find a quiet regular place to study and make it part of your routine. A lab, the library, etc. Just make a place your go to spot.
- get 8-9 hrs of sleep a night

comments,"GT is a pressure cooker. It will not give much in the way of positive reinforcement unless you truly take initiative in looking for it. I’m finishing up my degree soon and the tradeoff thus far, for me, has been time I would’ve spent on my personal development for a lucrative engineering degree. A mainstream fun college experience was given up for a dedication in my craft. GT can be very stressful. The classes are hard. Many people, including myself, did not have the life skills to handle the workload when they got here. It’s a tough adjustment from high school. The depression rate is higher than normal but that comes with the territory of being challenging. The social life is sparse if you’re looking for intense fun (parties/bars), but there are lots of people that like to do simple things like video games, board games, and have conversations. In a good way GT is unique in that you are surrounded by people that are challenging themselves to become harder working, efficient professionals. You won’t be alone in that sacrifice at all. The downside is that most people are stressed and aren’t looking to go out and spend much time on experiences outside of academia. the city is not safe to go out in at night by yourself. You have to be careful crossing the bridge and you should always go with a group, at night, if it isn’t 5th st, but the campus itself is extremely safe and I walk it at all hours of the night without problem (as a 6’1 male). Whatever territory comes with stressful work, that’s tech. There are very interesting people that have profound life insights all over the place.

Now, whether you should go or not depends on what you want. Do you want to stimulate your emotional development? Tech isn’t for that. There isn’t much extra time. Do you want to become a person that will get a fast track in problem solving, networking, and a true understanding for whatever major you choose? Tech will most definitely give you that. The bare minimum at tech is a full-time job. The professors are profoundly insightful. Your classes will change how you think and approach work. If you think you can do it without getting bored of grinding for 4 years, Tech is a great choice. If you have a lot to figure out in terms of what you want out of life, Tech would be like Russian roulette.",positive,0.9937,positive,0.16149342259807373,03/29/2021

This post really has made me reflect on my years at tech and think about how I've talked to my female peers as well as being a bystander to any sexist behaviors that other men have perpetrated while I was in the room. Thank you for sharing your experiences and making me really think about my actions and how to improve them later in my professional life.

One thing I want you to know is that the people that try to degrade you by saying that you only got into tech because you're a girl are literally just projecting their insecurities and lack of self-worth at you. Do not listen to these people. These are the same types of people that will use gender (or even race for that matter) as an excuse when they receive any form of rejection like so:

""Ah I obviously didn't get that job because all the company needs to fill in their gender quotas.""

""Well the reason why she got an interview was probably because she's a girl""

Stuff like this is just an attempt at pointing the finger at other people to cover up their own failures rather than looking within themselves to see how they could improve or work harder the next time to achieve success. It has nothing to do with your abilities and it has everything to do with their lack of them.

To all the women that were told that they got into this school because of some gender quotas, you belong here because you're a capable, smart, and dedicated future engineer and not because you're a girl.

comments,"Hey 21F here who grew up nowhere near a city.

I like it here. GT was a great fit for me. I love that pretty much everyone here wants to be here. It would seriously demotivate me if my roommates or friends didn’t care to be here and were just here to party/“get the college experience”, but people who want that generally go to their big state school, not a top ranked engineering school. That doesn’t mean we don’t know how to have a good time - pre-covid there were frat parties every weekend if that’s your thing, but everyone there is balancing a hefty workload.

Stress is variable. It’s incredibly important IMO to make a solid group of friends to support you through the rough weeks. I highly recommend joining a club or an organization that you’re interested in - it’s a great way to meet people who share an interest. I will say I’m not ChBE or BME so I can’t speak to that degree personally, but from hearing from friends, it is a lot. But it’s a lot for everyone in your classes too, and there’s a really strong network of support for the major. Go to office hours. Go to study sessions. You will get bad grades. You can still get a degree with them.

Housing is like fine. Like it’s not great but it’s a roof and a bed, and campus is great so if you hate it you can find other places to study and spend a lot of your time.

I’m lowkey paranoid about my safety but I can go to a lot of places in midtown on my own during the day and feel perfectly safe. I rode MARTA alone like once and got catcalled but it didn’t progress to anything more than that. Me and a group of friends had a crazy guy tell us about the submarines that we were all gonna live in when Jesus returns one night in midtown, but we weren’t actually very concerned for our safety. Just common sense stuff, let people know where you’re going, don’t be alone at night off campus, look over your shoulder, make sure your shoes are tied.

You have time for a social life. My ChBE friend is insane but she manages decent grades, tutoring, tour guiding, marching band, the band srat, the Chem frat, working out for like an hour a day, and still gets to party on the weekends if she wants. Personally, social life is like meeting up with people to study or eat in the same place during the week, doing club related stuff, and then having decent socializing time on the weekend - maybe doing work in the morning/afternoon on Saturday but then spending the evening with friends, like playing games or taking a run to cookout or going to frat parties.

Unique? It’s a pretty damn good school, but I don’t feel like I’m competing as hard as I would at like MIT. It’s really fun that we have decent sports. Like football hasn’t been great the past few years, but games are fun and we have other great teams if sports are only fun to you if we win. Both our basketball teams went to the NCAA tournament. Baseball is ranked. Our volleyball team is *amazing.* just as a few examples. I love that we aren’t in the middle of nowhere. Campus and campus life have been fulfilling for me, but I love that if I get bored of campus I have an entire city I can go check out. We get discounted tickets once a year to the biggest aquarium in the US. That’s lit. We got free tickets to the Center for Civil and Human Rights. I’ve been meaning to go to the botanical gardens and the High Museum of Art. Piedmont park is around the corner. There’s fun and different restaurants, thrift shops, and markets. There’s hiking pretty close if you’ve got a friend with a car. I don’t think I could’ve gotten all that living in a college town. And like we still have a real deal campus. Beautiful flowers bloom in the spring, there lots of green most of both semester, the leaves on our many trees change in the fall, seasons bro. Good buildings and study places all around the campus too

Unique in a bad way? I mean, I feel like it still has all the bad things of any other college. Sometimes people will suck. Sometimes you’ll feel alone in a room full of people. You’ll get bad grades that you’ll probably cry over. Sometimes you’ll feel pressured to do something, even if no one’s outright pressuring you. You’ll deal with misogyny (yay being a woman). You’ll probably compare yourself to others sometimes and feel down about it. But these are all things that generally come and go, and are honestly just sorta part of life. A good group of friends can help you through it, and if you lack one, make finding a single friend your next goal. We all want friends, so they aren’t that hard to find if you seek them (if it’s not a pandemic).

comments,"&gt; Also does doing Ignite help graduate early as that may help the cost issue?

You've reached the heart of the issue; from a purely monetary perspective, it would only be worth it if Ignite helps you shave an entire semester off of your four years in college (as you pay the same amount for fall/spring semesters regardless of how many credits you take). This is very hard to determine as not only would you already need a four-year plan as a first-year, you'd also need to guarantee that transferring majors, adding on minors, etc. wouldn't significantly impact that plan. Predicting whether you'll be able to save one semester's worth of tuition or not this early on is pretty impractical.

Which means that you should probably determine this based on the other benefits you might get. If you want to get used to campus earlier, make some friends before the fall, have nothing else to do in the summer, etc., it might be worth it.

Oh, girl.  It's because the old geezers who run America don't think that women should have rights.

comments,"Before I answer anything, as many have mentioned already, you hear an overwhelming number of complaints/cry for help because these are the only things people will talk about in a forum like this. No one will be posting about how good their life is or how much they love their 4.0 GPA. This is also not to mention negative posts tend to garner more attention just given that students like to vent and they're more relatable compared to a success story.

With all that being said, let's break it down:

&gt; what is your real opinion of GT? 

I like it, and it's a great fit personally both academically and socially. I'm learning a lot of the things I wanted to learn, and there are countless of clubs and activities I can join to have fun.

&gt; Is it worth it?

From a career perspective, I haven't graduated yet but it's gotten me some decent internship offers, so yes. Socially, absolutely, as I've made great friends here.

&gt; How stressful is it?

To get a solid education, you've gotta work hard for it, and with that there's bound to be some pressure and stress. This is going to vary greatly based on personality and personal habits, but in general, good time management skills will help relieve this a lot. Social events help too. Personally, there's just enough stress to motivate myself but also to not break down.

&gt; Depression rates?

I do personally know people who suffer from depression, though it's hard to say what the exact cause is. I also don't have exact numbers, unfortunately.

&gt; How is housing?

It's alright, I had an alright dorm my first year and I'll be moving off campus.

&gt; How difficult are classes?

Again, with a solid degree comes challenging material you'll need to deal with. Also similarly, with good time management skills, the majority of classes are doable given you allocate enough time for them.

&gt; How is the safety of the city?

Pretty standard compared to any other US city. Don't go out alone, especially not at night, and you should be fine.

&gt; How is the social life?

It's honestly pretty good if you actively seek out for it. Parties every week, tailgates happening throughout campus on game days, countless clubs you can join, etc.

&gt; What are things that make GT unique in a good way?

It's a top-notch STEM school that's also more manageable (and arguably more social) compared to elite schools like MIT, UC Berkeley, etc. I personally love the balance between the solid STEM education I'm getting as well as the social life I still have access to.

&gt; In a bad way?

It is a STEM school after all, so parties might not be as ""crazy"" as schools that don't focus on STEM. Furthermore, the gender ratio is arguably still an issue; it's barely noticeable when you walk on campus, but it will be when you attend some classes.

Overall, though, I do enjoy coming here and don't regret it. It's all up to you though; looks like you already have a lot of great input from this post. Wish you the best.",positive,0.9986,positive,0.19336419753086417,03/29/2021

Being friends with someone for two years and then staying in their bed even when asked to leave - really horrible.

comments,"&gt;Hey I am a current math/CS double major, I didn't have a lot of credits coming in (am international), but I see that you have taken a lot of the upper level courses in the math curriculum. If you have a lot of credits coming in I would lean towards recommending the double major. If you are worried about thread restrictions, you don't really have to worry since I think doing a double major in math and cs and picking the right courses in math will allow to you basically take the theory and mod-sim threads as a byproduct (this won't be officially on your transcript, but it doesn't really matter since you took all of the necessary classes). I was originally intelligence and mod-sim, but I changed to info-internetworks to double major, but since I took diffeq and will take numerial analysis, I basically took the mod-sim thread anyway. And like the other comments mentioned, you should definitely do more outside of the classroom for a better undergraduate experience, your math background will help you a lot in cs or math research, and having that cs background should open doors for a lot of different internships. If you are interested in quant roles in particular, I think there is a fintech lab at GT, you could try reaching out to the professor there if you want to research there. I also would definitely recommend taking graduate level courses in place of undergraduate courses if you feel like you've already learned the material. The hardest part about double majoring imo is schedulling classes properly to get the requirements met and to take the classes I want, I would definitely talk to an advisor about this. But if you are unsure, I would start off with the CS major and get a feel for what they are like, you can always add the double major later down in you college career.",positive,0.9918,positive,0.07793410293410294,03/29/2021

comments,"I agree with this, as someone who was also once a CHBE here. And I will say that I've seen my BME comrades generally have a less stressful time, and almost always had great social lives. With CHBE your social life depends on what you can give it, and of course, it's up to you how you want to balance your time. That depends on your personal preferences and your career goals, imo.

I'll add another two cents based on the questions OP had:

What is your real opinion of GT?  
It's tough, And I'm SO glad to be out, but I'm also SO glad I was here. While I was here, life was actually kinda nice. It was stressful with classes but as another poster below mentioned, always cushion harder classes with easier ones, and figure out your ideal courseload early on (the tradeoff is taking longer to graduate usually). I felt good though because I had great friends that I could study with and also take breaks from studying with by going out. In general, I don't regret a thing about my time at GT.

Is it worth it?  
From a CHBE perspective, YES. Because so many companies are aware of the value of this degree, and as long as you intern you can relatively easily get a job. As far as being a women, it's getting better in a lot of the big companies. Engineering is a male-dominated field though, so you'll have to deal with occasional idiots no matter which school or company you eventually go to. Just keep this in mind. Plus, the faculty of both departments in CHBE and BME are professionally supportive and I've personally never had a problem with any of them. Sometimes CHBE profs have a knack for not remembering that you're a human with other responsibilities besides their classes, but that's another story for another day.

How stressful is it?  
Again, quite major-dependent and what-you-decide-to-take-on-dependent. Just by the content of classes, it can be tough, but it's all very doable. As the post I'm responding to says, I agree. If you can be dissuaded on the basis of other people's experiences with stress, then GT may not be the school for you, because many students like to complain (even when they're doing great, believe me!) and I think that's just a college student thing. I will admit though that at times we have this toxic ""I'm the most stressed"" competition at times. Same thing with losing sleep. Don't fall into that, please. I think sometimes people want recognition for the difficulty of what they do at this school, and that's fine, but we need to learn to do it in a healthier way than trying to diminish others' stress. I think as a student culture though, it's something that we're working on.

Depression rates?  
I do think it's higher here than the US average. Here's a good page from the Mental Health Initiative that's been started over the past couple years: [https://healthinitiatives.gatech.edu/spring-2018-mental-health-well-being-population-data](https://healthinitiatives.gatech.edu/spring-2018-mental-health-well-being-population-data)While I think GT's history is bad, again, I think as an institution, it's working toward being better, even if that doesn't seem like enough soon enough. I'll leave that out there for you all to judge!

How is housing?  
Housing on campus is alright. I'd recommend you come visit the campus to see if you like what it looks like. GT itself is a beautiful campus though, and the facilities are beautiful too. You also have lots of apartment options in Atlanta, although it is medium to high level expensive, if that floats your boat.

How difficult are classes?  
Early on, it is usually all difficult, but then it becomes major-dependent. I think that it also seems that there's this phenomena in engineering classes where upper level courses feel less weed-out-y and more just ""show us what you know now"", so in that sense it feels easier later in your major from an engineering perspective. Also, this would only go if you thrive in project and lab settings (the opposite would be true if you don't).

How is the safety of the city?  
I'd say it's alright in midtown. Keep your wits about you. Walking around at daytime is usually not even something to sweat about (except because of Atlanta's hot summers). I'd still be aware of my surroundings though. At night, be much more cautious in general. Avoid the more shady parts of town. I'm an Atlanta native, and I feel like I betray my city when I say this, but it's true, especially for those who don't know how to navigate around Atlanta.

How is the social life?  
Again, what you make of it.

What are things that make GT unique in a good way?  
GT is unique in that it's a public institution at the top of many engineering rankings. It also is really REALLY well recognized in the Atlanta area even if you're not in engineering. People know about its rigor generally. That's kind of a good segue into the bad. I think it's also known for how stressful it is, and also fuck PTS. Jk, I can be the bigger woman now that I'm out, but damn. Y'all always stealin my parkin spots, never sending buses on time.

comments,"Current BME here. Tech is stressful. They’re going to make you work hard here, it’s very high ranked for BME for a reason. Whoever said “tech is a pressure cooker” put it well I think lol. Classes are hard, you generally get anywhere between 2-5 exams/midterms a semester per class, so you’ve gotta be diligent. Comparing my classes to my friends, it seems like ours are **hard** hard. For example, one of my friends took Matlab at their school and covered about half the content we do. Also, as a BME you either need to be premed, get a minor, or get a certificate (which is kinda like a Minor LITE). But it’s just hard, not impossible. If you make a good routine and stay on top of your work you should be all right. If you’re struggling, there are lots of resources including TA and Prof office hours, PLUS (extra practice) sessions, tutoring, studios, and certain classes have “help desks”.

Like. Class work as an engineer is hard, but doing it successfully is so rewarding. And the harder the question the more accomplished you feel when you succeed. And you try to build something or do a project and it *works* and you get to feel like you really took steps towards becoming an engineer. And personally, I think that makes it worth it. 

I couldn’t tell you about depression rates honestly, I don’t know where to find those stats. 

I’m gonna say that GT housing (the department) is a bitch. The housing itself isn’t the worst - some places are better than others but I think I lived in one of the shittiest freshman dorms available and it wasn’t really *that* bad. Now I live in much better upperclassmen housing, and I’m probably going to continue living on campus because my room now is pretty comfortable. Some things here and there bug you a bit and you won’t be living in luxury but it’s not that bad. The housing department sucks though, their first priority absolutely seems to be getting you to commit to paying housing for a year. and maintenance takes forever to show up. By way of the city, idk it’s about as safe as any large-ish city I think. You shouldn’t go alone after dark, have basic awareness when moving around, and there are some streets you should definitely avoid. But I honestly feel completely safe on campus. My freshman year people would go to the bathroom while leaving their laptops out on the dining hall (I strongly don’t recommend doing this btw, it feels like tempting fate. But people still felt safe enough to do it).

Overall I really like the GT community. It’s incredibly collaborative rather than competitive. Sometimes you visit a school and it feels like they might shank you for a curve. One of my friends had someone tell the group chat fake info about what would be on an exam at her school so the overall would be lower. Georgia Tech is **not** like that. We’re all in this together, we all (generally) want to see each other get through this. When you’re struggling people will clamor over each other to help you out. In my first semester hear I mentioned offhandedly in my English class about how I didn’t understand a certain topic in my math class and three separate people offered to explain it to me after class.

Also, I love the bme program. I’ve loved most of the classes I’ve taken so far. I would say *most* of the required classes are totally understandable as to why you’re taking them, and the advisors are great (love Paul. What a guy. Legitimately great dude). Professors have generally been helpful and understanding so far. I’ve loved the projects I’ve had to do.

**tl;dr Tech is hard and being stressful comes with that. but everyone has your back. If you’re willing to work hard then I think you’d do well here**",positive,0.9982,positive,0.15617293528981846,03/29/2021

By that do you mean literally zero experience, or have you had some very minimal experience? If it's the former, that really doesn't sound like a good idea. If it's the latter, try out the [Spanish placement test](https://modlangs.gatech.edu/students/placement-tests) and see how you do.

GT vs private universities is a tough decision and I don't know your situation, so I can't say for sure whether it is worth it. Would you prefer a larger school with lots of great engineering research or a smaller one that could have more individualized attention or a different student culture? Which has better name recognition? GT's name recognition/reputation is very strong in the engineering world! Probably the only private schools that are stronger there are MIT and Stanford (maybe also Cornell, Columbia, or someone else I forgot). But of course some other private schools may have more name recognition to the average non-STEM person. Which one is better on your finances? Overall, GT is a very nice school to go to for engineering.

Housing at GT is alright, maybe a bit expensive. After your freshman year you get apartment-style housing which is nice. There are multiple ways to get social life: I have gotten friends primarily through my major but also through a club (sadly lost somewhat with coronavirus). Atlanta has some sketchy parts but when you are on campus it is very safe. If you don't live too far away now and can make it here, I encourage you to visit our campus- it is very nice, perhaps better than you'd expect for being in a city.

I am glad that I chose this school. It has good academics, I've made friends, and while I have worked harder than in high school by a lot, I have been able to handle the classes alright.",positive,0.9964,positive,0.1947669880624426,03/29/2021

comments,"Nah m8, the reason why we couldn't say oh look at all the blacks doing x and y is because there is a specific history of those types of conversations being much more than descriptive in nature. For example if I read in a textbook ""The Japanese committed one of the greatest atrocities known to date, The Rape of Nanking"" I wouldn't assume that the author had some malicious intent in the statement. Obviously not every Japanese citizen was complicit in this atrocity, but in the context of whatever is discussed in that textbook it would be obvious they are singling out the officers and service men who allowed this to happen. Language is just like that, sometimes we forgo the formality of singling out what specific group we're discussing so we can put our intention/purpose on display.

***After getting a COVID-19 vaccine, will I test positive for COVID-19 on a viral test?***

**No.** Neither the recently authorized and recommended  vaccines nor the other COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials in  the United States can cause you to test positive on [viral tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html), which are used to see if you have a **current infection**.​

If your body develops an immune response—the goal of vaccination—there is a possibility you may test positive on some [antibody tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html). Antibody tests indicate you had a **previous infection** and  that you may have some level of protection against the virus.

Professor Willard E. Wight taught Civil War History at GT my first quarter in the Fall of 1978. After he closed the doors to the lecture hall in the DM Smith building that was filled to capacity he started with this or WTTE:

""My name is Professor Willard E. Wight. Some of you may have heard me being referred to as Bastard Wight. I am not just a shaft, but a shaft with purple rotating barbs."" There were other words that followed those, but those are the ones still stuck in my head.

I watched as something like half the lecture hall left, presumably to drop the class. Like an idiot, I sat there. Tests were all essay-style in those stupid little blue notebooks using the tiny pencils he handed out at each test. Essay questions were on the most arcane civil war history points, a lot of them involving the theological conviction of the southern soldiers, and I am an atheist, so: fish in a desert sand dune at noon.

Would anyone who's taken either of the two classes care to chime in and let me know more about each of them? Or anyone in the same dilemma as me want to share their plan?

This was also the professor who (for a different class - vehicle performance) had allowed people to question their grades with him on tests in office hours, so while I was waiting in line for my turn the kid in front of me was saying ""it was just one mistake in the beginning that carried through and made everything in the problem off - why can't I get partial credit?""

The professor replied ""if you made this same mistake on a plane design, it would have crashed. Would you care about partial credit then?""

You getting into Tech means that you have the capabilities to succeed here. However, Tech is a much harder school than most schools out there. Therefore, you should learn to adapt to it.

These are some of my recommendations for future semesters: 

Learn what your comfortable course load is (4 classes, 5 classes etc.)

Try not to take all the major classes all together. (try 3 major classes + 2 extra classes)

Try to get into classes which has a more lenient grade distribution. Ask your peers or use course critique to find this.

Try to get into classes together with your friends. You could form study groups which is a huge help.

comments,"I am at GT for my Ph.D. and am very happy here. I have zero regrets about choosing it. That being said I am happy I did not go here for my undergraduate degree. Here are a few things to consider:

1. Atlanta is not a college town. As a graduate student who already had a master's degree coming in this was a huge bonus but as an undergraduate, it was nice to live in a town that centered around the university.
2. Tech is very focused when it comes to classes you will have very limited options outside of STEM. Going into my undergraduate degree this didn't matter to me at all. I didn't care about taking classes outside the college of engineering. That being said one of my biggest regrets from my undergraduate was not taking enough classes outside my college. This is because as much as you may know that you want to be in a certain field if you don't explore enough to really be able to establish what is and isn't for you at some point you will likely question if you chose the right field and you will have no data points one way or another to say. Most people I know that were hyper-focused have gone through this in their mid to late twenties.
3. Most people at Tech are in STEM this is awesome in some regards but it brings a certain mentality. Tech is full of high-achieving perfectionists. Sometimes it is nice to get away from that. At Tech it is nearly impossible. The closest I have found is maybe the business school. At my undergraduate, I had so many options to take classes in other colleges where the culture was much more laid back. Don't underestimate that reprieve. This is also helpful in providing some perspective when you are feeling really stupid because of your engineering classes.
4. If you have aspirations of going to graduate school Tech may be a hindrance. If you get a low GPA here(anything below a 3.5. Note that this is not low by Tech standards)  you may have problems getting into the programs you want or getting the funding you want. Tech may hand out lower grades than a lot of other places and wear it as a badge of honor about how difficult the university is but other places won't acknowledge that. All they will see is the low GPA. This would mean that you would likely need to complete a Master's here to get a reasonable GPA.
5. Additionally, there are jobs that have a hard GPA cut off generally around 3.5 and your application will not see the light of day if you are below it. Most people coming into tech were top of their class and could not imaging having a GPA below 3.5 so don't make the mistake of thinking that you would never be that person.
6. Tech is an excellent school. If the BS is the last degree you plan on ever getting then there are few places that are better. There are lots of opportunities to get involved in cool research projects, it is internationally recognized so if you want to work abroad after graduating that is a huge plus, and you will get a thorough undergraduate education in your chosen field.
7. If you plan on going to graduate school then know that no one will care where you did your undergrad as long as it is accredited. Pick a university and major that you think you will enjoy. I went to a good engineering school in my state and did my BS/MS in ME knowing I wanted to eventually do a Ph.D. in AE. The slight major switch did not matter one bit although I was involved in many AE research projects in my undergrad and masters so that did help.
8. Safety: There are safer places to go to school but generally as long as you are home by 9pm or traveling with a group you will be fine. If you want to feel safe walking alone at 10 or 11pm pick a college town. Although I should note that most towns have a cut-off where you just don't want to be out on your own for the town I lived in for my undergrad it was around 11:30.

One thing to consider is there have been a lot of move-in specials because of new apartments around campus these can significantly lower your effective monthly rate for your first year but you may have to consider moving after that.

As to where to look I looked all over midtown is perhaps safer than west midtown although these days the difference is pretty marginal as west midtown has developed a lot. the areas directly north and south of campus are a lot less safe but potentially cheaper so that is a priority thing. Also know that apartment hunting here takes time. Most apartments will not show as available until 30-60 days before the move-in date.

comments,I am going to second the fact that you need to contact professors. In graduate programs in the US the admissions department has very little control/say over funding. Funding is mostly determined by the professors themselves and to a lesser extent the department. If you want a funded Ph.D. you need to look through all the professors and their research areas. Read at least the abstracts of a few papers they have written. From there find the top 3 professors that you like and reach out to them. I would highly suggest getting on the phone with them to get a feel for how they view the PhD process and what it is like working in their lab. See if you can talk to a student or two in their lab. If you decide that you still like them after talking to them and possibly a student from their lab ask them if they are accepting graduate students and how funding works in their lab. Not all labs will have openings every year and some would love to have you but may not be able to fund you so once you work your way through those three if you don't have any hits you can continue your way down your preference list until you find the right fit.,positive,0.9042,positive,0.13902919501133784,03/29/2021

comments,"Take a look at the actual standings info:  [https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/academic-standing](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/academic-standing)

A student is still in good standing (no probation, no warning, or anything)  with a 2.0 as a senior (1.95 as a junior).  You currently have a 2.5 after two semesters, so assuming you are taking about the same load each semester, you could get around a 1.0 this semester and still be in good standing.

If you do drop below that 2.0 overall, you are likely to have a semester on warning or probation before hitting drop status.

So, stop worrying about what you can't control, and just focus on doing the best you can to finish up the semester.

Maybe drop your load a little next semester.  Assuming all those grades you listed were 3 hour classes, you were taking 18 hours then.  Try dropping down to 12 or 15.   Get your feet under you, and build the GPA up, so you have more  wiggle room.

If talking to the adviser or dean will help you feel more comfortable with these facts, feel free to reach out, but I don't think you're nearly as sunk as you think you are.

Even if they do put you on warning or probation, the big impact is that they force you to take my advice and drop your load a little next semester.",negative,-0.4835,positive,0.15097222222222223,03/29/2021

The real question here is what do you want to do with your degree? once you know that look around campus and see what activities you could join that are related to that. Look for competition teams, professors doing research, student groups, etc. There has to be a group on campus doing something related to whatever you want to use your degree for. You may have to work for free but the experience will be invaluable and in my experience, a lot of professors save some money to pay students who do well on their projects. You just have to start out working for free.

comments,"Since this happened \~1989 or so, it wouldn't have been a selfie, but still a great story. A former co-worker of mine visited us in AZ. I told him he \*had\* to see the Grand Canyon. It was a great trip, and we spent a few hours up there before driving back.

On the way back, we stopped at another scenic overlook where he asked me to take some pictures of him near the edge of a cliff. He posed for a few, then sat down on the edge with his feet dangling over the edge. Less than a minute later, he lay down on his back, rolled over, and Army-crawled toward me before standing up and finished walking toward me. When I asked him WTF, he said he was kind of swinging/kicking his legs and realized that his feet hit nothing; he was sitting on an overhang and he couldn't tell how far back the cliff went, so he freaked out a little bit. That still gives me goose bumps thinking about it.

comments,"What class is this for? I can't imagine you've gotten even a faculty member to sign off on putting this out like this, even for a class project. While anonymous surveys are normal in class projects, this touches on a very sensitive subject and, to be frank, needs to be handled more carefully than this.

Making promises to keep the data confidential from a pseudonymous reddit account is insufficient for obtaining informed consent and disclosing data handling and storage procedures and anonymization, especially when you're asking people to potentially tie their real life identities to their responses. There is a reason why the IRB approved consent forms on real studies go over this stuff and provide points of contact for participants (a reddit account doesn't count).

Furthermore, this survey presents all question categories to everyone, regardless of their earlier answers. I can imagine survivors of sexual assault would find it distressing to be suddenly presented with questions aimed at their attacker after being promised that the survey was a safe place for them to discuss their experience. Even Google Forms has the ability to conditionally display pages/questions based on prior answers, so to see no attempt made to utilize them is rather appalling. If you need more control, use something more scientific like Qualtrics, rather than putting your participants in a very compromising situation.

I don't believe you have any ill intent here, but they're are serious issues with conducting this kind of research, which makes going through the proper methods and safeguards vital. At the very least, this needs to be run past an experienced faculty member, as running surveys this sensitive without IRB approval is rather dangerous.

comments,"Alright listen up buckaroo.

I double majored at this school. I TAed something like 6 different classes in my undergraduate time at this school, all the way from intro classes to capstone. I have been a part of, and taken classes across 4 different departments (and I mean high level classes, I'm not talking shit like inta 1200). I graduated with highest honors.

There have been exactly two classes that still infuriate me, years after taking them. They are ECE 3043 and 2031. 3043 has a myriad of problems, but at it's core, I think it's salvageable.

2031 is hands down, the most bullshit class I've ever taken. Kevin, when you read this in the morning, if you haven't already gone through this thread, you get this feedback every semester. Every semester, the students point out the problems with the class. The fact that lab quizzes are 3% of your grade each. The fact that there is zero accountability in the group project. The fact that more emphasis is put on inane readings or vague ""communication"" instructions than on learning the course materials. 2031 managed to kill any remaining interest I had in digital design. And don't tell me that the ""communication"" requirements make any sense. I understand ABET accreditation, I understand the theory. I also have written several publications. I know that there is no ""standard"" that's consistent across all academia and industry the way the instructors of 2031 repeatedly tell you. The instructors of 2031 get this feedback every single semester. Every single semester they ignore it, and go the next one, open the class with that smug speech about 2031, and the cycle repeats.

You are full of bullshit. ""Hardest postsecondary institution in the south"" my ass. Bullshit does not mean hard. Information theory is hard. Control theory is hard. 2031 is a massive waste of time, but it's not hard. The instructors being unwilling to adapt to changing circumstances does not ""build character"" or ""prepare us for the real world."" I actively lost knowledge while taking 2031. If there was a single class I could remove from the ECE curriculum in it's current form, it would be 2031.",negative,-0.9878,neutral,-0.0025352022529441915,03/30/2021

However, if a student does add the class after some lessons have taken place, it's their responsibility to find out what they missed, just as if they'd missed any other lesson. Adding the class after classes have begun effectively counts the same as an excused absence, and the student and instructor must find an agreeable solution to let the student make up the work.

comments,"What I don't understand is why the TAs for this course put so much effort to make it 95% remote, and then ask OOS students to get an accommodation for the last 5%.

Like, why go through all the work to:

* Put together detailed parts lists so students can have an entire workbench at home
* Streamline the online lab checkoff process, patiently putting up with all my bullshit of waiting until Friday/Sat morning to do all my checkoffs at once
* Quickly answer Piazza questions (even if many of the instructor responses begin with dIdYoU rEaD tHe PrElAb)

And then to *not* continue that effort to the last 5% of the class which is the oscilloscope lab?

Like, this class has a *custom-developed* FERPA-compliant website that integrates with our GT logins. It might have some outdated info, but it took a lot of effort to make. The head TA even made high-quality renders of some of the breadboard setups. Like, that's an insane amount of effort to make the class work well online. Why not finish the job with the oscilloscope lab?

FWIW I took this class last semester when the oscilloscope lab (switch bounce) was optional. Even then, I made my own oscilloscope for the final project, since it was in the audio range I just used a voltage divider to connect the speaker voltage to my soundcard mic input ([like seen here](https://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/turn-your-computers-sound-card-into-a-scope)). Now this is kinda risky (could have fried my soundcard), but it works great for up to 41kHz samples. 

Unfortunately, detecting switch bounce requires more sophisticated oscilloscopes with millions of samples per second, and would be expensive to buy. But the TAs could have designed a lab analyzing *slower* analog waveforms that could be sampled by cheap USB soundcards, which they could have added to the partslist. The whole point of the lab is just to teach students how to set the zoom level, how to set rising/falling edge triggers, how to move cursors around to measure the duty cycle, etc. There are plenty of PC software that can do this with your mic input/soundcard -- I used [xoscope](http://www-mdp.eng.cam.ac.uk/web/CD/engapps/xoscope/xoscope.pdf) because I'm on linux, but there are plenty of alternative software that can be good teaching tools.

That way, instead of *excluding* OOS ppl from the lab activity, you can *include* them in the ""fun"" and they get to learn how to use an oscilloscope so they are ready when they return to campus this Fall!

Most graduate with decent job offers, yes. GT also has solid career connections, so definitely go to career fairs and network as much as possible.

&gt; Also, if I want to get internships during the summer you think I would have to stay in Atlanta, cause I am out of state so I want to be able to go back home during summers but still intern at some nice companies to build my resume.

I think you're misunderstanding how internships work a little bit. You're not limited to internships in Atlanta at all; I was going to be in North Carolina last summer before my offer got cancelled, and I was going to be in California this upcoming summer until my internship turned remote.

Then they get a professorship and they're expected to keep doing that research at or above the same level for several years or they lose their job - oh and also teach these classes, do a bunch of work for the department, and don't forget to bring in those grant dollars and write papers, but MORE!

comments,"Sorry to hear things have been stressful.  A few things:

1. There's no excuse for a hostile attitude.
2. Having an assignment due before add/drop to me is a nice thing to do, because you can help people get some insight into whether this class is for them.  IFF you accept the assignment late/no penalty for people who added the course late.
3. If the course is remote, they can't make you come in. If the course mode is hybrid, making you come in is appropriate.  In fact if the course mode is hybrid, not having any requirement to come in would be unethical because some poor soul came to campus just to be present for a hybrid class and we can't have them saying ""@#$@--I could've stayed home.""  (Good news: hybrid mode is dead--fall will be mostly f2f, some remote, no hybrid.)
4. Faculty are people.  There are brave souls who are trying to parent tiny kids with no childcare.  People who are depressed, or panicked because they haven't gotten much research done this year (and there's a ton of pressure on faculty).  Make a list of the pandemic stresses on students-- those things affect us too.

Don't forget that you have a voice.  If something is not right, it's best to start by talking with the faculty member directly.  Talk to them over video or in person--not email--and explain your concerns. If that doesn't help, you can reach out to the department chair, the dean of student's office, or use the formal academic grievance process.

That's the only class I've ever written to the dean (and subsequently been called in for a quick meeting to talk to them) to complain about how bad the professor was.  In our case, he was supposed to be splitting time between Savannah and Atlanta campuses, but spent all but one week in Savannah.  Showed up well past 15 minutes late consistently, and was a complete no-show on quite a few occasions.  Mumbled through his slides without pause, wouldn't repeat or clarify anything, ignored questions asked through the remote connection, actually CLAIMED to be drinking vodka from his thermos and certainly acted incoherent enough for that to be plausible.

Scraped a C.  The fact that I passed and wasn't asking for a higher grade seemed to surprise the dean and make them take my complaints seriously.

comments,"Yeah honestly if there's a test that has extremely low averages, that's usually on the professor. The worst test I ever took had an average of about 30%. The main reason was that five out of the six questions on the test were written by the TA, who was basically uninvolved in the class (there was no graded homework). So he just threw a bunch of random questions on there that were tangentially related to what had been covered in class. The professor looked at that test, realized that the test didn't cover what he wanted, and decided to add a sixth question to the test. So we ended up with a test that a)nobody knew how to do and b)was impossible to finish on time.",negative,-0.7713,negative,-0.19999999999999998,03/30/2021

We’re still amidst a pandemic and our covid cases per day are identical to last fall semester in Fulton county and having to fit multiple students in the same space with zero ideas on their covid-related habits makes me uncomfortable (especially with how ambivalent a lot of other GaTech students have been with Covid).

Back when Drownproofing was still a graduation requirement, it was scheduled in the first quarter of my freshman year in 1978.

They had to drag the guy who was alphabetically before me out of the pool during the ""two lengths of the pool underwater"" swim and resuscitate him. When the instructor called my name next, I just went ""nope, not today"" and walked out of class. I eventually did enough in that course to get a (IIRC) 53, which was the best D that I ever got in any class at GT. After that, when people approached me with petitions to remove Drownproofing as a graduation requirement, I just told them ""I had to do that, so you are going to have to do it as well"".

comments,"I’m going to add my 2 cents in here mainly because it needs to be said. I am a 3rd year EE graduating next semester with highest honors and in under 4 years. I say this only in response to the “wheat from the chaff” comment below. 

I got an A in 2031 but found the whole class to be very very off putting. I did fine in the prelab quizzes but agree they shouldn’t be weighted so heavily. What drove me up a wall was the attitude of the instructors. The lead instructor does minimal instruction but the two of them are some of the rudest, most condescending people in all of ECE. The co-teacher of the class must be a practicing stoic- it just comes off as rude.

For everyone else who isn’t ECE, these two are not reflective of the department- I have had some absolutely fantastic instructors here and most are very nice to work with. 

Back when I took the class, pre-covid, we were using DE2 boards and they constantly had problems. I would bring this to the attention of the TAs who I presume would let others know, but it never got fixed. I would just end up pillaging a DE2 from another desk and hooking it up to my setup and it worked. 

My GTA was terrible, and the anecdotes we’ve heard so far about the “communication” aspect of the course are 100% correct. The guidelines from the GTA are vague and the formatting requirements silly. The GTA grades your lab report, marks of 10 points for the caption not being concise enough or some other subjective BS or one time argued with me that I called the scope probe calibration terminal (the one with the square wave) the wrong thing until I showed him what the scope manual called it. 

My project team was great, but I can’t imagine ending up with dead weight and trying to hold those team members accountable- there would be no way to do so.

The professors didn't treat us as children, they treated us as coworkers. IIRC, the assignments due before drop date weren't exactly difficult, and being a required class the number of transient students shouldn't be insurmountable.

The Profs are short when communicating in text, but speaking to them in person was always wonderful. Kevin was hilarious (Heck, dude makes straight-up S-teir memes about the class like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf13Kf01An0)), and Prof Collins (who was the main prof when I took it) was serious but incredibly kind. I recall a test I had to take late due to another event and he was extremely flexible in scheduling a time for me to come take the test near his office.

comments,"Good question! Solid fuel typically lends itself to much simpler rocket designs, as the solid propellants only need to be ignited and it will provide thrust to the rocket (although this is a simplification).

Liquid fuel rockets provide much more flexibility and a little more efficiency at the cost of increased complexity. You can turn a liquid fuel engine on/off and throttle it down as needed, but you can't do this with solid fuel (which just burns continuously until fuel is depleted). However, this comes with the need to design an entire custom plumbing system with tubes, valves, pumps (sometimes), and complex electronics to safely deliver and monitor propellants from the tanks to the engine at controlled flowrates and temperatures.  In the video, ours is to the left of our engine (but not shown), and the stand holding it is even bigger than the stand holding the engine.

comments,"I think other people have good advice. For dealing short term with burnout:

1. Prioritize getting enough sleep, do some kind of exercise (like 30 min walk), try to eat relatively well (like real food, not snacks), spend a little time socializing each day -- i.e. take care of basics of mental health.
2. Make a prioritized to do list--for me, I make a list daily, and it takes conscious effort to make sure I've considered what NEEDS to happen this day. It's also helpful to map out once a week what NEEDS to happen each upcoming day. Don't go overboard, but it's helpful to think about ""subtasks"" so if it's ""study for quiz"" maybe write down ""do 1 practice quiz"" or ""make flashcards"" or w/e.

Once you have your mental health basics and the to do list planned out, then all you worry about is doing the stuff on the list. Focus on doing the steps, not emotions about the tasks if possible (like feeling bad that you aren't grasping concepts faster or something). Basically, give yourself a break from beating yourself up about your results, and just focus on actions currently. I find this mentally much more bearable than worrying about what my grades are.

Hope this helps! When you make it thru this semester, then spend time thinking about what could be different set up in future like smaller class load.",positive,0.7092,positive,0.05031565656565656,03/30/2021

You're exactly right - we are running tests to measure not only thrust, but also how well we can control our propellant flow rates and temperatures as they get delivered to the engine.

This is our first-generation engine, capable of only burning for about 2.5 seconds. Because the burn time was so short, a vehicle with this engine likely wouldn't have gone very high (maybe a few hundred feet?). This test is paving the way for our second-generation regeneratively cooled engine, which we'll use on our first liquid-fuel rocket called Subscale.

Asking for due dates to be pushed back the night they are due is another.    
I think most professors care about mental health but they don't want to make classes easier because they still want students to learn the material. It's difficult to find the balance between throwing out too much content and making students' lives harder than it needs to be.  
This also may vary from department to department, because different departments have different policies and practices for handling this sort of stuff.

As a guy, I can't fully speak to women's experiences in a way that does them justice, but I will say that virtually anyone who's reasonably close friends with women as an adult will tell you that there's a tragically high chance they've described experiences, having happened to them and/or people they know, that range from the frustrating/inappropriate to the horrific.

The prof that got to me the most was constantly bringing up gender in class. His comment I still remember the most was about how the females in the class don’t participate enough and seeing as how participation was part of our grade he then required the rest of the questions for the semester be answered alternatively by males and females. This in a class with two women now responsible for answering 50% of his questions every lecture. Plenty of guys sat silently in that room all semester as apparently the prof could tell most of them apart from each other since they weren’t women. It truly demonstrated how much harder we had to work to prove to him that we deserved to be in his class. 

Another prof didn’t want to write me a letter of recommendation but then said that since I got an A in his class he guessed he had to write it. 

Unfortunately as others have mentioned, it doesn’t stop after graduation. Almost a decade later and I still have guys at the office who didn’t get into GT telling me that I only got in because I’m a female and they only got declined because they’re a guy as they’re confident they had at least the same high school resume as me.

•Why is undergrad so divisive?

•Why is grad NOT divisive? 

•How could we break down the results further? gender —&gt; race, ethnicity, instate/OOS/international, major, year, etc.

•Was the question unbiased enough?

•If we reached a larger population of the student body would the answers change?

comments,"Hi!

I'm a girl from India and I got admitted to GeorgiaTech for aerospace engineering. I'm a prospective first-year starting in fall 2021. I just had a few questions before I commit to gatech in the new week or so.

1. How easy is it for an Indian citizen to get internships and co-ops in aerospace firms? Can I realistically expect such opportunities to come my way, or will I just have to wait endlessly while my peers bag the best internships?
2. As an aerospace major, can I attend Mechanical engineering career fairs to see if i can find internships there? (My point is that I don't wanna be sulking about not getting an internship in Aero, so can I intern in other engineering fields since the basic skillsets are quite similar? Also, how helpful is the university in finding appropriate opportunities for each person, especially given that my case is a little extra challenging?)
3. How is the gender ratio in aero engineering classes? I read a few reddit posts about girls feeling very objectified in engineering classes. Is that usually the case? Do girls feel included in the class environment because I read a post that said girls are not taken seriously/ they get hit on all the time.
4. How is the social life at tech? Are there parties on campus? Are people generally sociable? I've heard people are very cliquey and sometimes socially awkward. Is that true? I won't be attending the summer IGNITE program, and from what I've read on reddit, the living learning communities are also pretty useless. I'll be doing the first-year experience, but is that enough to make strong friendships? Or will the people from these programs already have formed their cliques?
5. What are the best dorms in terms of atmosphere and friendliness? I know that glenn and towers are the best dorms but I read somewhere that people on the same floor don't talk or they're very snobbish in these dorms. Also I haven't applied for housing yet so i probably wont get glenn/towers.",positive,0.9901,positive,0.13004261363636366,03/31/2021

It is effectively zero. The tragedies are impactful because of how quickly they happen and the innocent lives they often take but in terms of threat to society are quite small. Maybe a better way to say it is that your risk of losing yourself or a dear friend *right now* due to their isolation and deteriorating MH is higher and more pertinent issue to worry about.

Nonetheless, next semester will certainly be a period of acclimation for the campus and a huge sigh of relief for most. I expect hostility to go way down as we get to talk in-person once again, but everyone please be on the lookout for those having a hard time getting back into the grove (im talking about you, rising sophomores who have never set foot on campus).

However, there is a pretty good global program and there may be other methods of getting internships, though it will definitely feel more restricted than our peers who are US citizens. 
For social life, the school is big enough that I think everyone can find their own crowd, some people who come to tech with friends from high school may be more cliquey but in general it's just about finding clubs where you're comfortable and being open.

comments,"In 1554 currently. All the sections share one piazza and schedule and you're free to use another prof's resources, so it shouldn't matter that much which one you get. It's a lot of work though. I wouldn't say it's the hardest math necessarily, but there is pretty much a test or quiz every other week. And since you're taking it for the summer the pace may be even faster. If you're not doing anything else besides those 2 classes, it could be doable, but I'd advise against it if you're also holding down a job or internship. Basically what I have to do to prep before every test/quiz is neglect all my other classwork and do a bunch of practice problems in order to get that A. 

They do release practice exams from previous years though so those are also pretty helpful. In fact you can check out all the course material here: [https://people.math.gatech.edu/\~sbarone7/ma1554s21.html](https://people.math.gatech.edu/~sbarone7/ma1554s21.html).

comments,"&gt;As for the study sessions and flirting, I just think that is how guys are.

Yeah, that's the problem?? Those guys could make more of an effort to, you know, **not** be that way.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Would a group of girls invite a guy to a study session? No.

1. What? This isn't middle school. None of us has cooties, study sessions aren't ""no boys allowed"" zones - unless you're focused on pursuits other than passing exams. (See above.)
2. Do you think we have much choice? Have you seen the ratio at this school?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;While the professor's compliment is not exactly inappropriate

It is. It is inappropriate.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Obviously, the harassment is a serious problem, but nobody, regardless of gender, should be out at night.

There are so many things to unpack with this sentence. First, it's blatant victim blaming. Second, this sentence ignores the many circumstances other than being out at night that more frequently lead to harassment and assault. For instance, a friend you thought you could trust betraying that trust when you're at your most vulnerable. (This is an experience I've seen echoed by many woman in this thread.) Third, it ignores the *significant* difference between going out at night as a woman and going out at night as a man. Sure, when it can be avoided, it's probably best for anyone not to be out at night. But, it is a hell of a lot more of a risk for a woman to be out at night than a man, largely because there are so many predators out there that see a woman on the street and feel entitled to talk to her or touch her or follow her, and they never face consequences for their shit.",negative,-0.9737,positive,0.1724426807760141,03/31/2021

Of course every man (and woman, for that matter) has some level of misogyny ingrained into them, and I don't expect any man to be a perfect feminist, but the difference between men who support women and men who only think they do is how receptive they are to feedback when they've said or done something ignorant.

What bothers me more than your misguided take here is the way that you've responded to all the people who have called you out for it. Clearly your comment is unpopular, which should have given you some indication that you were in the wrong, but, rather than reflect on that, you've only dug in further and responded defensively.

I said you're not an exception \[to misogyny\] because I haven't seen you holding yourself accountable. I believe in your desire to support the women in your life, but I just don't see how you can do that without listening first.

I do apologize for my heated tone. I'm not trying to make an enemy of you here; in fact, I'm trying to do the opposite.
