It makes it super easy to meet people on your floor and hang out with them without all the initial awkwardness.

As for specific housing options, Glenn and Towers are the nicest (it’s been a few years since I’ve kept up with this so other dorms may be renovated now) but they were completely gutted and redone. If you took a campus tour you were likely shown either of those dorms since they’re so nice. As for west campus I’m not really sure what’s best.

E.g., I was a math major at my college and when I transferred, absolutely none of my previous 60 credit hours counted in the computation of my GPA. That included all of the easier courses that pad your GPA, such as English, Calc 1-3, physics, and chem.

What that means is that, when compared to the GPA of my peers, mine was obviously lower because only hard courses like applied number theory or differential geometry were used in the computation.

Fast forward 5 years, nobody gives a shit about GPA on the employment side. I’ve never been asked, and in the limited cases where it is required on a form it can easily be left blank or if you step back and think, it likely isn’t something worth your consideration anyway.

My senior quote was actually “If you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.” - and boy did that come full circle.  Could I have went to UGA alongside a bunch of my fellow high school classmates? Sure. Would I have been a better lesser person for it? No. But Georgia Tech, being the tough school that it is, has offered me a great opportunity to take the harder route - and benefit from it.  Did I spend nights in my first semester sad and without a real friend group? Yes. Did it take me a while to become accustomed to no longer being the big fish in a small pond? Hell yes. Is my GPA anywhere near what I hoped for it to be? Absolutely not. 

But the fact is, I’m still here now. I did eventually find a good group of friends - friends that have made me challenge a lot of my core beliefs and friends that I wouldn’t have met if I’d taken the easier route.  Am I still struggling to learn how to do well here? Absolutely. But, I’m finishing up my second year here and I’m finally understanding what works and what doesn’t. I can’t wallow in self-pity and get stoned every day, doing the bare minimum as I did in high school - figured that one out the hard way. 

This seems to be a common theme here at Georgia Tech. We’re a bunch of people who decided to take the less traveled path and challenge ourselves. You’ll suffer, you’ll wish you’d taken the easier route - but ultimately, it’ll push you to grow in ways that you never would’ve thought possible. Gatech, despite all the complaints, is a place to find out what kind of a person you’re going to be in life, and a place where you’ll meet some of the most brilliant minds you could ever meet.

Ultimately, the decision is up to you, but don’t be discouraged by browsing the reddit page - you’d be making your decision missing the other half of the picture.",Positive,"personal growth, college experience",20,2019-05-01

comment,"I normally woke up to my alarm at 9 am for my 10 am MATH 2550 class. But the final was at 8 am so it was a super early morning for a hard final at an hour of the morning where no one should be forced to do calculus. I wasn't in the greatest position for the final, but not terrible. I needed something like a 60 for a C, and an 80 for a B since this class wasn't curved. 

So I'm there in the final and it's really hard. Like so tough. I'm starting to panic, thinking I might not even get a 50, and thus fail the class. Then, some time in, I hear this faint music that was probably coming from the room next door. It's really distracting and it doesn't stop. It's so so quiet that I wonder if I'm going crazy, but soon other people notice too. People start looking around, the TA's are whispering amongst themselves. 45 minutes pass. Some TA's think it's coming from inside the room so they search for the source. I'm so frustrated and distracted by this music that I'm basically just giving up on this test. Suddenly I catch a lyric of the song and realize that it is my 9 am alarm that's been playing on repeat on low volume in my bag for nearly an hour. I'm so embarrassed that I just about die. 

For the record, everyone did so bad that the average was in the 50s and the class ended up being hella curved after all. I can't help but wonder if everyone did so bad because of me and my stupid alarm.",Negative,"school, exam, distraction, embarrassment, curve",2,2019-05-01

If you've seen a very similar question on the test that was on a homework, first do that problem, and then do questions based on how much time you think they are going to take. I usually do well when I start from easiest to hardest, because it increases my confidence and I won't panic thinking I don't know a question.
Also, if you have time (especially if its a final), get a scratch piece of paper when you are checking your work and redo the problem again. If you just skim through a problem you already wrote, it is likely your mind will not notice the mistake and it will automatically correct it when your brain is processing it because you are not actively thinking about the question, just proof reading it.
This may also sound stupid but I've found it is important: write as neatly as you can.

I’ve been taking 12-13 credit hour semesters since and it’s been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I get that not everyone can do exactly that though because they may have additional requirements, but honestly just try to stick to as few as you can especially during your first year. 

Also start thinking about study abroad if that’s something you think you’d be interested in! Perhaps for the following summer or school year.

Try hand writing notes even if you don't plan to look at them. A few studies show that you learn better writing things down instead of typing them, and it's worth abusing that efficiency. It's also harder to be distracted or be a distraction while writing notes on paper; typing means you can just tab over to reddit or whatever and half-miss what's going on.

I would say to stick with GEML in the beginning, you’ll be able to get into Econ classes and also take math or computer science.

comment,"The whole ppt was fundamentally a bit vague and the profs were saying that it wouldn't benefit our current class, only the next class. Big red flag for me, lack of detail and lack of immediate change seems like lack of conviction to me.

What little I remember from the ppt they gave, and my full thoughts:

1) Notebooks are gonna stay and likely won't be digital in the new 2310. The notebook checks shouldn't be random. I get that we need them, but instead of 3 times a semester, maybe something else? Also, I don't understand why going digital is so problematic. Some TA was complaining about plagiarism, but there's free software to deal with that.

2) In the new 2310, there was supposedly going to be less skill-building and what remains would be focused on the project. I don't remember exactly what they eliminated, but there won't be stupid drawings anymore. My thoughts: Not really specific, from where I stand. I like that the drawing 10 perfect squares and 20 cubes thing is probably gonna be out of the curriculum, but that was only 3% of my final grade, there's still tons of work remaining fundamentally. The skill building that you replace with could be just as useless and time-consuming, especially if it's early in the semester when nobody has thought up a final prototype yet. And I can't recall if the foam skill-building project is still gonna stay in or not; if it does, that sucks and is probably a time-waste.


3) In the new 2310 the lectures will be spent on going over skill building stuff from the class. I like this, since there won't be disagreements between John and Marty, but what happened to all the material we didn't go over? The midterm exam basically had nothing from the lab sessions, only the old lecture ppts, what happens to them? Actually, the 2310 exam had 5 readings and videos that weren't gone over in class that students were responsible for. Do the old ppts become additional things students have to go over by themselves?

4) The new 2310 will have a more sane schedule with less overlapping deadlines. I definitely don't believe this; no details given, which is alright, since this is the kinda time planning that takes awhile, but also if this class is still a skill-building and project class combined, then there simply isn't enough time in the semester to make a sane schedule. And there seems to be some kind of assignment creep that the professors are kinda subject to anyways. For whatever reason, our semester was the first semester to have a solidworks project. I have no clue if there were any assignments cut for that (I mean, we didn't have to do an essay at the end of the semester, but that's near finals week when I'm really free and have the project finished up, not the week before the P3 presentations).

5) There is no plan to separate 2310 into a skill building and a project class. This kinda sucks.",Negative,"education, changes",1,2019-05-03

My best advice for you in the course is to take everything you're expected to do before going into lab seriously. Skim the prelab reading and do the prelab to understand it. Then you will get a pretty good score on the prelab quiz and you will have a much better foundation to do the actual lab. This understanding just compounds as the labs get harder, and you will do much better on the end of semester exam. 

We see so many students that half ass prelabs because they are time consuming. I can guarantee you that doing this will make labs take about 4x as long total and you will probably have to redo the prelab. So don't be that student!

Also, if you can find a GTA or classmate to proofread your lab reports before you turn them in it will save you a lot of points.",Positive,course,2,2019-05-03

Part of the limit is because there was a problem a while back with people hoarding classes other people needed to graduate. (extra options i guess), so the limit keeps that in check.

Part of it is probably because even if you take a W in a class, you still pay for it, so you can't overestimate yourself too much if you are limited to 21 (which is still a HUGE ton)

comment,"Sorry for the length in advance lol. My overall sentiment is that if I'm paying this much for college, I should love the experience. I don't hate Umich, but I don't love it either and I have a gut feeling that GaTech would be better for me.

For Umich:

Pros:

* More well rounded (better humanities, business offerings, etc. and grad schools)
* Strong alumni network. probably better recruiting for areas like consulting/finance (which I am somewhat interested in)
* Strong research opps (probably similar at GT, but slightly better at Umich bc of the $$ Michigan gets for research)
* Intern/Research abroad programs are very interesting to me and transferring would probably prevent me from doing these programs (both logistically and financially)
* Dorm/Food for next year will be very good
* Convenience/Less risk than transferring/Less stressful... I know I can handle the academics

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

* Weather
* Culture/Fit/Vibe. Honestly this is the big reason as to why I want to transfer. For me, it just feels too elitist, toxic, and cliquey. For example, there is not a lot of intermingling between people of different races (not a blanket statement, just my overall opinion and observation). The people are generally nice but only superficially. I also find it difficult to make real connections. Greek life is dominant and there is a culture of toxic masculinity bc of it. It could just be that I am not trying hard enough, but I have done clubs, living learning community, and what not and nothing has stuck so far.
* Not much offering in computer security
* Clubs are 1) not as good at skill building, 2) too broad, not enough clubs that are CS related IMO, 3) not very good socially bc people are there to just put it on their resume and leave (just my experience, not a blanket statement)
* CS enrollment just keeps growing, classes are being restricted (this upcoming semester you can only take 2 upper levels), Office Hour queues are long AF, etc. I understand that there are probably similar things going on at GT but IMO at Michigan it has not been managed well and there aren't many barriers to declaring CS at Michigan (both LSA and COE). Career fairs are notoriously bad for average CS students.

&amp;#x200B;

For GaTech:

Pros:

* Threads and course offerings. Umich does not have threads, and I feel like there are better course offerings at GaTech. I'm not sure if there are that much more security classes for undergrads, but will I be allowed to take graduate level courses/ECE courses as a CS major? I am not 100% sure on Cybersecurity, but I do feel like the threads curriculum and overall the stronger CS program may be a better fit for me.
* Club offerings look better
* Atlanta. I very much prefer cities. Ann Arbor is too small for me and restaurants are expensive (also weather)
* I feel like the more nerdy vibe will suit me and my personality
* Greek life is probably more welcoming here (I'm considering joining)
* I've only heard good things about GaTech career resources, but perhaps someone can give me more info on that?

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

* Gender ratio
* Stress. I don't know how it compares to Michigan but from what it seems its worse
* Risk of dropping out of Umich, applying, and not getting in to GaTech
* STEM focus may be a little too narrow (I enjoy Humanities classes, but not a dealbreaker tbh)
* Cost may be greater (or less) than Umich
* GPA will be reset...
* Food probably not as good as Umich, but won't be as big of a problem when/if I live off campus",Neutral,"college, transfer, pros and cons, comparison, preferences.",2,2019-05-04

Some thoughts about GT CS vs UMich CS:

CS is one of the less stressful course offerings at GT. Cybersecurity is probably one of those things you learn on the job/outside of school. Actually, we have a great cybersecurity club, a GreyHat club, and we regularly hold CTF events.

Culture wise, no clue how to address it. CS at GT is definitely one of the more chill places, but there is still this weird belief sometimes that you might wanna get an internship at a big Silicon Valley company to be successful among some of the undergrads that can feel a little silly sometimes,

Each user is accountable and responsible for any action taken with that user's account and password. If there is a business need to share access to an account, such sharing should be accomplished through system permission delegation.

This is the same reason why there's a separate tuition/fee payment portal for Parents that uses a separate login than the student's account credentials.

Edit: Another thing to mention - Cyber Security will lock accounts if they see logins from multiple geographic locations within a certain time-span. For example, if you're at Tech and your parents are in California and you both login to something in the span of X minutes, your account gets locked because it appears like a compromise.",Neutral,"ferpa, password policy, account security",15,2019-05-04

FERPA just dictates what the school can do with your records without your permission.  You're free to provide that information to anybody you please.  You are under no obligation to provide your grades to your parents - you're an adult and get to make your own decisions.  However, your parents are under no obligation to provide you any financial assistance of any kind.  

&amp;#x200B;

Don't try to find rules or loopholes to resolve this disagreement - sit down and have an honest conversation with them.  Explain to them why you don't want them to have access to your up-to-the-minute grades and listen to them about why they want them.  If you can, try to come to a compromise that both you and they are comfortable with.  They probably have very good reasons for wanting this level of access, and you should at least try to understand them, even if you ultimately disagree.",Neutral,"education, privacy, communication",12,2019-05-04

comment,"Took her this past semester, so I can only speak for this time. It's not exactly an easy A, but definitely an easy B. She changes up how she teaches the class each semester to see what works best and what doesn't. This semester she began taking online quizzes rather than traditional paper quizzes. She also gave us two attempts per quiz (for the short online ones only) which was a massive help, BUT beware - I don't think she's doing that next semester. You have \~14 weekly short quizzes and 3 long quizzes, and the long quizzes are still traditional paper. If you do terribly on some quizzes you can go visit her during office hours and she has this policy of ""come correct your mistakes and explain to me how you properly do them, and I'll give you half credit for each question you get right"", so that's really helpful. She also offers extra credit at the end of the semester which changes all the time. In addition, there are daily TurningPoint questions so attendance is mandatory but you can also make up the points if you do 2 Piazza posts per day of absence. Overall she's a really sweet person.

It's one of the bottleneck courses for CS major (unless you're people &amp; media thread), and this course will basically determine if you're a device &amp; system person or not. It will cover circuit designs(making your own bit adder, ALU and such), assembly language(LC-3), and C. Also, bane of CS majors, malloc. Leahy was the best, but he retired, and I heard Southern is teaching it now. From what I've heard his lectures weren't so informative, and 2110 TAs tend to be not so friendly, so you should be ready to do some studying on your own.

I didn't take 3630 (took 3790 instead), but I hear it's a lot of trial and error (and that most learn to hate robotics). I heard they use Anki Cozmo for projects, but I don't know if they'll continue using it since Anki is going out of business soon.

3600 will almost always be same unless you take it in summer since they'll cut a part or two. You can actually take a look at assignments beforehand to see what you'll be dealing with. 

http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

It's same project materials across all professors teaching 3600 afaik.

ISYE3770 was definitely easier than MATH3215. We focused more on statistics than probabilities, and a lot of it was more of an application problem. Tutorial on R was given but no homework assignment on it was given nor were we tested on it. It may depend on professors, but ours even let us bring in a crib sheet for all the exams. 
I have to say though, 3770 was easier for sure, but other probability stuff like Bayes' rule covered in 3215 might help with CS3600 better. 3215 or 3770 isn't a prerequisite for 3600, so necessary concepts are taught in 3600, but concepts are usually taught earlier on in 3215, which might give you easier understanding in 3600. I'd still recommend 3770 though.",Neutral,"semester, cs2110, cs major, bottleneck courses, device & system, circuit designs, assembly language, c, malloc, lectures, tas, studying, 3630, robotics, anki cozmo, 3600, summer, assignments",3,2019-05-06

comment,"There are a lot of good websites filled with recipes if you want some inspiration, or just copy what you’d get at a restaurant and look up how to make it. The biggest challenge is really just deciding what to make so the restaurant trick is helpful.

If you’re feeling lazy just pick up a grain (rice, bread, pasta, etc), a meat (or eggs or high protein vegetable like beans if you don’t eat meat), and some vegetables, and just cook them in no particular fashion. 

Getting nonperishables like mac n cheese or ramen or oatmeal are nice to have around. I also suggest getting stuff to snack on and lunch stuff. Sandwiches are a nice easy thing to quickly throw together in the middle of the day. Fruit also makes a good snack, just pick out an apple/orange/banana/whatever and you’ve got yourself a snack. 

Obviously get a pot, a pan, plates and silverware. All in all, the investment in these should be easily coverable by the savings from not being on a meal plan. They sell decent cookware at publix if you have nowhere better to look.

comment,"If you're living with your friends, I know people who will split meals with their roommates to save money. Even if you are cooking for yourself, you can make large batches of food and refrigerate/freeze things for later. There are even some meals (like chili and soup) that taste better after sitting for a while. 

And as much as I actually like cooking, I find that prepping ahead is the best way to keep on budget, because coming home late and tired makes it really easy for me to give into temptation and just go out/order food. And planning out my meals keeps me from waisting money on food that goes bad before I can eat it.

As for recipes, I like the website budget bytes, which breaks down meal costs by serving and for the total recipe. Also work on slowly building up your spices/sauces collection, then you can get a few recipes you're good at and do variations on that (like a basic stir fry with different sauces, or tweaking a pasta dish).

comment,"D is still passing and still awards credit (Degree Works checks it off and accepts it as course requirement fulfilled), but CS2110 is prerequisite for other classes later on (not all courses require C or better for prereqs, but most do). For your thread, there are 2 courses that require C or better in CS2110. 

* CS 3451 (Computer Graphics - required for media thread)
* CS 4476 (Intro to Computer Vision - optional, needed for intelligence thread, can choose other courses for ""Approaches to Intelligence"" requirement)

So if you plan on keeping intelligence &amp; media thread, you do need to retake CS2110. 

If you're not so far into intelligence thread though (haven't taken CS3600 yet), you can switch to people thread and take CS2261 (which I hear is significantly easier) instead. People thread requires some psychology courses, and I hear there's a lot of paper-writing and presentations.

Also, it probably isn't an issue, but watch out - D is still passing, but you can't get a degree with just D's. 2.0 cumulative GPA is a minimum requirement for an undergrad degree.

You don't want someone to just feed the group bologna sandwiches as their meal, or order a couple of pizzas every time it's their turn to provide the meal. Our group had a price range for the meal so it didn't get outrageous and no one felt guilty or resentful for how much they spent, and specified the meal had to be home cooked. But also be flexible, sometimes things happen and people may not be able to cook when they said they would, and might need to just order those pizzas so they can finish a project.

&amp;#x200B;

When it was my turn, I mostly made meals that came from my family. Grew up in a family of 5, so I just doubled recipes my parents used to make for us. They tended to be cheaper and fairly healthy. Pasta meals tend to be the easiest, and crockpots/Instapots can easily make a meal while you're in class all day (my wife calls them Dump Meals, dump the ingredient in the crockpot, turn it on, dinner's ready when you get home). Most of the crockpots/Instapots have cookbooks you can get, just look for recipes that serve 8-10 and sound good!  


Buy in bulk from Sam's or Costco to save money. I graduated in 2003 and left Atlanta in 2004, so I'm not sure what you have access to these days. But bulk saves you money and allows for more ingredients.

comment,"SGA, thanks for the effort. However, you are making a simple problem more complicated than necessary. Here's why. Right now we all know:

1. Students pay good money for the meal plan, and individual food items are expensive.
2. Aramark and Sodexo are capable of providing good quality of service, when the contract price is right.
3. The problem is GT admin sells our dining program to the lowest bidder.

So, the most important question in front of us is this:

**How much does GT get each year from students for their meal plans and dining dollars, and how much of it is paid to Aramark each year?**

Once we get the answer to this question, We'll know  what to expect from the new vendor, and if there's any middleman making money off students.

Honestly, I don't think the food vendor should spend extra money hiring ambassadors. They should spend all the money on better food for students and better wages for their employees. On the contrary, if GT's leadership for campus service ignores constant complaints from students everyday, then GT might need new leadership for campus service. **We cannot expect a food vendor to provide proper oversight for itself.

That course (as a matter of fact, the entire catalog of Hindi courses) is not listed on that list, so I would assume it doesn't satisfy the requirement (core curriculum requirement is same for all majors). But if you want to be sure, you should contact your advisor or ModLang department chair to make sure if it's accepted or not. One easy way to check is to register for the class and go to Degree Works and see if that course shows up on the humanities section as in progress.

comment,"Do remember CS2340 is a team project course, and how hard the course is for you will largely depend on what kind of teammate you get. You could end up with degree-seeking industry expert and get hard carried, or you could end up with a bunch of freeloaders and hard carry them yourself. Of course, you can let the professor know what happened and most likely the professor will be lenient with your grading even if the project wasn't completed perfectly (you get couple occasion to officially rate your teammates and you can always privately contact the professor about it too). But you should at least make sure you're pretty comfortable with Java, as the course won't do much to teach you how to code, but how to manage project and workload. You should be fine since you'd have taken 1331, but more extensive coding in Java in 1332 would really help you in 2340. Also, course material for 2340 may change a little because Bob Waters retired and no longer teaches the course. So I wouldn't count on how the course used to be.

If you do decide to take all three courses together, I'd recommend giving yourself some breathing room for the semester and choose easier courses for the rest. All three courses are very programming heavy and you'll be writing a lot of codes. For 2110, you won't be coding much in the beginning, but when you get to C, all hell breaks loose.

So it's not just this guy, but at least 8 others, and they were definitely in a social frat (someone else I knew figured it out which one, but I don't remember cause that wasn't something I cared about).

Keep in mind, I have no idea who any of these guys are, how they had my phone number, why they added me, and how none of them ever thought to look at the member list and kick me out.

The major definitely has its ups and downs though. Some people see CM as like a dumbed down version of CS and so CM students tend to be heavily overlooked and underestimated. Also the quality of the LMC (liberal arts side) classes you take heavily depends on the professor you have for the course because the same class may teach entirely different things in different semesters. So that can make things kinda confusing and disorganized. But if you want advice on classes and professors and stuff you should join this new CM slack: gt-cm.slack.com. It’s super new so the conversation is (s)lacking but if you start asking specific questions people are likely gonna start responding and talking more.

You should go into this major understanding that whatever you want to do with it is in your power.

PHIL 3109- 3hours (just to get a humanities req out of the way. or Phys 2212 should I mess up the AP exams this year and need a lab science)

English 1102 -3 hours

&amp;#x200B;

Total of 15 hours doesn't seem bad, but also not the all of the easiest classes. I was considering trying to add in something else like Math 3670 or something but that's a lot for first semester I'd think.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, any recommendations for professors? I had Yoan Delchev as a TA in DL math and liked him enough so was considering trying to get him. I've peaked at course critique and ratemyprof but haven't put too much thought into it?

In my opinion, if this major truly interests you, you should definitely take this major and do what interests you. Though, if what I said to be concerning to you and you are fine with getting a more well-rounded experience than a focus on media, you could instead major in CS with a thread in media.

comment,"Thanks for the questions! 

1. From my understanding, 5 people would be ambassadors to the student body but I'll double check on that. Based on what we were told, they (Aramark) like to have students who work as a liaison between Aramark and the student body to figure out what things need improvement and gather student opinion. It wasn't confirmed whether these students are paid, but from GT's perspective I imagine they would like to see a bit of both.
2. Given that these things are all explicitly written into the contract, if Aramark fails to fulfill them then they risk losing their contract in the form of it not being renewed for the next year due to failure to meet contractual obligations. 
3. That was the wording that was given to me- I'll speak with GT administration and see if they have anything else planned for now. Some things that were mentioned were increased social media presence (especially on platforms such as Reddit), a requirement that Aramark be required to reply to all student correspondence and address (or begin to address) concerns within 24 hours, increased nutritional labeling, and requiring a certain number of options to be available for certain dietary needs at any given point in time. Again, these are just some of the things our committee suggested. There's a good chance some of these were written into the contract, we just haven't heard about anything besides the ""Correspondence with Students"" section right now so we aren't 100% sure what made it and what didn't.
4. From my understanding, this means that Aramark will be required to meet with and maintain contact with the relevant organizations. In the past, we've seen similar wording translate to monthly meetings or lunches during which students shared opinions and suggestions that were then implemented into dining programs.

From my understanding, the school sets limits on what meal plans may be valued at. I'll do some digging to double check that, but based on some documents I received earlier in the year that seems to be the case.

comment,"We're conducting some drills that simulate small incidents like thefts to test our supervisors and communication officers in their use of surveillance cameras.  

For example, we may stage a typical crime on campus: theft by taking. One role player, the victim, will leave a prop laptop on a table and go use the restroom.  The second role player, the perp, will take the laptop and walk away from the area.  The victim will call our dispatcher and report the simulated crime.  Our patrol supervisors and communication officers will need to coordinate reviewing camera footage to catch up to the perp.

We try to do these often to maintain proficiency, but it helps to have new folks playing these roles to keep our staff from easily recognizing the role players. With as many cameras as we have on campus, we likely capture most incidents.  However, because there are so many, officers need to be familiar with the cameras' locations to quickly access them and catch our bad guys.  Easier said than done.

We'd appreciate any help you all can provide to keep our officers proficient and keep the community safe!

comment,"I'm assuming you're enrolling as CS major, and MATH 3012 in my experience was quite a tough class, so I wouldn't advise taking it in your freshman year. Taking CS 2050 before taking 3012 is highly recommended (2050 will prepare you with a lot of simpler combinatoric techniques and mathematical induction).

I'm guessing you already have programming experience since you're skipping directly to CS 1331 instead of taking 1301, so you're likely gonna be fine, but I'd recommend checking out Java tutorials beforehand. GT provides free subscriptions to [lynda.com](https://lynda.com) for all students.

Your workload seems pretty balanced for the first semester, so I'd recommend keeping PHIL 3109 instead of swapping it out with PHYS 2212. You really don't want to burn out the first semester (or any semester for that matter, unless necessary). So don't get humanities courses and electives out of the way earlier on, as you'll be stuck taking tougher major courses together later on.

As for FASET, the real incentive is the early registration. You meet with your advisors and you can register for classes at FASET. You could wait for your time ticket to register, but some seats in courses are reserved for FASET attendees, iirc, so it might be easier for you to register for courses you want.",Neutral,"course selection, college advice",2,2019-05-11

Law and Ethics - I had a guy named Dhooge. Highly recommend him if you can get him, he's a great professor and fair. This class is pretty much always just based on the notes and pretty straight forward.

MGT 2250 (and 2255) - take this with rudchenko if you can. A guy in my 2255 class said his teacher for 2250 sucked (I'm guessing he was talking about Remick). Rudchenko's exams are significantly easier, and apparently she's easier to understand then Remick.

MGT 3300 - I had Donna Kantak, she teaches Market research also. She's a decent professor. Quite a few of her lectures are dry, but also she has a lot of experience in marketing so you actually learn a lot. The class used the text book and notes heavily, but it wasn't particularly difficult.

MGT 3660 - I had a different professor, but this class was definitely the easiest to get an A in so you should be fine.

comment,"If you have a study group taking the same course, it would certainly help. It's a difficult course, but not impossible. It's just that the concepts are very different from calculus or linear algebra, so instead of building upon those concepts, you'll be learning mostly a brand new concepts. 3012 only seem to require integral calculus and linear algebra as a prerequisite, so you should be able to take 3012 if you have those credits, but the [course catalog](https://math.gatech.edu/courses/math/3012) does mention that CS students should take 2050 before 3012. Not sure if it's a requirement or recommendation, but if registration lets you register for it, it might be a better idea to take it with your study group.

If you do decide to take 3012, there are some course materials available online which you can use to supplement your study. Professor Trotter used to teach 3012 (but now retired) and posted all the course materials for his past class online.

[Also, an online textbook he wrote available for free.](http://rellek.net/book/app-comb.html)

[And his lecture recordings on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwrAypC51ds&amp;list=PLXYON2eS4HCVpuT8NxS1HqsvRHbsPKrpq)

&amp;#x200B;

As for FASET, you could certainly try going without it, but it might be difficult to get the courses you want if you wait for the time ticket. For example, for fall 2019, APPH 1040 and MATH 3012 is already completely full, and ENGL 1102 and PHIL 3109 is almost full, with only several seats being available right now. As for ENGL 1102, I'm pretty sure they will start adding more seats before phase 2 registration as this is one of the bottleneck course for incoming students, but for 1040, 3012 and 3109, you'd have to wait for someone to drop or wait for registration to add more seats.

I think you're still gonna be fine if you decide to forego FASET, but you should definitely research your options in case your schedule doesn't work out. Don't count on people dropping courses during phase 2, and prepare for alternatives. Once you're enrolled, you can declare your thread and Degree Works(can be accessed from Buzzport) changes according to your thread, and it will show all the courses you need to graduate. You can click on the list and see their prerequisites. Check those prerequisites and figure out which classes you can take right now, and check which classes have available seats. Keep track of those classes as registration begins, and some of them will have expanded seats, and some will drop courses leaving seats open. If the course has a waitlist (you can see them from course lookup in OSCAR), get in the waitlist early, as next available seat is awarded to the first person on the waitlist (not everyone on the waitlist may still want the course, and if they don't register within a day it's awarded to next person and so on, but you're more likely to get the seat if you're earlier on the list).",Neutral,"study group, course difficulty, prerequisites, course materials, faset, registration, waitlist, degree works, course lookup.",2,2019-05-11

I'm pretty set on using the displays I linked (or similar), since the project is to build a prototype for a product I'm  trying to make, and I know they're pretty cheap to order from abroad. Given that, it looks like your first option is closer to what I'm looking for (thanks!), but I'm pretty surprised at a price - the screens are less than $5, so its surprising that a display driver for each of them would run \~$40. That's not a problem for a prototype, of course, but I'm trying to keep in mind how I would scale this as I move along - do you know anything about how I would eventually move from those to a cheaper alternative?

comment,"A single still-image on one of those screens, constitutes just over half a megabyte of information. (360 * 640 * 24 bits, do the math) A single *VGA* output (let alone an HDMI output) can easily do that four times over at a decent framerate, but you'll need custom hardware *behind* the other side of the cable, in order to split or multiplex that data to multiple physical displays. But at least it is physically possible.

GPIO pins, though? You just might be able to get that much bandwidth by bit-banging the GPIO pins via a kernel module or an RTOS, which leaves no room for the Pi's CPU to do much of anything else (e.g. actually produce whatever content you're showing on those monitors). Except, if each of those monitors takes a 40-bit parallel input, you'll need an array of (e.g.) shift-registers to produce four of them from only ~40 pins on the Pi. Those put an (in this case) fourfold slowdown on the whole transfer process, putting this approach firmly in the realm of *im*possibility.

I've only worked at 2 companies in the software industry so take my perspective with a grain of salt: at my first company, we did lots of college recruiting and would have ""target schools"" where tons of money was invested into building a brand on various campuses because they provided quality talent, lots of talent, or were inexpensive to recruit from.  For experienced hires, I got the vibe it didn't really matter what school your degree was from - just that your resume had the skills the hiring manager was looking for.

At my current company, we do zero campus recruiting and don't care at all what school you are from (or really even if you have a degree).  You just get a huge edge in the hiring process if you have an AWS cert.

Also, given the amount of time and late nights you're going to probably be spending, APPH 1050 might not be a good idea if all the sessions are morning sessions. 

I'd drop 3040 and possibly 3043 for the coming semester, and take 3005/3006 instead.

comment,"First, don't get down on yourself about it; there's plenty of time to turn it around.

As for doing better: 

* Make a friend in every class so that you have a reason to show up even when you don't want to. 
* Start everything early so that you're never surprised by how long something is going to take. 
* Plan your time to the hour (with ample breaks) and don't get down on yourself when you get off schedule; it's mostly to make sure you're *actually* giving everything enough time. 
* Take written notes even if you don't plan to look at them because it forces you to pay attention in class and a few studies show that writing things makes you more likely to remember them than typing them. 
* Use flash cards for memorization-based classes. Making the cards forces you to go over the material and think about it in different ways, and reviewing them is like doing practice tests. Anki is great for that.

 Insurance Waivers:

Students who fall into one of the mandatory groups above but are already covered by a comparable insurance policy (i.e. through parent plans, family plans or employer-sponsored plans) have the option to waive the student insurance. Waivers are processed by [Blue Cross Blue Shield](http://studentbluega.com/#/), the insurance carrier. Note: waiver requests must be submitted by the waiver deadline for each term. Failure to submit a valid waiver before the deadline will result in automatic enrollment in the plan and the insurance charge on the student account will remain.

comment,"I took 16 credit hours in spring and got a 4.0. Here are my tips for success:

1. If you see that you are stuck on a homework for more than 4 hours, don't spend more time on it. Go to office hours for homework help. Also, avoid using Chegg and other homework sources when you feel lazy. If you just copy down an answer without actually solving it, even if you think you've understood it, you haven't until you've solved it like you're in an exam setting.

2. Start studying for midterms a week prior. The night before the midterm/final should only be for reviewing stuff, not learning anything new.

3. Wake up early. I know this can be difficult, but it provides you with a lot more time to study and get things done on time.

4. Never procrastinate, especially if you're taking a project based class. 

5. Implement the Pomodoro Technique when you are studying.

6. Time yourself when you are doing practice exams, especially if you see that you lose points because you can't finish on time rather than not knowing stuff.

7. Be as organized as possible. Write your daily schedule when you wake up. Don't write more than 8 tasks to finish for the day - you probably won't end up doing it.

I hope these tips help. They are very difficult habits if you aren't disciplined but you'll gradually manage (like I did), and the hard work will really pay off. Good luck!",Positive,study tips,11,2019-05-13

For him at least, he had a hard time adjusting from high school to college. A lot of Tech students didn't have to try their hardest in high school to do well, but at Tech you absolutely have to. I'm unsure what strategies you've tried so far, but for him it took going to class, getting a planner to keep track of his assignments, checking T-square (now canvas) every day to make sure he was on top of things, starting to study for exams in advance instead of just the night before, starting assignments in advance instead of the night before, actively seeking help when he needed it instead of hiding his struggles. Work with your classmates, use each other. I always tried to have at least one person I could rely on in every class to work with.

With all this it's also important to be kind to yourself. Try to get enough sleep and food. Do something fun. Take breaks. Go out with friends. You'll never have a perfect balance, but see if you can find what works for you.

comment,"BF here, this is all accurate, but I'd have to say the biggest thing that turned it around for me (at least it feels like) was deciding/accepting/realizing that I could do better.  When you're at Faset and orientation, they drill into you that ""you were the smartest one in high school, you won't be the smartest one here"" so hard that when I started failing things, I started to think that that was just the best I could do.  I figured I was an A student for my high school, but I was a D student here.  It was easier to believe that than it was to believe that I was capable of better and work to get it.  You have to remember that they accepted you to this school because they saw that you are capable of succeeding here.  Not everyone succeeds here, but I believe that everyone who is accepted has the potential to.  Don't get caught thinking that a C is the highest you can aspire to; figure out what you think you need to do to get 100% on everything, and do that.  Obviously it doesn't work out that way, but when I started aiming at the top, I found myself getting B's and occasional A's rather than D's and occasional C's.  Part of that too is finding friends (and loved ones) that will hold you to that standard.

There's always a bottom epidemic anywhere you go, but there's lots of verse ppl on campus so you'll be fine if that's what you're looking for.

Discreets will obvs have faceless profiles and headless torsos, but you'll find ppl with faces sometimes. Lots of not discreets are headless torsos too.

If you're a poc, there are quite a bit of ""masc4masc"" and ""no femmes no fats no Asians"" or ""white only"", or they fetishise ur color. The south does quite a number on the white bois.

You'll be able to find a relationship if you want one, but no one is ready for one. Everyone is into hooking up. From what I remember when I was on the apps, tinder is more for relationships if ppl actually respond to you, and Grindr is obvs for hooking up and finding ppl. The gays are super cliquey, so they'll be lots of groups of gay friends together.

For frats, I know Delta Chi and Alpha Sig tend to attract the gays.

The Pride Alliance club is currently fused with Out in Stem, and both have lots of opportunities to meet a diverse group of ppl. It seemed a bit cliquey for me tho, so I left after my first semester.

Honestly the best way if you don't wanna meet up through apps is by advertising urself as gay, whether it be having a rainbow pin on ur backpack or an HRC wristband. That way ppl don't have to question it, but you don't have to scream from the rooftops that ur gay. Also since all the gays know each other, all the gays will be aware of ur gayness if at least one other gay knows of your gayness.

comment,"I can give some advice here;  I did two internships and was kept on part time over the following school year after both of them.  I'm now a manager of a software engineering team that has interns some years.  If you've got the time and ambition, here's your strategy for success:  


1. Do all the work you're given initially and do it well (builds rapport and trust with your manager).  Yeah, it may be crummy for a bit, but tough it out like Tech taught you.
2. At the same time, keep an ear to the ground for things that could use improvement.  It could be small things; little quality of life improvements for yourself and your coworkers, or big things, like an entirely different/unscheduled project you want to take on.  You'd be surprised at all the low hanging fruit for improvement every company has, but nobody fixes because it's not anyone's ""responsibility"" or ""assignment"".  Make it yours.
3. For small things, and as long as your assigned work is done, just fix them and let your manager know.  It shows initiative, and care about making the company successful and helping coworkers be happier.
4. For bigger things, like a different/more interesting project that you want to take on, put together a proposal, and bring it to your manager.  A bit of our insight as managers: interns are generally temporary.  It's scary to give an intern a big/complex task in case it doesn't work out, and they have a miserable summer, leaving with a negative impression.  At the same time, only being there for a few months, it's fine to give them a bit of space to run around;  If they fall over, the cost is pretty contained.
5. Deliver.

&amp;#x200B;

At both my first and second internships, I was pretty bored and didn't like the projects I was given.  I stuck with them and excelled for the first month or so, and then in both of them hit my manager with a proposal for a completely different, way bigger, and way more interesting thing I wanted to take on.

Concrete Jungle is a volunteer organization in town that picks fruits and vegetables from unused plants on public land (as well as on their farm) and donates it to food pantries and homeless shelters. It was started by two Georgia Tech grads about 10 years ago, and I've been volunteering with them for a few years. It's a great way to meet awesome people and see the city; this event has games, and a walking or biking tour teaching attendees about how to spot fruit trees you can forage from.

comment,"I did co-op and internship as an undergrad. I did absolutely nothing for one and half of co-op rotations. It was super awkward to present at the end of the co-op what I did because I did absolutely nothing on my third rotation. 

My internship was completely different. I was given an assignment from day one and even traveled for work, which led me to look into a consulting job for my first real job. Anyways, I got to the point where I sat in a meeting giving an update to the CFO because my boss was double booked and needed somebody to fill in. 

The point is, it really depends. I didn’t give a shit about my co-op because I knew I didn’t want to work there or in that industry. I loved my internship because it aligned with my goals. I didn’t care I had a lot to do because I enjoyed it. If you care, keep asking. Even better, approach someone with a little bit of a background of what your looking to do or expect to do.

It is true that some programs will automatically reject you for not meeting their minimum requirements, but those numbers are just for the program to brag about to applicants.

comment,"Honestly, if you're just starting, strong lifts and ice cream fitness are the gold standards. Run one of them for a few months, then you can take your pick of one of the hundreds of beginner programs on the internet.

There is no magical way to get results quickly; you just have to be consistent and push yourself to failure or near failure during your workouts. Almost any program will give you good results if you do this.

Here are a few other tips that have helped me:
1) Only go as heavy as good form will allow. The weight will come later.
2) always have a towel with you. Yeah, it helps with sweating etc, but it's also the best way to designate that a piece of equipment is in use in the event of you refilling a water bottle or doing a superset.
3) don't be afraid to ask questions. Generally, if people have their headphones out, they're more than willing to help you with whatever. That being said, headphones in typically means they don't want to be approached.","Positive

My spring transcript had many required classes like Phys 2, Chem, Engl 2, etc and I did well on them. Had I known, I would have sent it to go along with my other classes like calc 3 which would have totaled to 60 credits. If they were going to judge me only on my fall grades (I’m a freshman) then I wouldn’t have applied because I was not finished at that moment. 

Now I feel like if I apply for spring 2020 they would then judge me on what I did up to spring 2019 yet I could have already been judged on that now.","Neutral

comment,"TBH it’s probably not a technology constraint but a CYA (cover your ass) one. Back in the day, results were sent out via snail mail - exact dates were unavailable. Tests were graded in batches, results were mailed out starting at a certain date, and by virtue of the grading system and the mail, most test results were available approximately around X date.

Fast forward a few years and now everyone’s online. With the possibility of server downtime, machine downtime, and increased chances of fucking up someone’s scores by sending them to the wrong person, giving an exact date that scores will be available is idiotic. 

Imagine 10,000 complaints from tiger moms because “you said it would be available on May 15, it’s May 15 and I can’t see Johnny’s results, I’m going to sue!” Because yes, that happens. 

Imagine 30,000 queries from anxious kids (who you can’t even legally talk to in some states without a parent or guardian) wanting to know “you said May 15 but does that really mean May 15, can someone please look at my score because my application is due tomorrow” - because yes, that also happens.

The test centers have the power in this scenario. Sure there might be some technology changes down the road that make it more feasible to give exact dates, but for a nationwide testing board giving hundreds of thousands of results multiple times per year? Not gonna happen.

I transferred last fall and was in woodruff for a semester and then found a room in Crecine for the second semester. Personally, I would try to live off campus and save a bit of money if possible. There are people looking for roommates on the GT thrift shop Facebook group if you want to go that route.

Did you get truly waitlisted or did it say deferred for review of spring grades? If it’s the later you got a good shot. If waitlisted I think it depends on what the people who got accepted choose to do. You can look at the admissions data on the GT Lite website. It looks like they accepted 17 ISYE transfers for the fall. Since ISYE has been ranked #1 in the nation for the last 25 straight years it has a high yield rate. For the summer transfer admits it had a 100% yield rate.

You can get a gaming laptop with a decent/pretty good GPU + CPU for about $1,000-$1,500.

I really did not like how McDaniel taught 1331. Notes and lecture were a mess. I really cannot stress how disappointed I was with the notes she wrote.

Writing about other things besides school definitely helped them see how committed I was to making myself succeed. 

Conclusion: Write essays not necessarily to meet their criteria, put what you think answers the question and is truest to you.

comment,"Agreed, I'm not entirely happy with this. Georgia Tech isn't supposed to be about coddling everyone and making sure that every student succeeds; it is supposed to be about separating the wheat from the chaff, ensuring that only the best and hardest working students graduate. 

Granted, for those who are truly lazy, I doubt this will help them that much. If they don't get their act together, it isn't like this is a get-out-of-jail-free card. Just because you can take a class 5 times is no guarantee of success in it, nor is it a guarantee you will graduate.

As someone whose C's in freshman year drove him to work harder than he'd ever worked before in later years, I don't see this as a fully positive measure. My GPA was capped by those C's, but because of them, I had to live up to my potential and get an entire year of 4.0's to meet the threshold for grad school. It was a fantastic life lesson in the necessity of sacrifice and facing the consequences of your actions.

And, if you are the type that believes that Tech's true purpose is to toughen you up for the real world, remember that this policy still requires students to spend ANOTHER semester going through the content. And there is a financial penalty to doing that for most students.

I understand your concern after that experience near The Varsity.  Their Peach Pies are my favorite, btw.

We help Atlanta Police out from time to time clearing the cars and parties out of the Varsity lot.  It can def get loud over there.   


GTPD keeps a presence both on and off campus.  At any given time there can be 10-15 officers working both on campus proper and the borders of campus and beyond.  We conduct patrols, traffic stops, make arrests and answer calls for service in both of these areas.

Wells Fargo is probably the closest bank to campus. Per my comment in that thread:

I had Wells Fargo and hated it. Their student checking account required a $1500 minimum balance or 10 transactions on their debit card every month, or else they’d fine you $10. Every month. Unless your parents help you out, you basically don’t have $1500 or have to remember to make 10 transactions every month.

Unrelated to checking but I was roped into getting their student credit card as well (it was my first credit card and bank account) and it has awful rewards and foreign transaction fees on top of that.

If you don’t need to deposit cash into your account often, I’d highly recommend Charles Schwab’s checking. They’re entirely online and have very few physical locations, but they reimburse all ATM fees an unlimited number of times when using their debit card, which means you can use any ATM whenever you need cash. Other online banks like Ally limit the ATM fee reimbursement to a set amount per month. They also have no foreign transaction fees and reimburse overseas, so if you’re travelling or studying abroad, you can get local currency from any ATM whenever you want.

Only downside is the online thing if you require physical location services (mainly depositing cash into your account, checks can be deposited directly using mobile deposit in their app), and they don’t have the option to send you email/text updates when your account balance changes. But I’d take those downsides over WF any day.",Negative,banking,19,2019-05-20

Fees aside, Wells Fargo is shady as hell. They’ve been caught making fradulent credit, checkings, and savings accounts in customer’s names without their knowledge or consent to meet quotas. You should never give them another cent if you can help it. It even has it’s own Wikipedia article:

A local credit union is a nice option, but I cannot emphasize enough how amazing unlimited ATM withdrawals are. Literally any ATM is fair game. There are like 2 or 3 in the student center from various banks. Someone is already using the Bank of America ATM? Doesn’t matter, just walk to the Wells Fargo one that’s open and withdraw whatever amount you want for free. 

If you’re studying abroad or travelling internationally at all, you don’t need to worry about carrying a bunch of cash to exchange for local currency. Just stop at literally any ATM you see anywhere and get enough local currency to last a day or two, and top up at any other ATM whenever you need more. 

I studied abroad in SE/E Asia. I visited 6 or so different countries and every one of those places has their own currency. And every time you exchange cash for currency you lose money, so you have to calculate how much you’re going to spend in the country every time you’re exchanging cash, then worry about keeping all that cash safe.

comment,"**Wells Fargo account fraud scandal**

The Wells Fargo account fraud scandal is an ongoing controversy brought about by the creation of millions of fraudulent savings and checking accounts on behalf of Wells Fargo clients without their consent. News of the fraud became widely known in late 2016 after various regulatory bodies, including the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), fined the company a combined US$185 million as a result of the illegal activity. The company has faced and faces additional civil and criminal suits reaching an estimated $2.7 billion by the end of 2018.Wells Fargo clients began to notice the fraud after being charged unanticipated fees and receiving unexpected credit or debit cards or lines of credit. Initial reports blamed individual Wells Fargo branch workers and managers for the problem, as well as sales incentives associated with selling multiple ""solutions"" or financial products.

I have lived here my whole life and can tell you it's generally safer than it was in the 2000s. You still see weird things like at The Varsity, but please realize this does not represent our city as a whole. In fact, it does not represent what you see day to day on GT's campus as many other replies say. GTPD, Tech's special district police force, is linked in well with the campus community to keep everyone safe.

On another note, I am honestly a little concerned for you given your description of the folks at The V. Calling homeless people ""hoodlums"" is pretty elitist around here and will only make you look bad. There has been a ton of gentrification around the area, and consequently many people have been displaced by higher rent.

GT is one of the top ranked CS schools...so yes they do.

If you’re looking at a $40,000 debt difference, that can easily be made up in a few years depending on what job/industry you get out of college.

But keep in mind you’re not guaranteed a high-paying job just because you come here. You’re still going to have to put in effort to have a high GPA, extracurriculars, internships, networking, etc.

You know your abilities better than any of us. In the end it’s up to you to decide if betting $40,000 on your future success is worth it.

However this is when you're only taking two semesters, and if you take all 3 semesters, you can exceed this limit for given year (you're awarded for full amount you qualify for in summer semester even if you were awarded in fall and spring). This still counts toward your total limit of 57500. Note that these limits are counting both subsidized and unsubsidized loans.

The issue is that all of this is calculated based on your EFC. Even when your EFC is adjusted, you're receiving scholarships, so it may affect your award amount. Still, current COA is over 28k, and your EFC will be zero unless you've had a job last year, so you'll likely be awarded full amount for everything, including Pell Grant.

The biggest problem, though, is your independence status. If you're not 24 or older, you are automatically considered dependent student, and you need to account for your parents' income in EFC calculation. You may need to speak with FinAid office to see if you can be changed to independent student if you're under 24. If you're 24 or older, no issue there, you're automatically considered independent even if you live with your parents.

Most of us do not run off to post on Reddit for advice about something like this unless all other avenues have failed.

Even if they hadn't considered this, or hadn't tried in earnest to patch things up, your comment was unhelpful. OP was asking specific financial aid questions and you instead gave advice about something else. It's akin to them saying ""I have a problem with X, here's how I am trying to solve it, can you give recommendations on how to do that?"" and then you say ""Have you tried not having a problem with X?"" It just doesn't answer the question. At best, it's unsolicited; at worst, it's condescending.

You say it's a valid assumption that they're thinking short-tern and haven't put time and space between them before reapproaching. That is actually quite a leap in logic.

comment,"Having just lived in home park for a little bit, 500 is a lowball offer, even for there. Also, you'll need to go ahead and have roommates or find people online looking for roommates. What is most unlikely is the 9-month lease. Nowhere around here does them that isn't Tech. However, you could always sublease the summer. Some homeowners in home park won't let you and will put it in the lease though. The exception to the 9-month lease would be some of the luxury apartments, but that won't be close to 500.

Also, much of home park is already rented out for the next year. Most of the exceptions are the larger houses that take longer to rent (the homeowners will rarely help you find roommates, they want everyone to come to them) 

If you are looking to live farther out, I would take Marta to the Midtown station. The Trolley will pick up from there. Since you said Kennesaw, I'll give you an estimated travel time from the mid-Marietta area of 1.5 hours with traffic, 45 mins to 1 hour without. Marta from the End of the red line (the 400 area) to the Midtown station is \~25 mins. You might wait \~10 minutes for a train because they run every 10 minutes (from the North Springs stop). 

Your best bet might be to continue to live in Kennesaw and commute to Marta. The North Springs stop will let you park for free if it's less than 24 hours and you can get a student Marta pass. 

Your other options would be checking out the downtown area, there are more Marta stops and you could potentially bike, but again the whole 9-month lease and needing roommates thing would come back into play.

I believe they lower the price every two weeks, so if you don't need the pass till late summer session, I'd recommend waiting a few weeks to save some cash. Call PTS to find out what dates the price drops and how much it'll be, it's not easy to find on their website. Also, you'll pick which parking zone/area you want to be in (assuming it has availability), as opposed to being assigned to one without any say. 

To get the pass, visit PTS offices in Tech Square (across the street from Scheller). There's a gated parking lot there, and they're in the building right next to it. If you're arriving on campus over the weekend when they're closed, plan to pay for parking in a GT visitor lot or street parking with ParkMobile until PTS opens Monday morning, otherwise they're ruthless when it comes to ticketing (speaking from personal exp when I was a summer freshmen lol). 

The annual pass takes you through August 14th. https://driverseat.pts.gatech.edu/ebusinessprod/Account/Portal is helpful, as well. Just make sure you don't mistakenly buy the 2019-2020 annual pass online instead of the prorated 18-19 one. Not sure if you can purchase the prorated one online or not.

comment,"I went to a late FASET, and for whatever reason got only 1 class that I needed. So here's my advice to you and all freshmen looking at registration for the first time.

1) Don't panic. You can (and probably will) change your schedule freely during the 1st week of classes. People sign up for sections, drop them, and waitlists move quickly. It's likely that you'll be able to get a section no matter what.

2) Use Courseoff to plan your schedule, and Coursicle to get notifications when classes open up. Come up with multiple schedules if possible, so you can be ready in case different options arise.

3) When you arrive, talk to your advisor or an advisor in your department if you just can't get into a class. They can help you understand overrides and permit requests, and will make sure that you can make full-time progress on your degree. You may not get the section you want, but you will get a section if you need it.",Neutral,"registration, advice, schedule planning, advisor, degree progress",16,2019-05-23

All 3 of these artists show that ""fuck you"" or just ""fuck"" can be used very, very constructively. Obviously, it's not easy but it can clearly be done. These artists are not saying ""fuck"" to any of the issues (e.g., suicide). Just the opposite, these artists are showing that people at risk can solve their problems by saying ""fuck you""! 

Some artists want to teach the world to sing or dance in order to make the world a better place, while other artists want to teach the world to say ""fuck you!"" (I'm advocating the positions of these later artists.)

Anyone who cannot control themselves with cannabis would be having issues anyways. Weed does not ruin people's lives. People's personalities being unable to control and handle themselves is what ruins their lives.

My life can have whatever meaning I would like, so if I want to chief some reef every night to alleviate stress and make my dinner and dessert taste amazing while watching some pixar movie, that is my prerogative and the consequences will be on me. 

If you would like to talk about drug use being bad, you should really be preaching to the entire campus, as most people are consuming alcohol far more than weed on a nightly basis.

As long as a person has any sort of self control and work ethic, they'll be fine.

On this, we can agree. That all said, have you tried going a few weeks without it? One of my friends has maintained a similar stance for a long time, and as his friend, I've respected it; however, he quit smoking a few months ago just to see how it would feel; he's described it as feeling as though a haze has lifted. He's interested in long-forgotten hobbies again, his social life has received new life, and he has a great deal more ambition. Even used ""responsibly"", marijuana causes chemical and structural changes in your brain. If you're okay with that, then alright; but why not try a little time without, just to prove that I'm wrong? 

&gt;If you would like to talk about drug use being bad, you should really be preaching to the entire campus, as most people are consuming alcohol far more than weed on a nightly basis.

Our species has evolved to use alcohol, being that it a very acute drug; for thousands of years, those with a low tolerance were literally killed off by it. What has resulted is a drug that we have tailor-made our bodies to process quickly; alcohol is **certainly** a dangerous drug when used improperly, but light-usage is not associated with any behavioral changes when *not* on the drug. Marijuana is another story. 

&gt; If a person is secure about themselves and what they enjoy and want out of life, they have no reason to worry or fear being ""left behind"".

True. However, as I saw with my friends, what you want out of life changes.

I'd be saying the same thing to someone who was advocating for binge drinking. Drinking a few drinks a night is one thing, getting slammed every weekend, another. None of them are ""healthy"", but pointing out that other people are more ""messed-up"" isn't a valid reason to ignore your own position. 

&gt;I think most people are more responsible than you believe.

I don't think you and I are going to agree on this. All of the drug-users I've known have derived no benefits from their use. Some of them made it out okay, but ended up suppressing their ambition, landing them in lower-paying jobs than they would have had. Some smoked away their money, racked up tens-of-thousands in student loans, and dropped out. Some went down in flames only to miraculously save their trajectories and become successful in-spite of their drug use, though still ultimately losing time in the process. The worst off did too much LSD and ended up as hollowed-out husks of men, their entire personalities melted by acid. Granted, there are one or two exceptions to the rule, so perhaps that's you, but I don't have a lot of faith in the responsibility of people as a whole.

There’s no way transfers can make up 95% of those failing and those statistics I found be accurate. 

The only way I could ever see this guys theory being the case is if it was a class like CS 2316 (Python 2) and transfers came in with credit for CS 1301 but the school they took intro to CS taught it in Java so they had to try and learn Python from scratch during the course. Cases like that where previous curriculum didn’t line up with Tech curriculum is the only way 95% could be true. Also transfers make up about a 1/4 of the students brought into Tech every year.

Comparing binge drinking to smoking a bowl every night is quite disingenuous. When a person drinks that much, there is clearly going to be damage done to mind and body.

I can see where you're coming from and there definitely are people who can suffer from addiction and throw their lives away. I do my best to keep good company who are as responsible as I so I don't really have much experience with people I know ruining their lives. These are just anecdotes anyways, and we're not really talking about all drug users. 

We were just talking about smoking weed, and a good portion of the american population is able to smoke without issues. In legal states the statistics show that there haven't been adverse affects to education since legalization, so I am not sure what else you can really argue.

Now that I'm looking at it more closely there do seem to be some semesters where there are disproportionately more Ds and Fs for Doolittle and Yoder. Thing is those are also the two lowest average GPA professors in one of the hardest ECE courses. 

If what he's claiming is true, you'd find similar bimodal distributions across many ECE courses and professors; it's not like ECE transfers only take 3040 with Yoder and Doolittle. This indicates it's more a function of these two professors, the hard course material, and their grading than ""transfer students fail more often""

Chances are you'll find similar distributions in the lowest GPA professors in many of a major's harder courses. I did a quick search, [here's professor Abdel-Khalik's distribution for NRE 4214](https://critique.gatech.edu/prof.php?id=ABDEL-KHALIKSAIDI#NRE4214), compare that to the other professor's distributions for that course.

First and foremost, these majors (ME,EE,CS) are all very different and you're going to need to figure out what types of things you're most interested in, so that you can start to answer this question yourself. Mr. Stark covers everything from the MechE to the CS side of the movies. Theres a reason an IRL Tony Stark doesn't exist... I would also consider computer engineering, if you pick your electives right you can make it into EE+CS-lite. In all of these majors, you can choose your electives to fit your interests, theres more wiggle room than you'd think. All this being said, heres a quick breakdown.

&amp;#x200B;

**Electrical:** If you want to design the hardware behind electronics; power systems, antennas, lasers, optics, DSP. Very little coding.

**CS:** If you want to code things. Hard to summarize since, even though it's nearly all coding, there are different threads all up and down the stack. From website development to databases, to AI, to embedded systems.

**Comp. Engineering:** If you want the core of EE+CS, and learn system architecture too. Basic EE stuff to start but then with a focus on system architecture (designing processors/ memory/ etc). Last 3 semesters are very build-your-own and you get to pick between ECE and CS classes, so if you want to learn some more CS topics you can.

**MechE:** You said you weren't considering it but tbh ME with a robotics concentration fits the bill of ""Tony Stark"" the best, strictly speaking. CAD, designing stable and reliable mechanical systems, you can also learn some coding if you choose.

&amp;#x200B;

comment,"Yeah not sure if this is a troll post but as someone who is/was legitimately in this dilemma: if you're actually set on doing both EE and CS and actually want to do hardware stuff, a EE with CS minor might be what you want. If you find you actually want to do software as many CompE's usually do with a more high level/computer architecture outlook on hardware, do CS. Neither route will be easy but the EE w/CS minor is probably the most flexible and you're right in that I have met many ECE people do masters in CS and not the other way usually. Again, only if you for sure want to do hardware at a low level design, I'd rec EE. The CS classes in CompArch I am told are better organized if you know that you specifically want to deal with computer architecture in terms of hardware and sensor integration (instead of sensor design and signal processing/controls).

comment,"Well Tony Stark was a EE. But he was also Tony Stark.

That aside, all of the disciplines you mentioned are really in-depth. If all you're interested in is CAD and 3D printing, sure, you don't have to be an ME to do that. Likewise, CS =/= programming, so if you like to code, you don't necessarily have to be CS or EE to do that either. Also, you don't have to be EE to do the occasional circuit design. GT has plenty of resources for you to build prototypes of your wildest dreams.

Personally, I still don't really know if I'd rather be EE or CS, but the only way to get a better idea about it is probably to actually do some projects and exploration on your own. But ME = CAD and CS = Programming is an extreme oversimplification. I will admit that I've also read that it's easier to get a software job as a EE than a hardware job as CS, but also the world's a big place so ymmv.

Scholarships: mostly, it’s just that you get a percentage of your money back depending on how well you do in the challenge program. Like if you maintain a 4.0, you get your entire program fee back (and varying percentages for lower GPAs). There are some other scholarships you can receive based on how you perform and interact/participate throughout the 5 weeks you’re here, but it’s not guaranteed or anything. 
Lastly, I would 112% recommend not having a job. You will not have time for much outside of the challenge program. With classes, homework, events, and personal responsibilities, it just is not a good idea. You will thank me later, trust me.

I believe you have to either sign a waiver with GT to allow them to share the information with a 3rd party (i.e. schools you are applying to) or it's in the application itself. I've never gotten one so I don't know how they're classified or if they show up on your transcript, you might want to ask the registrar? 

Honesty is best, and there is always a disclaimer when you submit applications that you're certifying that all the information is true.

Any university will have bias, just you don't know. I know someone with a C average GPA, but their father is a professor at Tech and got accepted. Maybe ""as far as I know"" should be "" as far as I have known"".  All university have some students maybe like a handful who are accepted not based on merit. It's just life. Application reviewers have biases; it's human nature, a reviewer who grew up in a homeless setting can have a preference towards homeless students. At the same time, humans have feelings for traits that important to them. One thing we all should learn is that no matter where you go, you control your own destiny, make the most out of it. I told my friend, you can fly to MIT and wear an MIT shirt and go to a lab, who knows where you came from.

The whole college system is now like a scam business. Demand is too high making tuition at some places just crazy. I think college who have more than 10 billion endowments each year should mandatorily donate 1 billion to the less deserving elementary schools, middle school, high schools, where people can only take algebra 1 senior year in high school. Crazy. Huh. The whole American education system is not egalitarian nor is life.

Some school districts offer less than 3 AP class while school district in suburban wealthy neighborhood offer 20+ AP courses.

I went to a Pearman Elementary school  in Cleveland, Mississippi (if you want to know what is going on in the Cleveland School District right now, research) in 3rd grade where there were no walls, just 6 ft. bulletin boards that have a 2 ft in height window at the bottom. demarcating the boundaries of each classroom. Shit, I flew like 10 paper planes to the nearby 4th, 2nd, and 1st-grade classrooms without getting in trouble. LMAO, that was fun. Easiest to cheat on a math test, drop the answers in the ""hallway"" and look through the window and there easy 100.

PS: I was joking in the comment above. Have some humor.  Don't be a robot, something that is probably np-hard complexity I guess.

I also know I have maybe 500 grammar mistakes here. so what, it's not like you can't become the President of the United States with bad grammar.  Bad grammar means nothing on Reddit.

Become the RocketMan, fly to the Moon.

For my friend, he went to a UC Berkeley hackathon wearing a Facebook Jacket, got a full-time offer from PayPal whose recruiters thought he was a senior at UC Berkeley.

More than likely Tech will close the programs rather than expand them for equal access. 

The group filing *knows* this is the likely outcome, and yet still filed the complaint. The complaint then only serves to do one thing, and that is to reduce overall opportunities. This complaint is clearly spiteful and vindictive. It doesn’t benefit anyone, it merely punishes the girls whose opportunities are stripped away. 

That’s why it sucks. Whether Tech should or should not have more male-tailored programs to compensate is another question solved in another manner. This investigation won’t achieve that though. And the group responsible for it knows that.

this one struck me as a bit odd. I don't really see why male students shouldn't be allowed to nominate faculty for these awards.

comment,"I'm probably going to be downvoted into oblivion for saying this but I don't care the following is the honest truth.

It should be illegal for public institutions in the U.S. to take gender or race into account for admissions purposes. Private schools can do what they want but it is a shame that public schools do not give every citizen an equal chance. I'm fine with zip code or financial methods like the FAFSA being used to help people from disadvantaged backgrounds in admissions but race and gender do not necessarily mean someone had a disadvantaged childhood.

Georgia Tech is guilty of doing this as well. For instance, the incoming College of Engineering class had an in-state acceptance rate of 48.2% for females and an in-state acceptance rate of 31.2% for males. A 17% difference does not just happen because so many more women are more qualified. A percentage that large undeniably indicates a bias in the admissions system for females.

If you went to a well off metro Atlanta high school you know exactly what I'm talking about. I have absolutely no reason to be bitter since I was accepted so I think my opinion is relatively unbiased. I saw quite a few girls who got accepted over much more qualified boys.

Also somewhat off topic but how come we never see campaigns specifically for trying to get men to go to college? The gap has become very large in this country between the number of females earning college degrees and males. In 2020 61% of all degrees will be awarded to women.  [http://www.warrenfarrell.name/pdfs/Mar.pdf](http://www.warrenfarrell.name/pdfs/Mar.pdf)

All the female programs and implementations of teaching methods that were put into the education system in this country to help lagging female numbers have not just helped females. They have also hurt males. These programs were well-intentioned at the time, trying to close the educational gap for women. Now we have the exact opposite problem. Hopefully, we will learn from history and not pivot too far towards helping boys close the educational gap when this becomes the new national education hot problem as it will over the next ten years. More neutral methods for both genders must be implemented.

What is happening in engineering education right now as far as gender goes has a lot of stark resemblances to what happened to the country's overall education system back in the '70s. It is quite obvious from the data in the link that artificially trying to change things of this nature to the desired outcome is a very delicate thing to mess with.

If you know your computer has established a connection with the ethernet (either by your motherboard's ethernet port lighting up or by your Windows/Mac telling you), then you're almost there. As stated above, you need to register your device.

If you are not prompted (as I was) by a register page, find your default gateway (google how to do this). For me, it is 68.234.129.1. Enter that  ip address into your browser, and it should take you to Pavlov's registration website, and you should be on your way.

Now, in order for you to have ethernet on your Switch, you need to register your Ethernet-to-USB adapter. Note that the adapter is what interfaces with the ethernet port, not your Switch, so we aren't registering your Switch. To register the adapter, simply plug it into your computer's usb port and follow the steps above.

comment,"Couple thoughts from reading this...and oh boy here I go commenting on something I shouldn't. Bluntly, the author is disingenuous, arguing in bad faith, and just seems like an unpleasant person.

1) OP's post history is really interesting in context here. Just an aside but...hey information should be interpreted in context.

2) Generally it's good scholarly practice to denote when highlights or emphasis is performed by the author and not hte person being quoted (see AEI's block quote with italics). He doesn't. As far as I am aware, the majority if not all of the funding for WIE comes from corporate partners. 

3) This isn't some news article, it is a press release. As far as I can tell, in the 4 days since it was published (noting memorial day weekend) no one has picked up this story. In fact I can't find anything other than the AEI link and links to the AEI link that mention this. I suspect that the author is misrepresenting him submitting a complaint as OCR opening an investigation...those two things are significantly different. The entire post seems 

4) In another post, the author made a venn diagram that is just making it impossible to take him seriously[0] It is based on some complaint he has (citing breitbart) that groups of students that share personal characteristics might get together to celebrate with member's of their own community, and include those who worked to make them feel welcome and a member of the community. He quotes the term 'neo-segrgation' unironically.

5) This press release is a really good example of a bad faith argument. Have some fun looking for markers[1] of a bad faith argument. For starters, the terminology choices that create ambiguity of meaning (e.g. 'update' when it isn't an update about this case, 'request for review' when the correct term is complaint' as he notes later, posting the raw text of the law without any guidance and then saying things like 'it seems clear'). He actually lists something closer to his real argument at the bottom. This isn't about equal opportunity for male students.

6) He posses this question: ""under what moral code, and under what set of ethical principles of fairness, justice and equity, has it become so acceptable to promote, fund and sanction so much gender favoritism, bias, preferences, prejudice and discrimination?"" My parents were alive before Georgia Tech refused to admit women, and I'll bet the majority of your professors were alive when Georgia Tech refused to admit Black students. I've watched GT Police and Atlanta Police isolate and harrass students of color on this campus simply for being on campus and have met *current* female undegraduates who's high school counselors counciled them against 'hard majors like engineering' because they are 'unbecoming of women.' I'll believe the author expresses his concern with sincerity when he lifts one finger to work on those other systems of justice and fairness. What he calls gender favoritism anyone with a basic knowledge of control systems would call correcting for bias or drift. If I rent you a car with a flat tire, fixing the flat when you complain isn't a favor.

* the level too which he plays the victim while insisting that others are bad for playing the victim

Peterson is one of those, unfortunately common, instances where the structure of his argument and his dishonest and intentionally misleading approach undermine whatever argument he is trying to make before the content even comes to the fore.

It’s pretty simple: white nationalists understand that if you have shitty views it’s easier to argue about your right to espouse those views than it is to defend the views on their own merits.

This article discusses Chinese nationalists' double standard on history. They define Chinese invasions of Taiwan and Chinese massacres of the Manchus as ""liberation“ but refuse to apply the same standard to Manchu and Japanese invasions of Chinese lands.

This writing also questions why they have fabricated some crucial evidence to support their Yangzhou Massacre and Nanjing massacre claims. Again, no judgement is made on the nature of these historical events. Fake evidence shows history has been reinvented and weaponized for Chinese nationalist agendas.

Meanwhile, Manchu in my writing was NOT a Japanese colony as you pretend but the name of the Altaic people that created the last Asian empire to include China in the 17th century when the Yangzhou invasion occurred.  

In what today's China hails as the Xinhai Revolution that ended the empire, the Manchus were ruthlessly butchered. According to the Reuters and European witnesses, at least 10, 000 of unarmed Manchus were killed in Xi'an City. Similar massacres also happened in several other major cities. This was genocide, a widely-applauded genocide.

In all, Chinese nationalists have edited much of Asian history, including the WWII part, to serve a similar yet more nefarious ideology than the one that fueled Japan's militaristic expansions. ""Anti-China"" is a frequently-used dog whistle that serves to suppress critical analysis that debunks their lies.

BTW: American readers who don't know much about the 2nd Sino-Japanese War may find some interesting facts in my other writing ""小英雄雨来：皇军的孩子“ on the Liberty Times（https://talk.ltn.com.tw/article/paper/1289641）that challenge the stereotype that Chinese nationalists and communists treated their own people and enemy captives better than the Japanese invaders.",Negative,"chinese nationalism, historical revisionism, propaganda, genocide, anti-china.",-4,2019-05-29

Hour works- I don't mind 9-5 jobs but the job has to be hands on too, I don't like jobs where I sit at a computer all day. I am flexible. 6.)

comment,"1. This is fair, but again that's why you would choose literally any highly ranked school. What companies recruit here that interest you? What labs would you want to work in? What clubs excite you. Really this question is to ask you to determine your own fit. If you come here and just go to class and expect to make strong friendships, you're going to struggle.

2. That's fair. You should research what jobs you can do at each company with the major you're in. Like a lot of people in BME realize a degree in ME would give them more industry flexibility. I'm curious what job interests you at Delta because the airline industry is fairly different than the others you listed.

3. Are you really interested in engineering then? Especially for the companies like NASA or SpaceX. You can get stuck designing one very particular piece, of a particular component, of a particular part - for months to years. I had a friend who worked at Medtronic Spine who spent 18 months on a single screw. That kind of tedium would kill me. Which is why I and a few of the people I know went with start ups (of our own, or joining them as employees).

4. You will always work with people in engineering, and even some zombies you're shocked are working without a brain.

5. Family can be super difficult with companies like Space X. You mention being fine with 9-5, but what about 7-9. The lifestyle in some of these West coast companies is extremely unhealthy - exciting for sure - but unhealthy. One of my friends from Carnegie Mellon told me about a time Elon raged at a bunch of upper level employees because they weren't there to debrief at something like 3 AM. 

6. NASA may give you the opportunity to work near Georgia - but spots are crazy selective. Space X is West coast AND super selective. Delta has a strong atl presence, but again I'm curious what job excited you. What about Lockheed? 


Idk. Overall I don't get the impression you've really thought through what you want to do and how you want to live your life. You can totally take the time to figure out. I just know a lot of students who came to tech to figure it out, failed all their courses, bombed out, and then even UGA was a difficult transfer.

If you want to come to tech, come to tech. But take it slow. If UGA can get you where you want to be in life, I don't think the stress of Tech is worth it. If you really do want to be at bleeding edge companies like Space X, are you ready to sacrifice the other aspects of life realistically?

I'll give you an example. My little sister really really wanted to be a doctor. But she kept saying she wanted to come to tech. After we talked it through, she understood that it just wasn't logical. Tech wrecks your GPA, unless you're an all-star at avoiding asshole professors and studying in general. Instead we got her applying to BS/MD programs and she got accepted into one. Now if she just maintains her gpa, boom, she's a doctor. No fuss about MCATs and being at the top constantly. 

TL;DR: College is ultimately just a tool to get you to the job/lifestyle you want. Choose the best tool for the job. If you compare a sword and scissors purely based on stats, you might consider the sword. But if you need to cut paper, you'd probably still reach for the scissors.",Neutral,"college, career, life choices, engineering, companies",5,2019-05-30

The only reason I'm immune to it all is because I have a backlog of drawings/sketches/3D models/3D prints I want to create, all of which I've had bouncing around in my head for 3+ months.

The sad part about this system is that it also does disparage a large number of girls who genuinely worked just as hard as boys and would have gotten into Tech even if gender wasn't taken into account. They get treated like they're a dumb girl at Tech by some because there's no real way of knowing without prior experience working with them if they're of the same caliber as the boys. Since girls don't go through as stringent of an admission process, as a result, people have experiences with the unqualified girls which cause them to be skeptical of all girls abilities. I see it all the time in randomly assigned group projects at Tech. A girl will be given the easier jobs to do in a project often because the boys while they won't say it directly, are not confident that the girl can do the harder parts. They also get disparaged outside of Tech. It's so widely known to the public that women are favored in admissions at Tech that I'm sure every girl at Tech heard their senior year of high school when they told people where they were applying ""I'm sure you'll get in you're a girl applying to Tech""

comment,"So I too transferred in. Though I'm not OOS, I was In-state, I don't think they look too much at how many times you've transferred, but they do ask you to put all the previous schools you've been to. Maybe that's how they check? I can't say for sure. 

So Tech is a university where they do a holistic review of your credentials. Personally I don't think my previous University GPA alone would have gotten me into Tech. I think having a professor write me a letter of Rec. and having some decent out-of-school activities helped (I did MUN for about 1.5 - 2 years), and I had a lot to write about. It did interest me so it was easy for me to write pages and pages if asked about it.  


So a bit long-winded, but I think what I wanna write is; If you wanna transfer to UF because of GPA. I don't think it'll make a big difference. **BUT** I think the biggest thing you can do is be more involved in clubs, events, and maybe some SGA stuff to make yourself look more favorable. :)

comment,"[AIR CONDITIONER MAINTENANCE TIPS.](https://www.minisplitairconditioningsystem.org/)

&amp;#x200B;

A little regular upkeep can go along way. So before you schedule a maintenance visit, here are some things to be aware of that can help improve your comfort and the efficiency of your air conditioner.

&amp;#x200B;

Change or clean the air filters

The most important maintenance task that will improve the efficiency of your air conditioner is to routinely replace or clean the air filters. Replace one-inch pleated filters once a month. If you’re unsure of the type of filter to use, your Lennox Dealer can recommend one based on your specific system. For all other filter sizes, your Lennox Dealer will check, clean, or replace them at your annual maintenance visit. Remember, filters may need more frequent attention if your air conditioner is in constant use, is subject to dusty conditions, or you have pets in the house. Contact your Lennox Dealer to find out what frequency of filter change is right for your system.

&amp;#x200B;

Clean the air conditioner’s coils

The air conditioner's evaporator and condenser coils collect dirt over time. This dirt reduces airflow and insulates the coil, reducing its ability to absorb heat. Outdoor condenser coils can also become very dirty if the outdoor environment is dusty or if there is foliage nearby. To avoid these problems, your Lennox Dealer will check and clean your air conditioner's coils, if necessary, at your annual maintenance visit.",Neutral,"air conditioner maintenance, tips, efficiency, comfort, filters, coils",1,2019-05-31
