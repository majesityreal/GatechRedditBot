posts,"I'm not totally sure I want to keep doing this anymore.. Chances are, this ""mood"" will pass in three, four days and I'll be back to my regular ol' productive self. But I don't really know that I want to be here anymore. I don't really want to keep studying. I don't feel very smart - or anywhere near as smart as my classmates. I don't think I can even ""fake it 'til I make it"" nearly as well as they can. I don't know why I'm here. I was pushed into this school by my parents to study something that I never really had any interest in but would ""earn me a lot more money"" than any actual interests I had - interests that I don't even have the time and energy to pursue ""to balance out the studying."" I feel shriveled up, grey, and like a husk. I wouldn't even mind crying right now because that way, it's at least some emotional release. But I can't because I don't even feel human anymore. I've dehumanized myself, or at least enabled it. There'll be times where I'll laugh, but it just sounds hollow to my ears, and it's always fleeting. I haven't felt anything but stress, anger, and sadness during the few times I haven't been apathetic because I've just shut down completely. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. All this time, I've been lying to myself in the hopes that if I do it enough, I'll start believing it, but it's been three years now and I'm tired. I am young in age, and yet I don't feel like it. I hold no excitement for tomorrow, and if anything, there are days I wish tomorrow would never come.

I have gone to the counseling center here. When I was referred to the psychiatric department to help me find someone off-campus because ""we can't handle issues that are that deep,"" I went to Stamps and I found a therapist. Once a week, I took MARTA, sat in on my session, and paid the fee before taking MARTA back. Things got a little better. But then the 2.5, sometimes 3 hours needed for that trip was too much. Even once a week. So I stopped. But I thought I was okay because I was in a better place than before. I thought I could take it. But I can't. The hopeless emptiness runs in me too deep to dig out. And it's grown too large for me to ignore, and I don't have the strength anymore to keep trying.

Maybe I'm just exceptionally weak-minded. Literal thousands of people have graduated in front of me. People come back and say, ""It gets better, it was definitely worth it."" And that's great. I'm glad for those people. But cowards just don't have the resilience for this, so call me the biggest one of all.

I don't want to be here anymore.",positive,0.982,positive,0.07814373897707232,02/03/2020

Feel like there's other stuff I want to learn and do and I know that I can dedicate time towards it but then I'll be upset when I don't do well in my classes--not necessarily because I didn't get the grade I wanted but because I'd feel like I'd have no right to be upset when I didn't ""give it my all"" for the class. In general, I really like the content in my classes but I hate the structure and feel like I have just enough time to learn for the test but not really appreciate the concepts because we'll be learning new material at the same time during test week so my focus is divided. My brain right now just feels very numb and it used to be a during-high-stress-time numb but its been feeling numb regularly everyday now. Like I need something to kickstart my brain nowadays, stress or caffeine, before the cloudiness goes away and I can be productive and ""awake"" if that makes sense. I'll joke around with my friends when I'm with them but in reality I feel very very empty inside. I don't really have that many close friends here but the ones I do have are clearly being hit hard this semester too so everybody's kind of grinding nonstop--just makes me think about post-college life when everybody splits apart for work relocation and stuff and I'm working a 9-5 financially stable office job but coming back to en empty apartment before repeating the next day.

posts,"To current or former restaurant employees: A few quick questions. For some context, I‚Äôm a member of a team for Mobile Apps and Services (CS 4261) building an application for users with specific dietary needs. We‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs very difficult for those on a special diet (gluten-free, avoiding processed sugars, strict vegan) to find nearby restaurants that can accommodate them.

So, we‚Äôre attempting to build an app that surfaces this information. It will highlight nearby restaurants and, potentially, specific menu items the user can order based on their dietary profile. However, we need to gauge how restaurants currently deal with reporting ingredients and fulfilling special requests.

So, if you worked in a restaurant as a chef, server, cashier, etc, we‚Äôd love to get your perspective on a few questions!

1. What was your title?
2. Where did you work?
3. Have you ever needed to deal with a customer‚Äôs specific dietary request? If so, did you need to modify an existing menu item, or did you recommend an item that worked for them?
4. Did the restaurant‚Äôs menu have indicators for any of these specific ingredients: gluten-free, dairy-free vegan, vegetarian, processed sugars
5. Did a customer have a question about a menu item‚Äôs ingredients that you didn‚Äôt know the answer to? If so, who did you ask?

If you have answers for one or more of the above questions, or have any suggestions about our project, please reply to the thread!

**SUBJECT:** Severe Weather Possible Thursday AM

**SITREP #: 2020-2.1**

**ISSUED:** Wednesday, February 5, 2020 at 3PM

**OVERVIEW**

A deep upper level trough will push into the eastern half of the country overnight setting the stage for severe weather on Thursday. At the surface, we can expect a relatively strong cold front to impact the region tomorrow morning. We expect storms to develop along a squall line ahead of this front producing heavy rain, strong winds and possibly tornadoes *\[see figure 2, below\]*. Timing for our region should be between 9AM and 12PM. Rain may be heavy at times and may exceed 2 inches for the event. The Storm Prediction Center just expanded the Slight Risk area *\[see figure 1, below\]* to include the Metro Atlanta region, with a large area of Enhanced Risk to our south and east. In addition to the severe weather threat on Thursday, we may have some wrap around precipitation Friday morning in the form of light snow showers and flurries *\[see figure 3, below\]*. Expect much colder temperatures (mid 30s) Friday morning with breezy conditions. **However, we do not expect any impacts to roadways or travel on Friday.**

I have not heard any reports of infection on campus, and panic is foolish and stupid. However, there's strong evidence supporting the story that the official numbers on infection and fatality rates coming from China are blatantly false and vastly understated. At best, we're dealing with something worse than the flu. At worst, we're dealing with a virus with a (POTENTIAL) 15% mortality rate (see the stories about the fluctuating Tencent numbers). 

Take preventative measures. Wash your hands more often. Educate yourself. Just be aware.

Oh, and don't be racist and assume Chinese students are the only ones who may be potentially transmissive. Chinese students are probably worried about their family back home, and we should support them as best as we can.

Final grades are calculated as follows: 20% midterm 1, 20% midterm 2, 30% HW, 30% Final Exam. I have an 80% average on the homework right now. And I just took midterm 1 an hour ago and I'm not feeling too good about it. 

Obviously I'm going to wait and see what I get on it. However, the withdrawal deadline (March 11th) is one day before Midterm 2. If I bombed this exam and got like a 50, then I don't think I'll do much better on the other exams and in that case, I'll be stuck with a C or a D. So the only thing I can base withdrawing on is this exam because there won't be another one before the deadline. 

 If I thought I was going to fail 2051, I would definitely withdraw before I let that happen, and then just take 2050 later. And I need a C to even pass.

**SUBJECT:** Winter Weather Possible Saturday AM

**SITREP #: 2020-3.1**

**ISSUED:** Friday, February 7, 2020 at 4PM

# OVERVIEW

**The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Weather Advisory for our area. This advisory will take effect Saturday morning at 0400 lasting through 1300 Saturday afternoon.**  

A shortwave trough will move through our area Saturday morning bringing with it the possibility for a brief period (1-2 hours) of snow or a rain/snow mix. The greatest chance of seeing accumulating snow will be in the northeast Georgia mountains. On campus, we are looking at up to an inch of snow (see figure 2).  Most models have our accumulating snow totals at less than a half inch. We expect to see precipitation begin sometime between 0700 and 0800 starting as snow or a rain/snow mix then transitioning to all rain as temperatures climb above freezing. 

While we may see big, wet snow flakes, we do not expect this to be anything more than a nuisance level event. With that said, it would be advisable to stay off roadways until precipitation ends as slick spots could develop in heavier snow showers. The system should be out of the area by the early afternoon hours on Saturday. Sunday morning travel should be fine, but you will need to look for slick spots in protected areas.  

**PRIMARY HAZARDS**

The primary hazard will be slick roadways.  Use caution while driving.

**TIMING**

Saturday 0700 ‚Äì 1200

**NEXT STEPS**

* The Georgia Tech Police Department Office of Emergency Management will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary.

posts,"Advice for a European Exchange students. Hey Yellow Jackets (I'm pretty sure that's your nickname)...

I'm a student from Madrid, Spain, attending a Mathematics and Physics double major at √âcole Polytechnique in Paris, France. I just got accepted to go on exchange to GaTech for the first semester of my Junior year (August-December 2020) and I wanted to arrive there with the correct expectations so that I'm not overwhelmed/underwhelmed or surprised by anything.

So... Coming from a school that loves sodomizing their students with a heavy and hard workload, I'd love to have more of a 'chill' semester to be able to travel a bit and just have a nice experience. Is this a reasonable expectation or nah? 

Do you guys recommend having on-campus accommodation or better off-campus? If so, is there a specific area in Atlanta where most students live? I know nobody there, so sharing an apartment can be kind of hard...

Also, are there many exchange students, and if there are, do you guys know/mix with them or do they just mix between them (I say this cause American students in Europe like mixing between themselves). If there are any European students reading this, a short summary of your experience would be greatly appreciated!

Lastly, how's nightlife/social life in Atlanta/campus and how difficult is it to move around Atlanta/get to the city centre without having a car? Having lived in Madrid, London and Paris, 3 cities with great public transport I've moved most of my life in it, but I know American cities, in general, aren't that great in this aspect. I basically don't want to be stuck on campus for my 6 months of freedom.

P.S: I spent about 1-hour researching courses and chose some pretty random ones: Partial differential equations MATH4348, PHY2022 Stars Galaxies and the universe (I think this will be my 'easy' course), ME3345 Conduction and radiation heat transfer, ISYE3133 Engineering optimization, ECON3150 Economic and financial modelling. Any of them you would completely reject? How's the style of teaching (mostly you do your own studying at home or are there exercise sessions...).

Sorry for the super long post,

A confused dude.",positive,0.988,positive,0.15796243686868688,02/08/2020

posts,"How to recover from a disappointing start?. So, I'm about to graduate but I want to stop a problem I've consistently had. I tend to be doing okay until the second test or project and then the bottom falls out of my grades. 

Taking ME capstone, Sys Lab, CS 2110, and CS 1332. I don't need the last two but I developed an interest in the material last summer. So far I'm tracking to make a B in everything, I need one more A to graduate with a 3.0 which I desperately want because of the job search. I could still easily make mistakes and earn a C in a couple of classes.

The CS classes confuse me. The tests/quizzes feel dead easy but I still make Bs. HW is easy.

SYS lab just feels really annoying, currently in the Thermal/Fluids/Heat transfer segment which is the material I struggle with the most.

Capstone fine but I'm scared it will become too much in about a month.

&amp;#x200B;

How do you recover in the middle of the semester when you have tons of stuff going on? Looking back I always felt like I could never regain my balance once things got hectic.  I'd panic about a test, mess up my sleep/eating/exercise schedule to take care of it, and then I would be off for weeks.

posts,"Situational Awareness: Flash Flooding Risk Overnight. ***NOTE:*** *We believe that the campus should generally be fine, but commuters who live in the NW metro area should pay particular attention to this.*

\*\*\*\*

# SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

**SUBJECT:** Flash Flooding Risk Overnight

**SITREP #: 2020-4.1**

**ISSUED:** Monday, February 10, 2020 at 1530

**OVERVIEW**

The Weather Prediction Center issued a rare High Risk for excessive rainfall for our region this afternoon. This is due to a stalled frontal boundary over the northern half of Georgia that will produce significant rainfall overnight tonight in areas that already have saturated grounds. Storms may persist over the region overnight into Tuesday morning. While most models show the axis of higher precipitation amounts setting up to our north and west, the National Weather Service (NWS) is concerned that a slight change in that axis would shift it over Metro Atlanta. Additionally, flash flooding is most pronounced in an urban setting with much more impervious surfaces that produce runoff. Typically, the Georgia Tech campus remains safe in these events and we expect minimal impacts locally. Our main concern is with commuters and those that live in the NW Metro area, such as Cobb, Bartow, Paulding, northern Fulton, Cherokee, &amp; Forsyth Counties. Be especially careful driving overnight tonight as flooded roadways are often difficult to detect and may be much deeper than they appear. As always, follow the guidance of ‚ÄúTurn around, don‚Äôt drown.‚Äù 

[Figure 1: Excessive Rainfall Outlook \(Weather Prediction Center\)](https://preview.redd.it/gauwl3qsu5g41.png?width=573&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=692b6c0cf3141d83a77e61900b6d9461dd57fc00)

**PRIMARY HAZARDS**

The primary hazards will be from flash flooding.

**TIMING**

Monday Night into Tuesday Morning

**NEXT STEPS**

* The Georgia Tech Police Department Office of Emergency Management will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary.
* Follow the GT Office of Emergency Management on twitter [@gtpdalerts.](http://www.twitter.com/gtpdalerts)

Register to vote in the primary to state your candidate preference for the general election!

&amp;#x200B;

# You Can Vote This Year In Georgia If You Answer YES to the Following:

* I am a citizen of the United States     
* I am a legal resident in Georgia 

1. This is **YES** if you attend Georgian Tech and live in Georgia.
2. There are *no time requirements for residency*, so if you moved from out of state to attend school here, you can register in Georgia! (Don't vote in both states, choose one)
3. *You can register if you live in a dorm*! 

* I am at least 17¬Ω years old      
* I am not serving a sentence for conviction of a felony        
* I have not been found mentally incompetent by a judge

# You Must Register by February 24:

* Got a drivers license already? 
   * You can simply register to vote online [here](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/voterDetails.do#). Takes 3 minutes.
* Don't have a drivers license? Out of state student?
   * Don't worry! Print [this](https://registertovote.sos.ga.gov/GAOLVR/images/reg_form.pdf) off with a scan of your GT ID and drop it in any mailbox (There's a post office in the student center on the first floor, printer on second floor). No stamp needed! Adobe Scan is a great (and free) app from the app store to scan, manage, and email documents. 
* Already registered? 
   * Check your registration status [here](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/voterDetails.do#). Georgia removed 300k voters last year! 

# Where/When do I vote in the Primary After Registering?

1. Georgia Tech is hosting early elections this year on **March 9** and **March 10** from **8:30am-4pm** at the **Ferst Center** (right next to the student center). You can walk in and vote on the way to class (**Bring at least one valid form of ID**)! Too easy! It took around 15 minutes in line last year.

**Valid forms of ID**:

|Student ID (Buzzcard) |Valid U.S. passport |Valid tribal photo ID |
|:-|:-|:-|
|Any  valid state or federal issued photo ID |Valid U.S. military photo ID |A Georgia driver‚Äôs license, even if expired |

2. Regular elections will require traveling to your local polling place and will be held **March 24th** **7:00am-7:00pm**. Bring at least one valid form of ID. Find your local polling place by logging in [here](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp.do) after registering. You should also receive a registration card by mail a few weeks after registering.

3. **Can't make these times/places?** Request an Absentee ballot [here](https://sos.ga.gov/admin/files/Absentee_Ballot_Application_2018.pdf)! They'll can email you or mail you a ballot that you can submit. 

* *Requests* for Absentee ballots must be received by your county clerk by the Friday before Election Day (**March 20th**).
* *Completed* absentee ballots must be returned to your county clerk's office by the close of polls on Election Day (**March 24th)**. Mail a few days early to make sure your vote is counted!

&amp;#x200B;

# Common Misconceptions About Voting:

Registering to Vote and Voting does not affect your:

* **Federal Financial Aid**
   * Where  you register to vote will not affect federal financial aid such as Pell Grants, Perkins or Stafford loans, or your dependency status for FAFSA
* **Status as a Dependent on Your Parents‚Äô Taxes**
   * Being  registered to vote at a different address from your parents does not  prevent them from claiming you as a dependent on their taxes
* **Tuition Status**
   * Being deemed out-of-state for tuition purposes does not prevent you from choosing to register to vote in your campus community

Voting will enroll you to the Jury Duty pool. However, you can request a deferment from Jury Duty if you are a student, so this will not affect you until you are no longer in school.

So I'm a CS student here, and got a summer internship offer at GTRI. I've been in on-campus housing and would probably prefer to continue that. Basically my questions are how should I work that out, and just internships to begin with. Housing said something about registering it for credit if I wanted, I don't need any electives but can it count for specific classes? Also financial aid wise how would that fit in here in terms of Zell or anything else? Could that help with housing? I would ask the offices tomorrow but I got an email saying they want to know today if I'm applying for aid over the summer, as I previously said I would be taking classes, before I had the internship offer. Thanks in advance.

Tomorrow on Valentine's from 10-2pm at Skiles Walkway, Alpha Chi Sigma will be selling Valentine's day *Cards and Carnations.* This is our first philanthropy event of the semester and we hope to see you all there! 

**Each Carnation is $2, and each card is $1.**

You can buy as many for yourself, your friend(s), your significant others, or someone at Tech.

We are also holding a card drive! If you would like a Valentine's card addressed to ""Dear You"" come and grab one. We ask that if you do not have a specific person in mind, that you also write one! Alpha Chi Sigma will have about 30 or so on hand but to spread Tech friendship and love this semester, if you would like, you can also write to another Tech student under the name *To: Dear You, From: (how ever you want to end)*

Alpha Chi Sigma looks to aim for the advancement of STEM fields for the next generation and the promotion of love and friendship between Tech students. Life here is tough but hopefully Alpha Chi Sigma can spread some spirit and light tomorrow on a day meant for everyone to be loved!

All proceeds go to the Fulton Academy of Science and Technology - A K-8 STEM oriented school that specializes in creating Scientists and Engineers.

We hope to see you there!

posts,"Anyone in MSE/ME etc that can speak about their experiences in a semiconductor/electronics industry internship/job?. Hi guys! I'm an undergrad MSE who has previously worked in the consumer packaged goods industry and really enjoyed how fast development is. Because products are constantly being put on the market, the timeline from concept to product is very quick and I loved seeing the progress made. 

I am considering trying to find a job in the semiconductor/electronics industry, but I'm wondering if it feels like development is slower, and what it's like from a manufacturing standpoint since the quantities might be much lower than something like a huge paper towel line pumping out thousands of rolls a minute. 

While I enjoyed working in a research lab at tech, I sometimes felt a little bit disheartened working on such early ideas because progress would be very slow- has the electronics industry ever felt like that from a research standpoint?

TLDR; If you've had a semiconductor/electronics industry internship or job, what do you like about the industry? What do you not like? This is in reference to either manufacturing roles or research &amp; development roles.",positive,0.9854,positive,0.17608974358974358,02/13/2020

It is with great sadness that I write today to inform you of the death of William ‚ÄúAndrew‚Äù Collins, a first-year biomedical engineering (BME) major from Kathleen, Ga.

It is wrenching to have to report this news to you, even more so following the deaths of other members of our community this academic year. We offer our deepest condolences to Andrew‚Äôs family and friends who are coping with the shock and grief resulting from this heartbreaking news. Our thoughts are with the Sigma Nu fraternity as they process the loss of one of their members. We are also focused on continuing to strengthen support for our community.

We are working with BME to provide counseling and grief support for Andrew‚Äôs friends and departmental colleagues. Georgia Tech offers multiple services and resources to assist the community in troubling times such as this including, counseling and mental health support for students through the Center for Assessment, Referral and Education (care.gatech.edu).

posts,"GT Transportation Proposal. Dear Georgia Tech Transportation,

Currently the only transit options that are offered at Georgia Tech are Buses that go to select points on campus.  The buses in theory are nice but are usually late and are time dependent meaning you have to wait usual 15 minutes (on average) to catch the next one. I am proposing electric scooters at all the bus stops that have their own lock hubs. Students scan their BuzzCard and unlock the scooter from the hub. Hubs will all be equipped with solar panels that are used to charge the scooters with backup power from the grid on overcast days. Scooters that aren't returned back to hubs will be charged to the account of the student. To account for not having enough scooters for everyone after an hour of use the scooter user will be charged to create a sense of scarcity. Use of the scooters and general maintenance can be added on to student tuition transportation fees as needed. It would be really awesome to get across campus in an efficient manner that you yourself do not have to bring a bike or scooter of your own and have that as a burden all day. Scooter apps are nice for this, however, they are slowly dying out because there is no user accountability for the scooters (lock hubs would solve) which causes a massive cost burden  on replacing damaged or missing scooters. Please let me know what you think.

Warm Regards,

posts,"Graduating, Some thoughts. I  came here in 2016. I didn't do so well. I think I had a 2.7 and lower  at some points. Part of it was I didn't like my major nor my classes.  Another part was &lt;me&gt; trying to accumulate, and my friends the  structured group I grew up with... was gone. In short summary, I fucked  up, but I adjusted.

About  2 years ago, I realized things weren't gonna work out. I mean who would  want a 2.7? Hell, not even labs wanted me for free work. So I switched  my major even though I was maybe 2 (max 3) semesters from graduating.

I  liked my new(er) classes. I enjoyed the material. Part of it was that I  learned how to struggle through something(s) I didn't like, to force  myself to  go through the content and master it. I joined a research lab  my 2nd semester transferring (into the new major), and eventually got a  PURA grant, which in the scheme of things isn't much but it is *something.*

I maintained a 3.5+ my last 5 semesters here, and now have a \~3.04.

Now all I have left is 2.5 months till I graduate. Problem is, I have no clue what I am going to do.

I've  attended all the last few career fairs, company events. Have written at  least over 500 applications to positions I been interested and  partially interested in. I've heard back, but nothing solid with some  ghosting. Some companies havn't even checked my resume when I look online, I probably got  filtered.

I  would like to attend grad school I think. I realized that I know so  little, and bachelor's has basically given me a crash course on the  things that happen within the industry. I've delayed my grad school  apps, my gpa wasn't the greatest anyways and maybe I can make it to a  \~3.1, which to me sounds a whole lot better than a 3.04 or a 2.98. I've  been studying for the GRE in my free time, and while it has been slow I  think I can do well.

I am not sure what I ll do at this point. I guess it's time to start applying to stuff I *don't* like. Maybe look for some other productive/experience outside of internships while I apply for Spring/Fall 2021 Master's programs or Jobs.

But  this post isn't about that. It's about where I was and where I am now. 2  years ago, I was at the rock bottom, about to get another C in a class I  didn't particularly care about. Don't give up. It'll get better. Be  proactive and it will make a difference. (Special Thank you to the  professor who gambled on a kid who had a 2.8 and randomly  wanted to  join his research)

Glad that's off my chest. THWG and may you do well on your midterms.

TLDR: I fucked up my first two years, fixed it somewhat in the last two years. Now looking for a job or masters program. Hopeful, I am even graduating on time. Even if you screw up you can fix things (mostly\*)!

posts,"GT Housing is a Dumpsterfire. I am ashamed to be apart of the housing department community. I am a PL living in a freshman experience residence hall and have always been eager to change the lives of new students. Yet, housing makes creating that community nearly impossible. Since I've joined housing, it's always been told to me that hall directors are there to help SSMs not only do their jobs but also help them with the emotional burden. Yet, the one time I've reached out for help, my issues are put on the back burner and I cant even make contact with my direct superior. In my opinion, no one in housing seems to know what they're doing. I was once, in a roundabout way, made to feel like a narc by the hall directors on duty when identifying a resident abusing alcohol. Everything going on is unacceptable.

The director of housing, Sheree Gibson, and other higher ups in housing have destroyed all the good things about the freshman experience and are setting up housing to receive applicants desperate for free housing. By eliminating half of the first year positions, I am expected to do double the work for an extremely minimal increase in pay. The stress that Sheree has added to my life is harming my relationship with my bf and going into next year I am now expected to do the job of 2 people and pursue my BME classwork and capstone.

posts,"Without warning, Department of Housing has chosen to lay off over 60 SSMs. Without an email from anyone within Housing, my supervisor has let me know that I will not be returning to my position as an SSM (student staff member, i.e. RA/PL) at all, along with 59+ other SSMs throughout campus. We are being let off due to ""budget changes"", and not due to any performance measures. According to my supervisor, this decision was made several weeks ago by upper-level Housing staff, which has failed to notify any SSMs in any capacity since the decision was made. Those who were laid off have not been added to the alternate pool of new SSM candidates (at least, not automatically), but are welcome to reapply to become an SSM next Fall. Not only this, but opening positions from graduating students have been filled by incoming applicants, meaning that new, untrained applicants are being preferred over SSMs that have worked for Housing for several years. It's honestly insulting. By waiting so long to let us know, Housing has made it difficult to find a place to live during the summer. The deadline to apply for on-campus housing is in less than a week and it is now much harder to find an affordable lease for off-campus apartments for the summer.

It has become clear that Housing no longer cares about its employees, and for that matter, the students of Georgia Tech as well. SSMs are a front line of defense for mental health and wellbeing of students. In laying off 60 SSMs, Housing has effectively reduced the ability for Georgia Tech to reach out to students in need. Housing has recently increased SSM responsibilities, such as requiring an additional duty round and for SSMs to record resident conversations every week. When asked why these changes were made, especially without an increase in pay to compensate, they simply cited that ""other schools had such policies.""

This is SGA's new Undergraduate VP of Campus Services hijacking the Reddit (ran this account last year, so hello to anyone who was around then!).

Last week, we began working on a feedback form for any Campus Services-related feedback, concerns, comments, suggestions, etc. you may have. Our goal with this is to create an avenue where you can submit any and all feedback you would like to be heard by the administration. Last year, we did something similar to address dining specifically and are now expanding it to include all campus services. The form may be found here:

Campus services includes housing, parking &amp; transportation services, dining services, retail, health and wellbeing, student center, CRC, and safety (GTPD).

If you have any suggestions to improve the form, please let me know and I'd be more than happy to go in and alter it! The goal was to make the form short enough to be able to fill it out multiple times easily, but open-ended enough for you to give a thorough rundown of your thoughts.

You have the option to enter your email address. If you choose to do so, I will be reaching out to you regarding your feedback and will follow-up again after I have spoken to the relevant administrators.

If you have any questions, please let me know! I will do my best to respond as quickly as possible, but as I am new to this role I cannot guarantee an immediate response to everyone. If I don't respond in 24 hours, however, please just reply to your original comment and tag us and I'll give you an update on whether someone is following up.",positive,0.9783,positive,0.2240530303030303,02/16/2020

posts,"Do Not Become an RA/PL, Take a Stand. Sorry if we've been going on about this, but it needs to be said.

GT Housing and its treatment of its employees and residents has gone downhill for the past 4 years I've been here. We are belittled, disrespected, and gaslit by our Hall Directors, Area Managers, and other professional staff. None of our concerns are ever listened to, and there is no stability in the department overall. The few times we ask for support from them, we're ignored or pushed aside.

The emotional toll that it takes to be an SSM is insane, and we aren't provided proper support when dealing with it. The number of cases of sexual assault, depression, homesickness, coming out, break ups, break downs, roommate conflicts, and just general bad days that I've seen myself and my fellow RAs/PLs go through on nearly a daily basis is unparalleled to any other department except for Counseling. The only problem is, we aren't trained or compensated fairly for this kind of work. We are pretty much volunteer triage counselors, and it takes a fucking toll when you add in your other clubs, jobs, classes, and personal issues.

Not only this, but they have the audacity to remove half of the PL positions across campus, leaving one PL per floor to deal with double the residents, duty shifts, and general bullshit on their own. The ""additional"" compensation they're providing for double the work is a joke, and they're even banning SSMs from having any kind of other job on-campus or off-campus unless it's research.

I have loved this position like no other for the past 4 years, but I can't let this malpractice go unnoticed for any longer. If you're applying to become an SSM or considering returning to the position, please reconsider. **It isn't worth it. Period.** Putting in a decent number of hours a week at a part time job you enjoy would pay about the same while avoiding the stress and anger that we go through on a daily basis. The only way that anyone in Housing will ever listen to these issues is if they're starved of candidates and can't function, so please join in this good fight and spread the word.

I hope the extra money in your pockets is worth the loss of sanity and financial security of SEVERAL of your students.

Just know that you are the ones taking away a students wage that they may need to feed themselves. You are the ones shutting them off from every social, emotional, and academic outlet. You are the ones increasing the ALREADY stressful PRESSURE that every GT student feels every. single. day.

GT says they care. That they worry about our mental health. That they want us to succeed. But literally y'all just care about the money and that's just disgusting to me.

GT is only the institution it is today because of every single student that has step foot on this campus. Do better and give us some basic respect. It's laughable that we have to beg for that.

Your students are not your servants. Give us what we deserve.

Sincerely, a student who is not even a PL/RA but is severely saddened by your lack of humanity. Like holy sh*t, this is a new low.

For those of you who don't know, RAs in the past who have lived in 4-person rooms have been able to choose their roommates. However, our contract for next year only allows us to bring in 1 roommate. The other two rooms are open to anyone. Although there are many interesting topics circling reddit right now related to the Department of Housing, this is my main concern because I am nervous about my mental health in the future.

As we all know, this school can be very stressful at times. I absolutely love helping my residents and trying to build a strong community, but this job also adds a lot of stress. Getting to come home every day to a room full of close friends is very important to me. I am honestly very scared for my mental health next year without this support system in my life. 

The reality is that as upperclassmen next year, my other roommates will likely have a time ticket that allows them to self assign to my room (so everything should work out okay). But my question is why does the Department of Housing feel the need to add that stress into the position? 

Like I said, I love this position because I get to help other students in need. But I would like to voice my concerns so that we can all improve the housing experience in the future for all residents.",positive,0.9662,positive,0.14588669950738914,02/18/2020

posts,"The Executive Director of Housing and Residence Life | Campus Colleagues' Presentation &amp; Student Interview Session. Good afternoon all,

Over the next two weeks, we have the opportunity to interview with candidates for the position of Executive Director of Housing and Residence Life (ED of HRL). The ED of HRL position is the top-level position within the department and oversees the functionality of the entire department. Since September of 2019, this position has been vacant and the impact has been quite noticeable within the department and throughout the residential community.

The Department of Housing and Residence Life is at a critical juncture in its functionality as a service provider to the residential community. As a member of the ED of HRL search committee and as a fellow student, I'm asking for your assistance in what is likely to be one of the most important decisions made for the foreseeable future in regards to HRL. I can't emphasize enough how important it is that the right person is in this role to ensure that many of the issues faced by this year's residential community are ameliorated and future residents can live on a campus that proudly wears the name and reputation of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Below, the available sessions are listed and as well as a signup link to indicate your participation in the process:

ED of HRL Available Sessions
Candidate One Campus Colleagues' Presentation: Friday, February 21st | 9:30am - 10:30am

It has been a while since I've been back to campus but I've been keeping up through Reddit, Grad student friends etc. and I am honestly saddened and concerned about a few of the major issues plaguing student life at Tech, particularly mental health. I know firsthand the struggles you face here -- I took time off for anxiety and depression myself, and struggled to find the resources to help me cope at school. Since my time there, Tech's reputation has burgeoned both in terms of prestige but also academic rigor, but it is clear that improvements to student life and care have not kept up. I'm not looking to point fingers at whose fault that is, but I do want to see if we can help turn this around.

A few years out of school and with the benefit of hindsight and a broader perspective, some of us alums out in the bay area have been discussing what we can do to tackle real issues facing Tech today (besides just upping donations and getting the cold shoulder from the administration in response to emails and requests for a discussion).

I'd like to hear your perspectives here and am also looking for suggestions on the best way to gather data on the issues (surveys etc.) so we can start to put together something concrete.

I'm going to start off real broad here, so please sound off: 'Ma tech, where are you hurting, and what do you need?

posts,"Quick look inside Housing (and Campus Services in general). I‚Äôve been working closely with Housing as a student leader for the past couple years and want to provide my personal view on why things are so bad and what‚Äôs being done. A lot of what I‚Äôm about to say is still very much in the works and may change so take it with a grain of salt. This isn‚Äôt an official statement and I can‚Äôt provide a lot of sources right now, but I hope this helps clarify some things.

**How we got here in the first place**

We‚Äôre currently dealing with the aftermath of *years* of poor management, not just with Housing but the entire institute. The [fraud scandals](https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional/lax-oversight-allowed-high-paid-tech-officials-misuse-tax-money/KPhr38F6PupvqESYALWWIP/) a couple summers ago were the culmination of this. I‚Äôve only been a student since 2017, but it was clear from my interactions with various departments that there was (and still is a bit) a widespread attitude of ‚Äúwe‚Äôve done it like this for years, we don‚Äôt want to change‚Äù. This led to the lack of proper oversight allowing shady practices, as well as the stagnation of our student services. Some interesting things we‚Äôve discovered this year within Housing alone include:

¬∑ Maintenance has just been sitting on a *ton* of money for no apparent reason instead of, you know, actually maintaining residence halls.

¬∑ The software that you already use to register for housing is actually way more advanced than it seems, it was just setup improperly as a kind of quick hack and nobody has gotten around to fixing it. Seriously, the assignments team is doing a lot of stuff by hand that the existing software is already capable of doing if it was just used correctly.

¬∑ Housing‚Äôs internal communication has been horrendous, probably even worse than it looks on the outside. Policy changes are often communicated by word-of-mouth resulting in a long game of telephone where nobody really knows for sure what‚Äôs going on. Resident issues also aren‚Äôt communicated to the people in charge.

¬∑ On-campus housing is over capacity, but there really any long-term plans to address this. Residents are living in converted common areas and closets because we‚Äôre literally out of rooms. This is one of the factors behind the proposed North Ave changes (which are still super up in the air)

Since the scandal there has been massive turnover all around the institute, amplifying the shit show that many of our student services have become. Housing has been without a permanent director since last year (yes, a lot of things are happening with nobody at the wheel). Residence Life, the division of Housing most people interact with, is also vacant. Sheree is the interim director, but unfortunately, these interim positions do not have much power to make real long-term changes until they are permanently filled.

**What‚Äôs happening now**

Fortunately, Cabrera‚Äôs administration seems more willing to make the large changes we need and that is slowly trickling down. There is a great new VP of Campus Services who seems to be way more focused on reform based on student input. We (students &amp; admin) are in the midst of interviewing candidates for Housing/Res Life leadership that are in line with this mission. There won‚Äôt be a lot of tangible change for a little while as this is all sorted out, but the focus right now is establishing a better culture as well as planning long-term solutions.

So how does this actually affect *you*? Honestly, most of us will be long gone by the time a lot of the biggest issues are fixed. There is so much bureaucracy and red tape in a public institution ‚Äì especially after the scandals ‚Äì that things happen very slowly. We‚Äôre getting the short end of the stick, and I‚Äôm glad you guys are as mad as we are that we all have to deal with this. The state of campus services for the past 3+ years has just been unacceptable.

What is important is that we, and I mean *all of us*, are helping to establish the culture of Tech‚Äôs new administration. We need leaders that not only listen to students, but actively seek out and act on their feedback. We need people who aren‚Äôt afraid of making big changes, even if that means spending big money. We need greater transparency and accountability. I have the pleasure of working with many brilliant and passionate people, both students and administrators, that are focused on making this happen. There are people under all the bureaucracy who care, we are listening. Your student representatives (RHA, SGA) are constantly monitoring social media, collecting survey data, and interacting directly with the greater student body. Feedback is vital, it‚Äôs so much easier to sit down with the head of X department and push for change when we can point tTo angry reddit posts, emails, and survey feedback. 

Please, keep it up.

Keep telling us the problems you see. Post on social media. Email your student representatives (or go to their office hours). Fill out surveys. Make sure it gets to someone who can *and will* act on it. Follow up with them if you have to. Even if it‚Äôs already a known issue, more numbers = higher priority. A lot of the time it doesn‚Äôt feel like anything really happens, but here‚Äôs some examples of small changes in the right direction:

¬∑ More interactive and feedback-focused people at the top of Tech‚Äôs leadership (Cabrera frequently mingles with students, as a small example.)

¬∑ Student involvement in hiring decisions ‚Äì students are now being directly involved in selecting VP‚Äôs, Directors, etc. Recent search committee have been made up of a mixture of administrators and students.

¬∑ Staff that have been resistant to much needed change are being replaced. Maintenance, for example, is having their management restructured. Turnover is insane right now, but should hopefully smooth out over the next year or two.

¬∑ New residence halls are now in very early stages of planning. These won‚Äôt be completed for years, but there are actual contracts in place with design firms.

¬∑ ‚ÄúMajor‚Äù renovations to residence halls are coming soonTM. Scope and timeframe are up in the air, but I‚Äôve personally fought for new paint to go up this summer among other things.

I can‚Äôt really speak to what‚Äôs happening with RA‚Äôs/PL‚Äôs, that hasn‚Äôt been my area of focus. There are a lot of issues around what‚Äôs expected of them, and I do know that is a significant focus in the Residence Life interviews especially. We are working to close the huge disconnect between Housing leadership and the RA‚Äôs/PL‚Äôs actually on the front lines.

One last note: I want to stress the importance of involved student representatives. We‚Äôve set high goals and made big plans, but we won‚Äôt be around to see them through. As this generation graduates, we need new leaders to pick up the fight and keep holding the administration accountable. All too often, a group of students will start an initiative only for it to die a year or two later. Freshmen and sophomores, if you‚Äôre passionate about making things better for future students, *please* get involved. Don‚Äôt let admin scare you, they‚Äôre here to serve *you* and students have a lot more power than some people realize.

posts,"[WORKSHOP] INTRODUCTION TO ROBOTICS USING A DIFFERENTIAL DRIVE. GT IEEE is starting up a series of workshops for an Introduction to Robotics using a differential drive robot that will be built by the participants of the workshop. The workshop is divided into 2 parts:

Hardware: (Workshop 1) We build the Differential Drive using a Wooden Plank, Motors, Arduino, and Wheels

Software: (Workshop 2 to TBD)  We use that robot for Path Planning, Localization, Computer Vision, etc.

This is meant to be a crash course to simple robotics. This is in anticipation of the **IEEE Fall Hackathon, ""RoboTech 2020"",** where students will have to work on a robotics project (more details on this soon!). We are hoping to help students get acquainted with the different technologies - both hardware and software - that they might use!

We only have  limited spots available for these workshops. Moreover, we can only get a few Arduino kits that will be given on a first come first serve registration basis. Other students will have to purchase the materials on their own, or we could purchase them for you. However, the benefit of purchasing your own materials is that you get to keep the differential robot after the workshops and experiment on your own. Students using our kits do not get to do that. So come with your friends and split the cost and get to work on the robot!

Here's the Link to the interest form: [https://forms.gle/4S8erxNLLNkhJBbn9](https://forms.gle/4S8erxNLLNkhJBbn9)

posts,"Pimp My Crib (sheet): advice and recommendations to improve your midterm cheat sheets. Happy midterm season everyone! ü•≥ I am a fifth year ME student who tends to create crib sheets that are a *little* [extra](https://imgur.com/gallery/1hGBVRD). If you‚Äôd like to do the same, here are some ways to take your crib sheets from drab to fab in ~~no time~~ a bunch of time! 

1. **Use ultra-fine pens, not a pencil.**  I‚Äôm a left-handed person, so I don‚Äôt say that lightly. You can‚Äôt color-code with pencil, it won‚Äôt last as well, and mechanical pencil lead is too way too thick. If you want to write super small, you‚Äôre going to need pens that you likely won‚Äôt find at office supply stores. For reference, those pens usually have a nib size of 0.5mm-0.8mm. I typically use pens with nib size 0.05mm-0.3mm. Here are my three recommendations in order of price. (Formatting kinda messed up bc I‚Äôm on mobile. Sorry)

    1. **Pentel Arts Slicci 0.25 mm Extra Fine Gel Pen ($17 for 8 assorted colors):** These are the best bang for your buck. They generally last longer and are less delicate, as they are not felt tip. I would say the line width it puts out is more comparable to the 0.05 or 0.1mm pens I describe list next. I have only been able to find them on amazon. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003D7HFFU/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_utYsEbCVCFMER 
    2. **Sakura Pigma Micron Pens ($2-$3 per pen):** these are felt tip art pens and are much higher quality than the Pentel pens. I love using these pens, but they do tend to run out of ink pretty quick. They come in a good range of colors. They make a pen with a 0.03mm nib... I own one but would only suggest using it if you want to write a textbook on one sheet. I primarily use the 0.05mm and 0.1mm but will also use 0.2 and 0.3 if I‚Äôm not super pressed for space on my cheat sheets. You can buy these online, but I‚Äôd recommend going to a local art store (Blick‚Äôs or Sam Flax) to test them out and choose the ones that you like best. Those stores also have student discounts. 
    3. Copic Multiliner pens: ($3-$4 each) yeah so these are expensive and probably not worth the price. They‚Äôre basically the same as the Micron pens but nicer, longer lasting, and more expensive. They also start the nib sizes at 0.03mm. I‚Äôd only recommend buying their black pens that you intend to use heavily. You can buy them online, but again, I‚Äôd recommend going to the art store.
2. **Use fancy schmancy art paper,** not copy paper or, heaven forbid, notebook paper. Whether you took my pen advice or not, this does make a difference. The pens won‚Äôt bleed, and the paper will hold up well. I buy paper specifically made for pen drawings. It‚Äôs like heavy card stock, but the ink won‚Äôt spread or smear. My favorite is sold at Blick‚Äôs in midtown and is maybe $10ish for a 9x12 pad that will last you through college. You‚Äôll have to trim it to size. Canson Fanboy Comic and Manga Paper https://www.dickblick.com/products/canson-fanboy-comic-and-manga-papers/ 
3. **Write your notes in thin columns down the page.** Don‚Äôt try to write notes horizontally. You‚Äôll end up with equations side-by-side, and it‚Äôll be hard to follow the natural flow of your notes. Definitely don‚Äôt do the whole brick thing where you just have a million boxes/bubbles with equations that are hard to find. Write your notes in order, and give each equation its own line. Separate your columns by a distinct bold line. Try to make the columns wide enough to fit the width of your longest equation. If I have the space to spare, I‚Äôll divide the columns by one straight line. Otherwise, I will just snake the line along the end of each row. Ideally, you still want to maintain some semblance of a column. 
4. **Number, box, and highlight all your equations.** This will allow you to easily reference equations in other places on your cheat sheet. Boxing and highlights makes them easy to find. 
5. **Create section and subsection titles.** Seems minor but really helps find stuff. I write section titles large, bold, all-caps, and in a bright color. Underline or box it in if you feel so inclined. Basically just make it easy to find the different topics and their key ideas. 
6. **Color code words according to their meaning.** If it‚Äôs a definition, I‚Äôll write the word in blue and the definition in black. Equation names in pink, followed by equation in black. Set of rules/guidelines/numbered list? Title of list in orange, numbers in orange, and text in black. Examples should be titled as such in another color. Any particular extra important statements are written in red. 
7. **Only use one side each sheet of paper.** This is more of a personal preference than anything. If I‚Äôm allowed to have one page front and back, I‚Äôll use two sheets and only write on one side of each. I like to be able to look at the sheets side by side, but if you‚Äôre going to be limited on desk space or will be allowed multiple pages, stick to using both sides. 
8. **Scan your cheat sheet so you have a digital copy in case it gets damaged.** Do this especially if you get to reuse the cheat sheet on future tests. I once spilled a 4Loko on part of a Dynamics cheat sheet and the thing still smells icky sweet to this day. Also, don‚Äôt drink 4Loko. It‚Äôs trash. 
9. **Fill in your remaining space with example problems that may be similar to exam questions.** Honestly, this is if you have the time. It‚Äôs better to make sure you understand and can use the concepts than to just have a bunch of example problems to look at during the exam. If you don‚Äôt still understand the material, none of this will help that much. 
10. **Do not choose making your cheat sheet crazy fancy over getting sleep.** Get the most necessary stuff on the page and go to bed. Get at least 5 hours of sleep. You won‚Äôt do well if your brain is scrambled from no sleep. 
11. **Probably don‚Äôt try wearing those red/blue 3D glasses and writing a page in red ink and then blue ink over top of it.** I guess the idea is to be able to write two pages of notes on one page. I‚Äôve seen the idea float around the internet at some point. I‚Äôve never actually tried it, so maybe it could work for you. Mostly it makes me laugh. 

Cramming as much as you can on one page won‚Äôt be helpful if you don‚Äôt still have a good understanding of the material. With that said, making these intricate cheat sheets does help me learn the material. It‚Äôs not always good or necessary to fit all your notes in, but if you want to you probably can. I managed to fit an entire semester of ME2016 notes plus all the homework and practice problems on four sheets for the final exam and made an A in the class. The cheat sheets were easy for me to follow because I had made them and organized them pretty well, but it would probably be hard for anyone else to use. Those are shown at the bottom of this pic. I pretty much took that exam on autopilot with no sleep. Most of my other cheat sheets are never that extreme. 

If you made it this far, maybe you found something useful in all this, or maybe you just think I‚Äôm a little weird. I can confirm that second part as true. Life is more fun with a little weirdness. 

**As one last note, just remember that your performance at Tech does not define your worth. You are pretty damn awesome no matter what happens. NOTHING is more important than your wellbeing.**",positive,0.9992,positive,0.138518426018426,02/19/2020

posts,"Fair Fight U @ Georgia Tech - New Student Organization Promoting Voting and Voting Rights. ***If you read nothing else:*** *The registration deadline for voting in the GA primary is this coming Monday (Feb 24th) so please register to vote so your voice can be heard on election data. Click* [here](https://registertovote.sos.ga.gov/GAOLVR/welcome.do#no-back-button) *to check your registration or register to vote!*

**A bit about us:** We are a student chapter of Fair Fight Action. Fair Fight is an organization that advocates for your right to vote, and against recent efforts to suppress voting in states including Georgia. As a student chapter, our goal is to engage Georgia Tech around voting - making sure you‚Äôre registered and ready to exercise your rights on Election Day.

**What motivates us:**

214 polling locations (or 1 in 20) were closed in Georgia between 2012 and 2018. That‚Äôs the third-most of any state in that time period and accounts for \~13% of polling location closures in the US in that time frame. ([source 1](https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/voting-precincts-closed-across-georgia-since-election-oversight-lifted/bBkHxptlim0Gp9pKu7dfrN/)) ([source 2](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-locations-idUSKCN1VV09J))

1.4 million Georgia voters were purged from the roles from 2012-2018 -- so although someone was previously registered to vote, they may be unable to now. ([source](https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/voter-purge-begs-question-what-the-matter-with-georgia/YAFvuk3Bu95kJIMaDiDFqJ/))

Only 34.3% of voters between 18-24 in Fulton County voted in the 2018 election, the worst turnout rate of any age range in Fulton County (Source: Data from the Secretary of State).

**How to get involved?**

**You -** Check if you are registered in Georgia [here](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/voterDetails.do)**.** If you have not registered to vote yet, **do so** [here](https://registertovote.sos.ga.gov/GAOLVR/welcometoga.do#no-back-button) **by/before Monday 2/24 to be eligible to vote in the Primary elections.** You can also follow up on Instagram ('@fairfight\_georgiatech') where we will be posting voting deadlines/dates, current events about voting rights in GA, and about any events we have on campus.

**Your friends** \- Drop our above links in your group messages to help get your friends registered. Remember that yearly purges of the voter rolls have been happening - make sure your friends don‚Äôt get caught off guard on election day.

**On-campus -** Really like voting rights? You can help us get the word out around campus. Join our Slack [here](https://join.slack.com/t/fair-fight-u-gt/shared_invite/enQtOTI0MzYzNzAwNDQ5LTRiOWViZDBiZWVkNzZhN2JlYzJiOWU1OTE5MDBjYmFjMTRkMTViYTcxMDFlZDVhNzkzY2JiOTU1NmY1YTAzMDc) to stay updated on our efforts and get involved.

As the title says, I am deciding whether or not to pursue the conditional transfer pathway for Fall 2020. There are reasons why I do and why I don‚Äôt want to pursue it, and am quite conflicted. 

As a background, I am a freshman at Stony Brook University studying Computer Science. The program here is well regarded, and students seem to get good opportunities after graduation. I am also a NYS resident. While I love Stony Brook, I loved the feel of Atlanta and Tech‚Äôs campus when I visited. 

I would greatly appreciate any takes, advice, opinions, etc on whether or not I should pursue this opportunity. Why should I, why shouldn‚Äôt I? Anything from what it‚Äôs like to be a transfer student to what it‚Äôs like to be a computer science student. Social things, academic things, quality of life things, anything else. 

I won‚Äôt make a decision based solely on the replies here, but I hope to gain extra insights and perspectives on things I hadn‚Äôt considered before. i.e I would like as much food for thought as possible.
Please be honest (brutally so if needed) and I appreciate whatever time you put into your responses.

posts,"An open letter to SCPC.... Trevor Wallace? A Twitter/TikTok fad ""comedian""? Three years ago we had Kumail Nanjiani, Silicon Valley star and actual comedian with years of experience. Last year we had Jay Pharoah, a lesser SNL star, but nonetheless a funny-man with some experience in the biz and some really enjoyable impressions.

Three years ago the fall concert was Lil Dickey, a rapper with some recent success and an energy befitting of a college campus. In 2018 we had Rae fucking Sremmurd. We're still dorky Tech kids, so it wasn't the craziest concert, but it was still damn fun. This year's fall concert? Jesse McCartney, a Radio Disney popstar who hasn't had a hit since 2005. Nobody went.

The two big events students look forward to each year had depressingly lame bookings this go-round. Personally, I find Trevor Wallace less egregious than Mr. McCartney, but considering how much I pay for tuition, I would prefer the acts to not be weak as shit. Other Georgia universities don't seem have a hard time with it. Kennesaw State booked Megan Thee Stallion last fall. Why can't we do something similar?

I understand that funds might be tight, but I also know it doesn't take much to book performers that have some actual talent and are at least a little bit relevant. ""Beautiful Soul"" was a hit 15 years ago. We can do better than that.",positive,0.963,neutral,0.011628401360544213,02/25/2020

posts,"Georgia Tech Housing Update. ""The Department of Housing and Residence Life is making significant changes in how we serve our students.

Many of you have reached out through student leaders and during recent in-person meetings to share your concerns about the residential experience at Georgia Tech. We have heard your concerns, and I want you to know they are being addressed. After speaking with many of you, we realized not all the information we‚Äôve shared in various forums has made its way to you. This update provides as much information as I can about staffing, facility improvements, and student employment.

Moving forward, I will continue to host in-person meetings with small groups of student leaders and employees, and we‚Äôll add open forums for all students in addition to more regular communications like these.

## Facility improvements

We recognize that the physical environment of our residential facilities is of the utmost importance and that there is significant deferred maintenance and/or need for updated finishes. We have developed a three-pronged strategy to address these issues.

**Immediate Improvements**

* Last fall we began the      process of updating and improving all of our community use areas,      including but not limited to study rooms, shared kitchens, hallways,      community bathrooms, fitness areas, and commons rooms.  Some of that      work started during the winter break, including hallway flooring in Brown      Hall and the kitchens and common rooms in Woodruff.  You‚Äôll see a      significant amount of progress this summer, including new flooring, paint,      lighting, equipment, and furniture in 10-12 of our communities.

**Planning**              

* An East-Campus Renovation      plan. We intend to systematically renovate or replace all the housing on      East Campus. We are working with a consultant to help us strategize timing      and prioritization of that work.  Planning kicks off this week with      an anticipated delivery for late this summer.
* A full campus housing master      plan. Through this exercise we hope to ascertain what kind of housing      Georgia Tech should have as well as address longstanding concerns. Our      plan will outline the type of facilities we should have on campus while      considering student values, enrollment trends, and the off-campus housing      options. This planning exercise began in January and includes robust      student input with slated delivery of late Spring semester.

**Facility Condition Assessment Reports**

* During the last several      months we have conducted a full facility condition assessment report for      all of our housing. We will use this information and the recommendations      from the two plans outlined above to prioritize and plan for both minor      and major repairs for all of our residential facilities. Those capital      improvement plans will be finalized by the end of the semester.

## Changes to the student staff member position

You may have heard some discussion regarding student staff members in Housing. Please know that the Department of Housing and Residence Life and Campus Services have heard your concerns about changes to RA staffing and want to address them as quickly as we are able. We understand that the information has been confusing and we hope to provide some clarity here.

[We provided FAQs](http://w1.housing.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/student-staff/faqs_for_ssm_changes.pdf) to our student staff members last week in order to clarify what was changing, and why. A student staff member job description is [available here](http://w1.housing.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/student-staff/resident_assistant_conditions_of_employment.pdf). 

## Work order system updates

I know there are too many maintenance requests and the current process has not served students well. I have heard your concerns and I agree with them. We are making changes to update the system used for maintenance requests to improve timeliness, efficiency, and transparency.

We are also working on a new customer interface for the work order system to increase transparency and provide a better level of service. Once completed, students will be able to see the status of their work order at any time. Updating or changing technology can be a cumbersome process, but we hope to have the new solution in place by the fall semester.

Also, we are auditing our work order queue to ensure the data in our system is accurate. Among our early discoveries: a significant number of completed work orders had not been marked as closed in the system. This is a critical step in the process, and we are working to correct it with training and communication.

## Housing staffing updates

You may be aware that there have been a significant number of vacant leadership and professional staff roles in the Department of Housing and Residence Life over the past 18 months. We have interim leaders in the roles, but we are actively filling the vacancies as well. Since October, I have been acting as executive director for Housing and Residence Life. I am pleased to report we are in the final stages of the process for hiring the person who will fill the position permanently. We have some very experienced candidates in the running, and I expect the new executive director to begin this spring. Campus partners, students, and staff have been involved in the hiring process to ensure the best person is chosen for the role.

Secondly, we are finalizing the hiring process for the director of Residence Life. Sheree Gibson has been serving on an interim basis and we will soon be identifying the candidate for the position.

Other vacancies in the residence hall director staff group as well as the recent retirement of the associate director of Administration are expected to be filled this coming year.

While we acknowledge that the hiring process takes time, be assured that staffing is a priority and we are making every effort to fill vacancies promptly to support the needs of everyone affiliated with Housing.

On behalf of the Department of Housing and Residence Life, I want to thank you for your support for a strong residential experience. We are committed to providing a safe, convenient, and affordable housing option for our students, and we appreciate your patience as we work to implement these important changes. If you have concerns or questions, please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me at [campusservices@gatech.edu](mailto:campusservices@gatech.edu).

posts,"Cyclists are not pedestrians. As a bike commuter, I'd like to remind everyone to not be afraid to take your right-of-way when dealing with cyclists on the road. This includes:

* Taking your turn at a 4-way stop sign, instead of stalling when a cyclist arrives, even if it is not the cyclist's turn
* Proceeding as normal along a nonbusy major road, instead of stopping to allow a cyclist to turn into it (ex. CRC driveway) with the possible exception of rush hour navigation
* Proceeding as normal along a nonbusy major road and past a pedestrian crosswalk, even if a cyclist is waiting to turn into your lane from a road that happens to be next to the pedestrian--*keep going! Cyclists are not pedestrians!*

Taking one's right-of-way keeps traffic moving smoothly and efficiently, and even more so in the presence of cyclists, who have much slower accelerations. Giving up your right-of-way to a cyclist usually does more harm than good, especially to the cars behind you; cars coming the other way may not get the message, creating dangerous ambiguity; during non-rush hours, many cyclists are far more comfortable letting cars pass, then navigating an empty and much less dangerous road. 

Cyclists who overstep their right-of-way, or attempt to take a right-of-way when there is none, should be honked at. If they crash as a result of your legal, justifiable action on the road, this is their fault, and they deserve no sympathy. The behavior of cyclists unaware of traffic laws perpetuates driver hesitation to take right-of-way around cyclists, and should not be tolerated or encouraged.

Do not assume you are in the wrong because they are a cyclist, and they are ""special""--they're not! Cyclists are vehicles (usually)! *Cyclists are not pedestrians*!

PS: Cyclists who attempt to pass me, or ring their bells, when I'm waiting my turn at a stop sign: *fuck you*.",negative,-0.8557,neutral,0.018410528273809523,02/26/2020

I'm no stranger to hard work and competition, but I've heard that people get bogged down with work (or just become so enthusiastic about their own academic pursuits) that they become anti-social or get even more anti-social than they already were.  So yea, please tell me about social scene, generally how students are and personality, and if the intensity of the coursework is too much.

posts,"USG Coronavirus Update. Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,

News reports on the public health risk associated with coronavirus (COVID-19) have generated questions from members of the campus community who are understandably curious about how Georgia Tech is responding to COVID-19 internationally as well as how it is preparing for the possibility of increased risk in the United States. It is important to remember there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Georgia at this time, and risk of exposure in the U.S. is still very low.

To date, Georgia Tech has canceled its spring programs in China and South Korea and advised faculty to cancel any travel commitments to China. While the University System of Georgia (USG) will make overall decisions regarding summer programs and other travel at a later date, Tech has preemptively canceled its China Summer Program. Our Office of International Education is working with students who are negatively affected by these changes. 

On campus, Georgia Tech has developed an initial emergency response plan, and is conducting tabletop training exercises for the purpose of improved internal coordination and communication. Key Tech staff maintain close relationships with colleagues at the Georgia Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure we have the latest information and guidance.

We continue to encourage all members of the campus community to follow the same preventative strategies used during a normal cold and flu season: getting a flu shot, washing hands regularly, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when experiencing symptoms of illness. 

In partnership with the state‚Äôs Department of Health, the USG has updated its resource guide with the latest information concerning travel warnings and other guidance at www.usg.edu/coronavirus",negative,-0.2484,neutral,0.009090909090909094,02/28/2020

Please take the time to double check your 1098 and not blindly handing it to an accountant, turboTax, or H&amp;R block or whatever. I am a Spring 2019 graduate  student on a full out of state scholarship, and they decided to say my final semester of tuition was paid for Fall of 2018, even though it hit my bursar's account January 2019. This small time issues means I would get taxed a full semester of tuition as taxable income, instead of tuition. This small mistake would of cost me \~2k in taxes. Have sent numerous polite emails to the bursar's office asking for it to be corrected and they have only been rude and responses with documentation that even further proves they are incorrect. 

Please double check the values in box 1 and 5 of your 1098! If you are on scholarship there should be a  money amount in both boxes!
