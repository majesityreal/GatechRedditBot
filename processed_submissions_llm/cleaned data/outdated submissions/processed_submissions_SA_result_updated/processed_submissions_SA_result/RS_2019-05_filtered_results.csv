I'm planning on majoring in chemistry but is it also possible to double major in chemical engineering with the pathway program? I am aware that double majors would require a lot of work and I am willing to take the challenge.

I transferred in last year from KSU as a CompE major and my first year has been a struggle. I got hit hard early on while adapting which killed my grades and made it so my GPA is not super hot but not super cold. 

My next semester has been a lot more work with harder classes, lots of other personal things sandwiched on top of those, making it arguably my hardest semester of classes ever. I’m passing my classes with no issue but I want a higher GPA. GT has kinda just kicked me on my ass and made me feel terrible and I just have a lack of motivation to do any work for anything anymore. 

I need help with motivation and good resources to reach out to. I’ve been extremely lethargic about school the last two/three months and I want to find ways to better myself next year to be more successful and pull in a better GPA.

I also think that I would be a slightly bigger fish in the Liberal Arts pond, considering Engineering kids at Tech are the best of the best.

posts,"An open letter to this school. Dear Ma Tech:    

As my time with you comes to an end, there comes time to reflect on my journey with you.  When I came to your campus in middle school while my older sister was here, I instantly fell in love and knew I wanted to come here for college.  Fast-forward four years later, you welcomed me with open arms into your family.  Little did I know, however, how much I would treasure my time with you.  My journey here may not have been the smoothest with group projects, tough midterms, and late nights aplenty, but I am all the better for it.  You have helped turn a naive 18-year-old kid into a battle-tested problem solver ready for whatever the world throws at him.  You've also given me more than just an invaluable education.

You gave me resources to further my career and professional education through co-ops and internships

You gave me outlets to explore my interests in cybersecurity through elective classwork and extracurricular activity.

But most of all, you gave me an outlet to keep my passion for music and sports alive: the Georgia Tech School of Music.

When I first got to campus and auditioned for my first college concert ensemble, I assumed it would be just like high school: learn some new pieces, perform with some really talented musicians, and have a time to keep my mind clear of the worries of academics.  What I did not realize, however, was the strength of the School of Music community.  What started out as a simple membership in the Symphonic Band quickly became a gateway to something greater.  Through Symphonic Band, I met so many talented musicians and some of the coolest people on campus.  They successfully convinced me to join the Yellow Jacket Marching Band, which let me meet even more amazing people and forge new memories that I will cherish for a lifetime.  As a result, these experiences strengthened my love for you to the point where I am not ready to leave.    

Unfortunately, that time fast approaches.  So as I prepare to enter my final semester with you, I cherish every moment I have spent here.  From grinding out the last few lines of code for a programming project or the last few paragraphs of a written assignment, to cheering on the Yellow Jackets to some of their greatest victories, and everything in between, it has truly been an experience to behold.  Here's to more memories in one last push for glory before graduation as I prepare to close one chapter of my life and open another.

O Scion of the Southland, in my heart you shall forever fly.

Sincerely:
An ever-grateful son of Tech.",positive,0.9985,positive,0.18473727661227662,05/03/2019

Someone who wants to know what the fuck is going on.

I see a young man with potential...who wants to do something good with his life"" - Kingsman: The Secret Service

Dear new students:

Welcome to Georgia Tech!  In the next four or five years (or however many years it takes), you'll be going on one of the coolest and craziest journeys you've ever been on.  At the end of it all, you'll be ready to take on the world and its challenges.  The journey won't be easy, but you'll be all the better for it.  Therefore allow me, a soon-to-be-graduating senior, to give you some tips on not only how to survive, but thrive.

* **Don't overload yourself your first year**.  Take this time to find what it is that you love about Tech.  Use it to explore the city, the campus, and it's many extracurricular opportunities to find where you belong.  You may not have time to do this as the years go and courses get harder, so take a lighter (than normal for you) course load your first year to do so.
* **Don't expect the journey to be easy**.  College is an entirely different animal than high school and you're going to need to adapt quickly.  There may be some growing pains, but it's all to make you into a better person.  It's also the reason why Freshman Forgiveness exists for many classes; they may serve as a gut check for you but if you can learn from your mistakes, you will go far.
* **Take care of yourself**.  There may come a time when you feel down and unable to continue.  If this happens, be sure to reach out to somebody.  There are counseling resources available on campus, and while opinion may be divided as to their quality, they are there and it will ultimately be up to you to maximize their utility.  Otherwise, reach out to a friend or loved one, or take time for yourself away from academics.  Hell if you need to drop a class to relieve some of the stress, do so.
* **Be proud that you're here**.  You are at one of the most prestigious institutions of higher learning in the nation, if not the world.  You may feel that you're not qualified because your peers did more in high school or outside of school than you, but remember that you were chosen because of your potential for something greater.  If you're willing to put in the work, Georgia Tech will help you achieve that potential.
   * One way to show off your pride is to participate in many Tech traditions.  Wearing your RAT Cap faithfully, running the Freshman Cake Race, and participating in Midnight Bud are some of the best traditions you can carry on.

Prepare for some of the best years of your life.  You're going to meet many new friends and discover new opportunities while you're here.  Eventually, the time you spend here will open doors for bigger and better things once you graduate.  And remember:

""If you're prepared to adapt and learn, you can transform.""

Good luck and have fun!!",positive,0.9982,positive,0.2987482278929648,05/05/2019

posts,"Quick thought on graduating and working in industry. So I graduated back in December and have been working my new job since about February. It's been pretty great so far and I'm happy to have gotten out of school finally, but I got a nice reminder about 2 weeks ago about the advantages you get by having a degree from Tech. Our team got its first big deadline of the year in these past 2 weeks and it kind of hit us like a truck in that we're going to have to work really hard and possibly some weekends in order to hit it. What surprised me is how eerily similar this feels to a hell week - more specifically, the kind of pressure you're put under and the decisions you have to learn to make when you're subjected to that kind of stress. I'm grateful because getting the Tech degree actually taught me to survive and thrive in these high pressure situations by knowing how to properly prioritize and delegate, and as a result I'm having a much better time making a name for myself as the new guy who's only been at the job for 2 months but is getting shit done. Same goes for the other GT grads on my team, we all have and have maintained a really good reputation in the eyes of our management and the company as a whole, and I wholly attribute this to the mixture of technical competence, problem solving ability, and composure under stress that Tech instills in its graduates.     

We love to complain about Tech's downsides but it hasn't even been a year and I'm already so glad to be an alum of this school. Keep going at it! The payoff is worth it for sure.",positive,0.9694,positive,0.2340109427609428,05/05/2019

Today was a whole new level of upsetting and weird both the registrars and my academic advisor (AA) contacted\\emailed me telling me 1) I will not graduate and 2) to talk to my professor, something that just isn't possible, more on that later. The Area Coordinator for my specialization told me to ask for a project to do this summer. As has been the case the whole spring semester my prof has refused (either through negligence or malice) to respond to emails from me even when cc'd by my AA.

&amp;#x200B;

From my last post I got I'ms that I lied about having a 4.0 So I'm attaching my heavily redacted transcript. Also proof from Degree works that I did not graduate and my AA asking me to reach out to my prof.

&amp;#x200B;

So at this point it looks like I'm shit out of luck. I only really had the financial means to take class these last two semesters b\\c of an NSF grant through my GRA, but now thats gone and to even want to get another I'd need to be a full time student which is difficult with 1 class left (most profs want a 2 semester commitment minimum).

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the worst part, the same prof that i've been having issues with will be teaching this class for the foreseeable future. So I can't even try again with someone that would be neutral to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I came here to do research and switch my specialization to get a job in a new field. I've done both and without the money to try again here and way more money to make in industry while I'm still in my prime It is looking like my best option is to drop out.

Sorry guys, its not the way I wanted to 'Get Out' either.

\*\*\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\*\*\*

Thanks for all the supportive comments and suggestions on what to do next. One thing of note, I'd appreciate if people would try to avoid guessing my Concentration. I don't want to dox myself or my prof.  He may not have been very empathetic or helpful, but he was just doing his job, so I don't want any hate directed his way or my own should either of us be identified.

posts,"Aramark Dining Contract Update. Hello everyone!

We've had a lot of questions about what ended up happening with the possibility of a public dining situation on campus as well as the dining contract. Apologies for this not being posted sooner, I wanted to ensure that I was allowed to post this information and things were a bit crazy with finals. This is a long post, so bear with me.

Our ability to do anything with public dining was dependent on the decision regarding the Sodexo lawsuit over the RFP process that GT conducted this past year (see: [https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/lawsuit-targets-georgia-tech-handling-campus-dining-contract/W0UYbStCKm1KcOY6lavAqN/](https://www.ajc.com/news/local-education/lawsuit-targets-georgia-tech-handling-campus-dining-contract/W0UYbStCKm1KcOY6lavAqN/)  for more info on that). 

In late April, the Department of Administrative Services for the state of Georgia ruled to uphold a denial of Sodexo's protest surrounding the RFP process, leading to Georgia Tech moving forward with Aramark to finalize a contract (see:  [http://ssl.doas.state.ga.us/PRSapp/bid-documents/19503002019-RFP-SERVS-0006236410.PDF](http://ssl.doas.state.ga.us/PRSapp/bid-documents/19503002019-RFP-SERVS-0006236410.PDF)). 

During our discussions with GT, we brought up the fact that many students were still hoping to see something come out of the public dining resolution from this past semester. We were told that in the instance that Aramark's contract is not renewed (technically, it is a 1 year contract that has been guaranteed to be renewed 14 times unless Aramark fails to meet contractual obligations and expectations) that we could then come in and *potentially* make self-operated dining services happen. This is a very big if, and ideally we'd like to see Aramark come in and blow us out of the water. The biggest barrier we ran into this year with getting self-op implemented was that GT had already completed an RFP and made a decision when the resolution was passed (and even when it was written), at which point it becomes difficult for them to legally back out of anything.

With regard to the contract itself and Aramark's expectations, we asked that GT write into the contract expectations that Aramark work with the student body in order to ensure they are fulfilling student needs as well communicate effectively with those utilizing the dining halls. 

Some things this will include:

* They will be required to hire a minimum of 5 student ambassadors to
   * Explain meal plan usage/options
   * Foster relationships between the GT community and Aramark
* Student roundtables, held in the fall and spring semesters
* ""At the Table Events,"" during which Aramark will host a family-style meal with students in order to elicit feedback and opinions about on-campus dining
* Participation and Engagement with student organizations, including, but not limited to:
   * Student Government (no collusion, we promise)
   * Residence Life
   * Sustainability
   * Greek Life
   * If there are any others you would like me to propose or ask that Aramark work with, please let me know!
* Monthly participation in a Student Advisory Board that Aramark will help to build and coordinate and will include dining ambassadors as well as student representatives
* A yearly dining survey. The initial one, conducted in fall 2019, will serve as a benchmark and subsequent years will be compared to this. This survey will be used to gauge the needs and opinions of the student body as well as set goals for upcoming years
* Electronic monitoring of student engagement, which will be used to gauge the level of engagement with the student body as well as determine average student opinion on quality and overall satisfaction

Moving forward, we have been asked to help play a part in creating a committee to serve as advisers to administrators in the area of Campus Services as well as Aramark. If this is something you would be interested in, please send us a message and let us know!

Please note that this is just a start- while it may seem very sparse and vague right now, the terms of the contract will be reviewed yearly and there is definitely room for things to be added or changed. If you have any questions or input, let us know! While we didn't sit in on the meetings during which this contract was written, we would be more than happy to bring y'all's questions to administrators and plan to continue to work with them this next year to ensure that student begin to feel confident that they can get high quality food that meets their dietary needs. 

This will be my last time posting from the SGA Reddit account, as I can't hold my new SGA position and still be a part of PR- I'll be following this thread to answer any questions but after that point I'll be posting any updates from a personal account or having our awesome new PR committee members post on my behalf. If you have any concerns or questions at all, please still feel free to send us a message or tag us and we'll do our best to get back to you!

(You might remember someone posting a makeup survey to this subreddit a few months ago- that was one of us.)

Startup Launch is a competitive 12-week on-campus startup accelerator by CREATE-X that provides the resources and funding to launch projects into viable businesses ([https://create-x.gatech.edu/](https://create-x.gatech.edu/)). Myshadow has already been accepted into this summer's batch, but we need one more co-founder for our team to participate.

Requirements:

1. Full-time availability from Monday, May 13 to Friday, August 2 including attendance of all Tuesday sessions from 9 AM to 6 PM
2. Eligibility to enroll in a GT summer class (non-GT students are fine)
3. Entrepreneurial passion and willingness to learn about the makeup industry

If interested, please email Anisha at anishamatharu \[at\] gmail \[dot\] com ASAP (preferably by this Saturday at noon) with a short note about yourself and your availability. Feel free to send questions her way too.

   * are they understanding?

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought was to try to use a Pi, but apparently they only have one to two display outputs - I'm pretty determined to get four working, and would rather do it all with one custom board than by buying four Pis and syncing them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know nothing about circuits right now, but am willing to learn and buy parts/get something printed/whatever the process is. Can anyone point me in the right direction? I don't even know what sub to post questions for this in, haha.

posts,"State St and 10th St: Two lanes or one?. State Street coming from 14th Street, when you get to the intersection of 10th Street next to the Papa John's. The road is really wide right there. There are no painted white lines. Is it supposed to be two lanes? Is one of the two lanes intended for turning in one direction or the other? I normally hug the middle line, since I am going straight and that allows others to immediately turn right, but people pull up next to me and then go straight, I guess assuming that I am turning without my blinker on. Does anyone know what the situation is?
