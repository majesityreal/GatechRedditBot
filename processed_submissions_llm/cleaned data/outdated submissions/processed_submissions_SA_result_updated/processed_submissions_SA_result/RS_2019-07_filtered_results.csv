posts,"Intend to Transfer Summer 2020. Need Advice or Information. I’m planning on transferring to Georgia Tech for Computer Science in the summer of 2020, which means I’ll need to apply in December after fall classes end. It will be right before Spring, but I’ll assume I can put the classes I’m signed up for in Spring on my application as “in progress.”

I will have 60 credit hours at University of North Georgia fully completed, and 75 total if I include the Spring in-progress classes. I’m applying for Summer because I believe it will be a little less competitive compared to the influx of high school seniors in the fall and because it will be easier to find an apartment.

Overall GPA: 3.89
UNG GPA: 3.97
Math &amp; Science GPA: 3.92

These are subject to slight change over the upcoming semesters.

I’m taking Calculus II right now as a summer course and will be taking Computer Science I, Physics II, and Calculus III in the fall.

The Oakwood campus only offers 3 Computer Science related courses, so I’ve chosen to wait until right before I transfer to take them.

I have a few extracurriculars, but the internship I was going to secure ghosted me after a change in funding.

I’m concerned that I’m going to be denied and not have anywhere to go considering that my current school does not offer any other classes after this. Tech has been my dream school since I was a child and I want to do anything possible to make my place there.

Does anyone have any advice as far as my essays, anyone I could contact, or things I could do to further ensure that I land a spot? I can provide more info if asked, but it is quite a lot to type out.

There’s around fifty other interns, with a few of them also being from GT, but everyone is scattered throughout the buildings. However, I sit by 5-6 other interns that are all from UF.

Last week, I got pulled aside by a full-time employee and was told that our “group” has already made a name for being loud and not doing work. The other interns like to sit in a circle and talk for most of the day. None of us are really assigned a ton of work, so we usually finish it within a few hours, and there’s nothing to do but look bored on the computer. I don’t sit and talk nearly as much as they do, but I do have a bad habit of sitting on my phone sometimes, which I know isn’t a good look at all for an intern. I’ve been trying to do the normal “help, I don’t have any work at my internship” things - do personal projects, learn new things, etc. But, it’s still hard to focus, and I understand why the full-time employees are all annoyed.

After taking some networking classes I have now sent out connection messages to several GTRI HR members and researchers in my field in hopes to make a personal connection, but I really would love to know if there is more I can do.

I really just wish to work in the DoD while staying in the heart of Georgia. I have had offers from companies like Lockheed and Raytheon but they wish me to relocate to military bases far away from home and far from civilization. Currently there are three fantastic openings at GTRI in my field of : a Jr EE, a Jr. Antenna and Radar engineer, and am image and signal processing engineer (my specialty).  All three I am once again ""under review"" but like the countless other times I have applied I feel that status won't change for weeks till I just get a rejection email.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really hoping I can connect and meet with one of the people on LinkedIn so I can at least get their advice or have them look me over and tell me what might be what is causing GTRI from turning me down. Even advice on just making myself stand out would be wonderful.
