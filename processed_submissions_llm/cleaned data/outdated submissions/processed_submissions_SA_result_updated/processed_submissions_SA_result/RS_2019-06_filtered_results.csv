I am an incoming freshman for Fall 2019

I know Phase 1 is for returning students and Phase 2 is for everyone else, but I was wondering if, after Fall semester, I'll be considered a returning student.

Is there any way for me to talk to someone about this? My family has to plan this months in advance.

I've just finished my undergraduate CS degree at GaTech and I've been accepted to the MSCS program. I'm deciding between it and going to work in industry.

Is it reasonable to complete the MSCS in 1 year including a summer? I'm thinking about pursuing the course option as I've heard research can take a varying duration depending on the professor.

Would I be at a significant disadvantage if I pursue the class option instead of the project or thesis options? I'm not particularly interested in doing research at a university; I just want to get the knowledge and degree to go pursue ML work in industry. I'm also not interested in the OMSCS as I want to complete the degree quickly rather than working while pursuing the degree.

posts,"On-campus job into which I got accepted fell silent on my end. What should I do?. So in late April, I got an acceptance for an on-campus job in my major's outreach department, to which I gladly accepted. After they conducted and I passed a background check, they sent me this past Wednesday a verification form that I have to turn in in-person and an online course that I had to have completed by today. 

The only problem is that I'm currently OOS as I didn't expect that I'd have to turn in something on-campus — I was intending to wait until I get a start date to come back to the campus — and I don't have access to this course. Since it's a bit hard for me to simply drop everything and get a flight to Atlanta to turn in a form before the course's due date, I inquired on the same day to the coordinator for this outreach position as to what's going on with the course and if my current situation regarding turning in this form is preventing me from accessing this course and getting a start date. However, I did not receive any update on this matter, and since that Wednesday, I've tried the following measures to get an update:

* Emailing the coordinator twice more.

* Calling the coordinator twice more.

* Emailing HR for the college.

* Calling HR for the college.

And all of these communication attempts fell flat.

So, with this situation in mind, is there anything else I can do to reestablish communication on this matter/is there anything that I did wrong on my part? Or should I cut my losses and suspect that I've been let go? And I'm sorry if I sound desperate, it's just a job that I really wanted to have.

&amp;#x200B;

You're invited to participate in a virtual reality study where we'll be examining how this new tech might be used to educate viewers about various social issues. This study is being produced by Harmony Labs with Principal Investigator, Dr. Sun Joo (Grace) Ahn, and will take place during May and June in New York City and Atlanta.

The experiment will consist of three parts: participants will take a short 15 minute online survey, followed one week later by an in-person session at a Harmony Labs workspace where they will watch a 10 minute short film and answer a short questionnaire, wrapping up one week later with another 10-15 minute online survey to complete the process.

Your participation will be extremely valuable in helping us understand this new technology and its social effects. Participants must be at least 18 years of age and cannot wear eyeglasses. Each participant will receive $20 in gift cards for their contribution to the study, which we expect to take approximately 60 minutes of their time. Participation in the study is completely voluntary and can be stopped at any time.

posts,"Best way to transfer in my case. The title basically sums up what I'm looking for. I need advice on the best way to transfer over to GT as an engineering major since I have a bit of a dilemma going on.

* Next fall, I will be starting my first year at uGA. After that semester, I will have more than 30 credit hours (including AP credit)  so that I could apply as a transfer for Fall 2020.

* I got Arts and Sciences transfer pathway when I applied to GT (since I applied as a Chemistry major for whatever dumb reason).

The dilemma is this: 

1. I could follow Arts and Sciences pathway which is a 100% guaranteed transfer as long as my GPA is above 3.3. However, I will have to stay in College of Sciences and won't be able to major in Engineering. I would be able to apply for a change of major, but I heard this is not guaranteed for transfer students. 

2. I could also just apply as an engineering major. However, I won't be guaranteed a transfer, and if I don't get in, I won't be able to use Arts and Sciences since it is only available for Fall 2020.

If anyone has any knowledge and experience about changing majors that would greatly help. I heard certain majors like Mech are notoriously hard to both apply to and change to.",positive,0.9413,positive,0.23909632034632036,06/03/2019

1) I've done a ton of research on the CS department (both on the GT website, scrolling through Reddit, etc), but none on EE, so would anyone mind shedding some light on what the EE department is like?

2) I don't have a ""favorite"" in software or hardware– like, I think both are cool, but my interests lie in the interactions between the two. I've heard negative things about the CmpE department here, however :( I'm currently stuck between an EE degree with a CS minor or a CS degree with Devices + SysArch threads; which option would focus more/allow me to hopefully get a career with software/hardware interactions?

3) I've seen many stories from CS students (in general)  getting internships and job offers after grad; is it easy (with a reasonable amount of work, ofc) for an EE to get these opportunities?

4) Perhaps the most important thing: I already know I like CS, but is there an EE-esque class I can take within my first 2 years that can help me determine whether I should make the switch? Time is kinda of the essence, bc my scholarship only covers 4 years and OOS rates are not fun :(

Im planning on being AE but idk if that will change (even if it does I will 98% stay in engineering of some kind).

posts,"Co-op Income Affecting EFC. Has anybody ever had an issue with their co-op earnings affecting their EFC? On the financial aid website, it says it shouldn't affect EFC at all. I emailed the financial aid office and I was told that it's normal for it to affect your EFC so either the website or my advisor is wrong. 



This is frustrating. My co-op made my EFC 10k higher than the last few years. Every other part of my FAFSA was exactly the same. Because of this, I lost 10k in scholarships I had for the past few years.
