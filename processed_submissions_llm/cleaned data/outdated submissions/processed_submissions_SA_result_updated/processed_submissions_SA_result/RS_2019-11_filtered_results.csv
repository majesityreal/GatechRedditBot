posts,"depressed freshman. hi y’all. this might be misplaced but i need somewhere to vent and i don’t really have anyone here to talk to. 

so i’m basically having a really rough first semester here. i have like 0 friends and the ones that i do have are more like acquaintances than actual friends. just people i sit next to in lecture, am in a club with, etc. i don’t really hang out with anyone or go out ever.  

i’m really struggling to make good friends here. i think a lot of this comes from the fact that i’m not really involved on campus. i didn’t want to overcommit myself in the beginning so i ended up under- committing, and now i have a ton of free time (which is mostly spent wallowing/being sad and alone rip).  i’m in 2 clubs, but both of them only meet ~ 1 hour each week, and it’s really difficult to develop meaningful friendships with people you only see that often. and i don’t have the confidence to suggest hanging out with anyone outside club meetings. this is another problem, which i’ll expand upon: 

i am extremely insecure. i wish i could not care about what people think about me, but i care. a lot. this makes it extremely difficult for me to initiate things with people because i’m deathly afraid that they aren’t interested in my friendship and i’ll embarrass myself by asking them to hang out. and not having friends here is just exacerbating this insecurity and fear of rejection. i start to question my worth as a person. i start to think, if i was attractive, if i was funny, if i was likeable, that i would have friends already, and i must not be any of these things because i don’t have friends here. 

these thoughts have gotten kind of extreme recently, and i’ve started to have disordered thoughts about food again (i had an eating disorder for the majority of my senior year of high school). im trying my best to fight these thoughts but they have been affecting my eating patterns recently. i can also feel my social anxiety starting to creep  back. this is something i dealt with more towards the beginning of high school, but i kind of grew out of as i established really good friendships and became more confident in myself. now i feel like i’m back to where i was freshman year of high school: frozen. i put so much pressure on each interaction that i have with people, to the point where i can’t just relax and be myself. i’m not truly comfortable talking to anyone because all i can think about is them seeing all of the imperfections that i see in myself. 

i also kinda feel like a failure because i’m not doing great in school. being smart has always been a large part of my identify and a source of confidence for me and recently i feel like i’m losing that, too. i’m not doing terribly, but it looks like i’m going to get a B in at least one of my classes and it’s really bothering me. i feel like, since i have nothing else going on, i should at minimum be succeeding at school. i’m in 12 credit hours, 2 low-commitment clubs, and  have no social life. i have no excuse to be doing poorly, and yet i am. 

all of these things combined are really taking a toll on my mental health. and it sucks because, while i’m going through so much, i don’t have anyone here to talk to about it all. and i don’t want to burden my home friends who are all trying to enjoy their college experiences. it also doesn’t help that i live on east and can hear the parties going on right now and know that everyone else is out having fun with their friends while i’m sitting in my room crying (this has basically become my thursday/friday night ritual lmao). 

i don’t now what to do or where to start. i really want to join some higher commitment clubs (like at least 4/hrs a week or so) so i can find a good community and make friends, but it feels like most of them aren’t recruiting anymore and there’s nothing i can do at this point in the semester. if anyone has tips here or club suggestions/knows clubs that are still recruiting, i would REALLY appreciate it. 

i don’t really know what the point of this post is. i think i mostly just want to vent because i don’t have anyone to talk to. i’d also really like to hear from anyone who has gone through something similar or has advice about what to do in my situation. sooo IF anyone here has been through something similar and has advice about what they did, or any encouragement if things got better, i would REALLY appreciate it. and if anyone has been to GT counseling and can share their experience/whether or not it was worthwhile, i’d also appreciate it, because i think i might be in serious need of their services. or if anyone has club recommendations i’d appreciate that too.

if you read all of this, you’re actually an angel and i really appreciate you. even if you just read some of it, i appreciate you, too. happy halloween ;)",positive,0.9993,positive,0.14526254138018843,11/01/2019

This is a **mock** exam to prepare you for the midterm in two weeks. Please read the following instructions before starting:

&amp;nbsp;


Good day student,
If you are wearing a baseball cap, please remove it or turn it backwards. Food and drink are not allowed during the final exam, with the exception of water in a clear bottle. If your water bottle has a label, please remove it now. All unauthorized belongings must be safely secured under your table. This includes pencil cases and wallets. If you need to access personal items during the exam, raise your hand and ask a TA for permission. Bags must be closed and placed under your table so they are not blocking the aisle. [If you look down and your bag is next to you, please move it under the table on the front leg.] Only pens, pencils, erasers, and special materials that are permitted can be on your desk. If you have a question, raise your hand and a TA will assist you.

&amp;nbsp;

Place your buzzcard on your desk and write your GTID as well as your GT Username on the blanks provided. Do not turn over the test yet. Sign the honor code statement on the bottom of the page. Once you leave the classroom, you may not return. The length of this exam will be 55 minutes. A clock has been displayed on the projector for your convenience. If you decide to exit out of reddit while others are still writing, please leave quietly through the back, and hand your test to the TA by the door.

If you got in, congratulations! We're happy to have you, and go Jackets! It'll be hard, but you can do it! I believe in you!

If you didn't, it's okay. I've been there, twice. Meanwhile my twin sister, who didn't even want to go to GT, got in as a freshman. It hurts, and it's okay for it to hurt. But you'll live.

Maybe it's a new lifelong friend, maybe it's a class you never knew you wanted to take, maybe it's an experience you've always wanted to have. Either way, it's there, and it's waiting for you. You got this!

Just remember guys, even if you don't get it this time, you can always try again for a different semester. It will all work out, I promise. It took me a few tries and many hours of crying, but I made it, and I've loved and enjoyed my first semester here this fall.

I can't say enough how glad I am that I got in GaTech which has been my dream school since 2 years and a half ago when one of my prof's  mentioned GaTech.

And so many kind students here gave me a lot of good advice when I asked questions on this sub, I am extremly happy that I became a part of this family!!!

So, now I am looking at the course flowchart for ChBE. I have been already at my CC for 2.5 years and I will end up with 80 credits, and hopefully get 60 transfer credits. But due to pre-req's that my school didn't have, now I am looking at 6 more semesters(3~4 years? With internship/co-op's?) I am not a traditional student and really wanted to graduate before 30 but I think that's not going to happen LOL😂😂😂 *laughs insanely*


So it looks like I have to take ...

*Semester 1: CS1371, ChBE 2100

*Semester 2: ChBE 2130(Thermo I) and VhBE 2120(Numerical Methods)

*Semester 3: ChBE 3130(Thermo II), ChBE 3200 (Transport Phenomena I)

*Semester 4: ChBE 3210(Trandport II), ChBE 3225 (Separation), ChBE 4300 (Kinetics)

*Semester 5: ChBE 4510 (Proc.&amp;Prod. Design), ChBE 4515(Safety), ChBE 4200 (Unit Ops)

*Semester 6: ChBE 4520 (Capstone), ChBE 4411(Process cont.), ChBE 4412 (Process  cont. Lab)


So I wonder if I can get permission from the department to take courses concurrently? Anyone who has done that? Or is that absolutely impossoble to do so?  

I am going to ask about it at FASET if I can go there (I am OOS), but I'd like many pieces of advice. Thank you guys!",positive,0.9799,positive,0.2606060606060606,11/02/2019

posts,"You Kids had it Easy. Tell you kids, back in my day, we had it so rough... or so much better, i can't tell anymore. anyway, every day, we would wake up at 2 in the morning and go to the table for breakfast. we all lived in a closet, you see, so it was one room. and we would ask, me and my 64 brothers and 27 sisters, ""what's for breakfast momma Tech?"". she would smack us all with a shoe and say ""phat Ls"". and if we complained and said ""but we had phat Ls yesterday"" - because we had phat Ls every day - she would smack us all five times with a shoe and say ""tough its all we can afford. i'm trying to feed a family of 93 with just half a silver buckington"", a silver buckington was about the same as half a penny back in the day. then we would head to school. we met up with the poly kids from down the road, and walked the 1674 miles to CULC. on the way to school, we had to walk up freshmen mountain so tall it extended to outer space. when we got to the top of the mountain, we would see the uga boys on their fancy bikes - which they dont make like they used to, and we would race them down the mountain. then, when we got to school at 4 in the morning, the dean would come up to us and say ""you bloody kids are late"", then he would smack us all with the cane 10 times and tell us we had 7 years of detention. then, we went to class, and mr bud peterson would say ""ok line up kids"", then he would spank us each 60 times, then hit us each with the cane 40 times each. then it was 7 at night and we had to walk home. then, when we got home, we'd ask ""whats for dinner momma T?"", and she'd smack us each 50 times with a pan and say ""physics 2"". and if we complained, she would smack us each 100 times with a broom and say ""im trying to feed a family of 154 on just one islet sliver, just you wait until your dad gets home"" - now an islet silver was worth about as much as a grain of sand. then, when our dad got home from his job at the soot factory, he would hit us all 180 times with his belt. if we had been naughty, we would hit us all another 600 times. then, at 1:58, momma would say ""ok time for bed"". then, we got into our potato sacks, and she would hit us each with a shoe 8 times before we went to sleep. on saturdays, we went down to uncle billie's farm to work. we would have to walk 345 miles to the bus stop, then catch the route 4 bus for 56 stops. we would get on the bus and pay our fare of 3 teddy roses - now a teddy rose is worth about the same as a flake of skin. then, if the ticket inspector came to us, he would hit us all 4 times with his baton. if any of us had lost our ticket, we would hit us all 10 times again and throw us off the bus and we had to walk the rest of the way. when we got to the farm, uncle bob would drive to the gate in his tractor, hit us all 780 times with his crowbar, and tell us to get in his trailer so he could drive us to the farm house. then, we had to plow the fields with a toothbrush in the blazing summer heat - now, they dont make summers like they used to, so it was about 1345.4 degrees spencer, or 67 degrees centigrade using your new-fangled metric system. then, we would have to milk the cows - now, they dont make cows like they used to, so each cow weighed about 459 hog's heads, or 3.2 tonnes in your new-fangled metric system. if you touched a cows udder, it would kick you and you would die, so you had to be really careful when you milked the cows. then, when we were done, uncle bob would say ""ok kids time for your pocket money"". he would give us each 9 copper jemimahs - which are worth about one political promise each - and beat us each 6 times with his tractor before we left. on sundays, we would meet the poly boys and go down to the river - now, they don't make rivers like they used to, so this river was about as wide as the whole of america, and as deep as the marianas trench, and it was filled with liquid tungsten. we would play by the old oak tree near the river, climbing on it and building tree houses and such. now - they don't make trees like they used to, so this tree had a trunk as thick as a city, and was tall enough that the branches on the top could scrape the moon. one day, little buzz fell from the top of the tree. when he hit the ground, the only bit of his body we could recognise was his left eyeball. we picked up all his bits and rushed him to the doctors surgery. dr clough said ""oh its just a scratch little buzz dont worry pop a plaster on it and you'll be right"" and he gave little buzz a plaster and a lollipop and he was ok. after we finished playing by the river, we would go into town and get some candy. now, back in the day, you could give the shopkeeper one bronze winglet - which is worth about as much as a ciggarette butt - and he would give you the entire stock of the store. so we would go and get our candy, and we'd go into the town square and eat it. now, we didn't have any of your fancy food laws back in the day, so there was all kinds of stuff in our candy. bleach, rust, bones--you name it. so we would always get a little hyper after our candy. one day, when we were hyper, we went up the mr mccamish's car, the only car in the town, and touched it. as we touched it, we saw dad storming down the street holding his belt. ""you kids, having fun while i work all day in the soot factory just so you can have grilled water for tea every night, i oughta smack you all"". we were sure he was going to smack us, but then he said ""no, i got a better idea, ill take you to see mr groseclose, he'll set ya right"". now, dad had told us about mr groseclose. mr groseclose was a veteran from the great war, where he got a really bad injury, but we never knew what it was. dad walked us all down to the pub, and we saw a left testicle propped up on a pegleg. ""mr grose,"" said dad, ""i have some kids here who need a good whooping"". then, mr gross picked up the entire pub, and hit us each 4006 times with it. then, dad said ""right, i gotta go back to the soot factory, you kids run on home now"". now, by now it was 1pm, which meant it was curfew. while we were walking out of the town square, we heard a man shout ""oi you bloody kids, its curfew"". we turned around and saw the constable holding his baton. he hit us each 160265 times with his baton, then put us in gaol for 60123865 years. now - they don't make gaols like they used to - this one had 5 mile thick steel walls, and a single hole in the top let in some light. we were in there for about 13526 years, until mum baked the constable some cardboard pie so he would let us out. then, she hit us all 1292 times with a washboard, and grounded us for the rest of our lives. so don't you come complaining to me about nonsense like not having tv while hiking 25 miles to Tech.",negative,-0.9181,positive,0.059361009361009354,11/03/2019

posts,"Hey can we close our fucking campus?. I think this is negatively affecting campus life, at least when it comes to random people showing up and protesting extremely outdated beliefs about homosexuals and abortion. My issue doesn’t lie with what these people are saying, moreso their methodology. These people do not have the right to walk up to our students to harass them about their beliefs/orientation/sexual habits NOR the right to display very explicit pictures of dead fucking infants. Are you kidding me right now? How is this legal and why should encouraging an environment like this in any way healthy? Being subjected to the name-calling, body-shaming, sex-shaming, moral-shaming is not what I came to this campus to achieve. I understand the reason to have a space to allow people to express their believes, but there are boundaries.

EDIT: All y’all crying about free speech are still missing the point. I do not want to limit what they are saying, I want to limit the dead baby pics, thanks!

FINAL EDIT: You don’t need to be graphic to make a point. This protest is unnecessary for that simple fact, and highlights an issue regarding protesting here and it’s effect on our student body. If you have to resort to shock to make your point, it’s not a very valid argument.

It is with great sadness that I write today to inform you of the death of Dennis Jones, a Ph.D. student in Materials Science and Engineering from Signal Mountain, Tennessee.

News like this can be devastating to a close-knit community such as ours. Anytime someone, particularly a young person, passes away, there are a range of emotions to be addressed and questions to be answered. Please remember that Georgia Tech offers multiple services and resources in support of the community, and I urge you to take advantage of the services that are available.

Grief counseling and mental health support for students is available through the Center for Assessment, Referral and Education (care.gatech.edu). Staff and faculty may find support through the Employee Assistance Program at hwb.gatech.edu/eap.

posts,"To the protestors on campus today:. This is not the right way to go about changing people's minds.

With all the respect in the world for the freedom of speech and the voicing of opinions--no matter how controversial they may be--if your goal was to get people to better understand your position and perhaps even sway them onto your side, then you have done an objectively poor job.

If your goal was simply to upset a student population and cause outrage, then I commend you; for, there was an air of negativity and hostility on campus today that I have not experienced in quite a while. You definitely made your point and dampened the spirits of many a passerby student.

If your intention was in fact to change the minds of a largely pro-choice student population and convince them to adopt a pro-life perspective or even to be more understanding of your position, then let me first explain to you why you have failed, and offer some advice for how to cultivate more productive discourse that does not result in hostility or anger:

First, by displaying posters in the center of campus including a large projector showing footage of abortions, you have made engagement in this conversation virtually unavoidable, including to those that did not want to be involved in it in the first place.

Next, seeing these graphic images triggers an emotional response in many people that makes it highly unlikely for them to separate feelings from rationality, which is not conducive to a productive conversation.

Finally, when faced with media that aggressively supports a message that appears antithetical to their beliefs, the vast majority of people are likely to feel antagonized, which results in them doubling down on their position, not wanting to engage in any sort of conversation, and feeling justified in retaliating against the party they feel is attacking them.

Obviously, none of the above is good for civil discourse or productive debate. Instead, may I recommend the following:

1. Take a note from the groups on the Skiles walkway. Instead of utilizing imagery for shock value, politely ask people to engage in the conversation by handing out flyers or holding a poll. This way, those that do not want to participate in the conversation are not forced to.
2. Share your point of view, but be prepared to listen to others' as well. You cannot expect to convince others of your position if you are not open to also understanding the positions of others. Present facts and statistics, but keep debate civil. Unchecked emotion has ruined many a good debate.
3. Be human. It is easy to forget that behind the disturbing images and shock-value media are real human people that hold real opinions. If you decide you want to openly display an opinion, have the courage to stand there and defend it instead of hiding behind posters and video projectors. If you want to change people's minds, you can't be afraid to actually *engage* in debate.

I sincerely hope that you find this post helpful and reconsider the methods with which you aim to change people's minds.",positive,0.9516,positive,0.07170965608465607,11/04/2019

You may be aware of yesterday’s inadvertent disclosure of protected student academic data. A news item about this incident is available in the Georgia Tech News Room

While this incident appears to have been the result of human error, it raises important questions about our existing systems, policies, and practices regarding data governance and access. We are conducting a thorough investigation into this incident to understand its causes and consider any immediate preventive measures that may need to be put in place. We will also investigate existing vulnerabilities throughout the Institute, and will make any necessary changes to ensure protected information is available only to those individuals who have a legitimate business or academic need. 

We will keep you informed about what we learn and what improvements we intend to make.

posts,"@ARDUINO GODS OUT THERE, will buy you lunch, boba, or venmo you for help. I've spent the past week living at the HIVE trying to get the stupidest thing to work on Arduino and i stg I'm going insane. If you can help me i will be eternally grateful and will compensate you with food.

I need to connect 3 accelerometers (ADXL345) onto one Arduino Mega so that the Arduino can collect data from all 3 accelerometers simultaneously. I can't use I2C with different addresses assigned to each accelerometer because the accelerometer can only be used with 2 unique factory set addresses while I have 3 accelerometers.

I'm currently trying to use 6 N-channel MOSFETs to control the 3 SDA and 3 SCL data streams (one SDA and one SCL stream per accelerometer)so that only one accelerometer's data is being sent to the Arduino at a time but i'm having trouble initiating the accelerometers and my code seems to be stuck in the first iteration.

Can someone meet me in person and help me troubleshoot my code? Maybe I placed accel.begin() in the wrong place to initialize each accelerometer? I have 2 codes where I tried initializing the accelerometer in void setup and in void loop. I've also only been testing with 2 accelerometers but i need 3 in the end.

I know using MOSFETs is a very unusual approach so if anyone has different a code and wiring that also collects data from 3 accelerometers simultaneously I that would be super useful to me too! I just want this seemingly very simple project to work... I've posted about this on Arduino's forum too but i thought since i *am* at a institute of technology there's gotta be someone who i can meet in person to get help from.

Today I asked Professor Raheem Beyah, vice president for Interdisciplinary Research and expert in cybersecurity, to lead an effort to investigate existing vulnerabilities in data access across the Institute and implement whatever changes are necessary to deal with the most critical of them.

With the support of other senior administrators, Professor Beyah will coordinate the work of the Office of Information Technology (OIT) and other administrative and academic units and will engage internal and external consultants as needed. He will report directly to me. Jim McGarrah will remain in his role as interim CIO and will manage the day-to-day operations for OIT.

The exposure of student data by a staff member earlier this week makes it clear that our systems, policies, and practices are inadequate. While existing efforts to strengthen data governance must remain a top priority, we need additional, immediate actions to lower the risk of additional failures of the sort we experienced this week.

To be clear, the risks we face around the access and use of data are not just technical. They are also organizational and cultural and therefore require everyone’s attention. It would be a mistake to assume this is a problem for only OIT to fix. I expect all administrative and academic units to collaborate in this effort, and to begin by immediately redoubling precautions in existing protocols and data access privileges.

Professor Beyah will continue to serve in his current role in Interdisciplinary Research and to hold the Motorola Foundation Professorship in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

The work with a cross-functional team will begin immediately. In addition, Didier Contis, director of Technology Services for the College of Engineering, will assist Professor Beyah in leading the team. Institute Communications will be providing updates about this work through stories in the Daily Digest and in-person forums.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter and for your collaboration.

posts,"College Republicans President just resigned over the impeachment inquiry. Got this email, basically says the national GOP sucks now and should buck Trump

Hello friends.

A week ago, the House of Representatives voted to formalize the process of impeaching the President. I was disappointed to see that not a single Republican voted in favor. While the Democrats’ approach to this process has been far from perfect, it has become abundantly clear that our President has unlawfully abused the trust placed in him via the office that he holds. His actions with respect to the ongoing scandal regarding his communications with the President of Ukraine are without explanation or excuse. An ever-increasing body of evidence indicates that our President has broken the law, and if someone claims to uphold the constitution, then the appropriate response is clear: these actions must be investigated, and the President must be held responsible.

I have always considered myself a Republican. My views on policy and governing principles have not changed during the course of this administration, even while the national party has contorted itself and abandoned some of its longest-standing principles to placate its current leader in the White House. In fact, these principles – respect for our constitution, rule of law, and the belief that the President should be held to the highest ethical standards – are what led me to conclude that I must separate myself from the GOP and support the ongoing impeachment inquiry. It brings me no joy to break with a party that, for years, I have seen as holding the best solutions to so many political questions. It is clear, however, that the present-day national Republican Party, with few exceptions, cares more about defending the indefensible in an attempt to cling to their own power than pursuing truth and justice. This party has lost sight of the values that made it unique and has fallen into the trap of chasing the whims of one man who constantly lies, brings shame to our country, and defies our constitution. This is the same man who, when speaking of John McCain, said he prefers those who ""weren't captured"" despite his several deferments from duty. While Senator McCain sat in a Vietcong prison cell, the President described avoiding contracting STDs as ""his own personal Vietnam."" The President’s term will come to an end – his leadership is temporary. However, the stains he has placed on the party he represents and the conservative movement will be recorded forever in history. I sincerely hope that the mantle of Republican leadership one day returns to those who value honor, dignity, and conservative principles, but those currently at the helm of the Party seem to be charting a course towards a much darker future for the GOP.

Many people who share my views have stayed silent, hoping that soon enough the embarrassment of the current administration will blow over and we can pretend this presidency never happened. That is simply not possible – it is increasingly clear that continued silence is tantamount to complicity. Those of us who cannot abide by this President’s actions must make clear where we stand. The reluctance of the party to separate itself from its leader, or even to criticize him on his worst mistakes, shows that change from the inside is not currently possible. As such, I will be stepping down as Chairman of the College Republicans at Georgia Tech, effective immediately. If there is no tolerance for dissent and no appetite for following the law in the national GOP, I must respectfully part ways. I believe there is much good to be recovered from this political organization, but that is all it is – a political organization. It does not, and should not, dominate our lives. I, for one cannot support the actions of the current leaders of the party, and so I will be, for the time being, separating myself from their leadership.

The last two years we shared as a chapter were extraordinary in so many ways - no doubt in large part because of the many incredible people I’ve had the privilege of meeting through this organization. We more than doubled our membership and hosted many great leaders whom I still respect, including then-Secretary Brian Kemp. It is regrettable that my service must end in this way, but I simply could not allow the current leadership of the national party to speak for me anymore. I hope that in my time leading our chapter I have represented our shared principles and Georgia Tech well.

All the best and Go Jackets,

posts,"Anyone who lives in Modera Midtown or any apartment near campus?. I am an OOS transfer and looking for a rental right now. Because my current school ends around on Dec 20th-ish, and given that the first day of the class at GaTech is on Jan 6th (and FASET orientation is on Jan 3rd), I really have little time for a house hunting. It is nearly impossible for me to look at houses in person because it is 10+ hr driving from here. Also, I need to move everything with my two dogs (They are rescues who get scared easily, so I will live alone), so I need an address to move stuff before I hire a mover. So, I practically have to sign a lease online without being able to see the place in person where I will have to stay for more than a year... which is quite scary. 

So, I've been browsing Zillow and Trulia for rentals, and I narrrowed down to a few apartments, and then I checked reviews of each one of them on Yelp and I had to cross out everything because the reviews were so bad and it seemed like they were no place for living. But after crossing out those apts, I can't really find any other options :( 

So, I am trying to reconsider my lists... and if anyone is living near campus, or have lived one of these aprtments on my list, or any recommendation would be appreciated.

My budget is less than 2k/month, and what I am looking for is safe, quiet, smoke-free enivronment.

So my list included (No offense to anyone who lives here. I only know about these places from what I read online. they all have bad reviews on Yelp but I commented for those which have extremely bad reviews)
 
1. Baltimore at midtown(Yelp reviews were too horrible so I am not considering here at all)
2.  Modera midtown
3. Skyhouse midtown
4. Hanover west peachtree
5. Broadstone midtown (Horrible Yelp review as well..)
6. The mark at west midtown
7. The local on 14th
8. Radius west midtown",negative,-0.9671,negative,-0.11116056882185914,11/09/2019

posts,"Locked classroom policy?. Just wondering the rationale of why classrooms and meeting rooms are always locked when not in use, or at least on the weekends and hours outside of normal class times. I'm questioning this because on numerous occasions, I would have liked a nice study space, with normal chairs and tables at a usable height. However, there are not many great places to plop down and do a lot of work by yourself. A lot of would-be perfect places to study at Tech are ""collaborative spaces"" or locked without reservation. 

Living on West, I feel that half the space in willage is inconvenient for studying, whether it's because it's loud, there aren't good tables with the chairs, or because it's just designed to be a common space rather than having dedicated silent study space. The next closest options are Kendeda (which is BEAUTIFUL) or the student center. But once you go inside Kendeda you quickly realize study space is almost non-existent. There's a ton of potential space to be used, but the huge classrooms are locked when not in use, and the tiny student space is filled with fancy chairs and stools. The student center faces the same problems as willage, yet arguably worse.

I fear that, as Georgia Tech constructs new buildings and renovates old ones, they're putting too much of a focus on 'collaborative' spaces and making things appear modern and attractive. I'm hopeful for the new library renewal to provide a large amount of student space. (look at this!  [https://www.bnim.com/project/price-gilbert-and-crosland-tower-library-renewal](https://www.bnim.com/project/price-gilbert-and-crosland-tower-library-renewal) ). Honestly, I want something that resembles even one floor of Crosland, on West, that I can just grind out math at 11:58 p.m. without having to walk 15 minutes.

 I am slow and methodical with my math, else I oft make mistakes confusing numbers. (For whatever reason, I will confuse 1-7, 3-9-8 a lot and will swap numbers 54 = 45). For example, I had a Simulation test that was long I did not finish. The average was a 70, but I scored a 50 on it! I also notice whenever tests are curved I do worse than when they are not compared to the average.

President Cabrera has appointed Professor Raheem Beyah, Vice President of Interdisciplinary Research and expert in cybersecurity, to lead an effort to investigate existing vulnerabilities in data access across the Institute and implement whatever changes are necessary to deal with the most critical of them. Dr. Beyah will coordinate the work of the Office of Information Technology (OIT) and other administrative and academic units and will engage internal and external consultants as needed. He will report directly to the president.

Greetings: 

In response to the recent data disclosure, access  to T-Square will become restricted to campus networks or campus VPN  beginning Friday, November 15 between 10 a.m. and 12 p.m. 

For additional information about how to gain VPN access visit [ b.gatech.edu/vpninfo](https://oit.gatech.edu/security-incident-remediation).

He may write the entire paper, but the implementation of the research and the majority of the published results come from the team effort. He did not even notify us that he planned to publish it. It seemed like he consolidated the research work and did all the writing with the other author behind our back without notifying us. I am wondering what should I do with this situation?

We are all graduate students enrolled in a master's program. Both he and I have shared interested in applying for the same Ph.D. program this year. He has a few publications before coming to this graduate program. I am totally new to the academic publication and just started collaborating with a professor this summer on a project which could lead to publication.

posts,"In Defense of Georgia Tech’s Productive Data Mismanagement and Strategic Career-Oriented Leaks.   

This defense is specifically a queen-side castle, tailored to show the brilliant benefits that come not from just one, but several consecutive FERPA violations. As a member of the final generation before god knows what (Gen Z as it were), I have more data than I know what to do with. I hide it under my mattress and in my selfie jars, but I often wish there was some easier way to dispose of it—burning cranks the global thermostat too much for my avacadoless-toast tastes. 

As a solution, Georgia Tech’s management (GTM) has taken the burden upon themselves to R&amp;D a multi-iterative solution. Reliable inside sources \[*Insert source here when found*\] have confirmed that all of Georgia Tech’s data leaks have been with strict purpose—to consider otherwise that GTM has shown repeated negligence and a near-zero graduate-hire rate from their own world-competitive computer science and cybersecurity programs is troubling, and trouble is something nobody should have to deal with, so don’t think about that another second.

The solution was to release “sensitive” student data over the course of several years so that employers could be notified as potential hires matured. In this sense, GTM has committed to a strange program that provides free exposure to students, precipitating connections that would have otherwise never come to be. As a personal anecdote, I have been contacted by dozens of legitimate companies about opportunities as a package manager, one of the most prestigious careers a person of my degree can have, where I would not only manually pack, but ship packages! 

However, don’t let my opinion sway you on the fact. An interview with notable GT grad B. Tray, EdD. shows how the generous act has affected the student populace:

*:Transcript pasted below:*

TRAY: You know, I was a bit worried the first time I got that e-mail letting me know my information was basically sold for free, but I came around to it after the third or fourth time. Honestly, I’ve heard that the program that Georgia Tech is doing isn’t even halfway over. I can’t wait to see the rush of new offers when the next leak happens in Q2 or Q3, 2020. It’s like waiting eagerly for a game you saw was announced at E3; I really hope they stick to the schedule with this one—the previous leak was a month or two late.

Georgia Tech has also sent e-mails to the populace to assure that the leaks were intentional and, as a matter of fact, beneficial. E-mails were sent to the whole list of affected students, and replies to individual concerns have been replied to privately as well. These replies masked the true student’s identity, which you can find on the web, and instead GTM preferred to address everyone on the list as a “Will”, last name available through a microtransaction on Buzzport. This mass-reply e-mail meant for a single person has been a show of good Will by GTM.

With these facts presented, I hope your fears have been assuaged, reader, and that you have found a new light to look on this fortunate, purposeful breach of privacy in your interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers,

Maxwell Hellman

What is this?

""Missed Connections"" is somewhere people can send in stories when they saw someone in short passing around Tech but did not get the chance to meet/talk with them. This account allows people to send in these stories and hopefully be introduced to their special someone!

Will my identity remain anonymous?

Yes! The idea is the person who believes they are being mentioned in the post will either: comment below, and the sender can then confirm/contact them OR the person who believes the post is about them can contact [@GTMissedConnections](https://www.instagram.com/gtmissedconnections/) directly and I can forward the info to the sender.

Why Instagram?

Instagram allows for quick and easy sharing while still curating material.  Additionally, Instagram is believed to be the  most popular, although not best (reddit) sharing site. Plus, photos and profile pictures are very prominent, making the experience even better.

Please share this with your friends and offer feedback on how to make this as enjoyable as possible. I personally believe this can bring a little bit of joy to everyone's life at GT!
