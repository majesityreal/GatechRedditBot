My days are packed with classes, doing homework, and studying, but it‚Äôs still only enough to just do alright in the difficult classes.

1. Spring 2020 College of Computing career , January 17th.
2. Spring 2020 All majors career fair, Feb 5-6.

Which one do you think we should attend. We could probably do both. But do you guys know which one is more suitable for Machine Learning (mine) Computing Systems (girlfriend's) concentrations? The typical positions we're looking for are:

posts,"Find the new Under the Couch and I'll give you money. PAYMENT FOR ALL GOOD INFO

Hello! It's me, your friendly university Musician's Network president (until spring semester at least)!

Under the Couch is a student run arts space and music venue. It is the home of Musician's Network and its shows, and MN helps put on shows and events for many other organizations and departments within the space. During the daytime it serves as a relaxing public lounge with music and ~atmosphere~. There are also practice spaces and a studio. 

I don't know how many of you remember or were previously informed, but Under the Couch will be going down with the upcoming Student Center demolition in May 2020, and there are no plans for a new one to be built when the new Campus Center is constructed. Only the Musician's Network practice spaces and studio will remain. 

This, however, does not have to be the end of student-run arts space on campus.

After a meeting with VP of Campus Services Kasey Helton,  Senior Director of the Student Center Lindsay Bryant, and Undergraduate Student Body President Pooja Juvekar, Musician's Network is now looking for alternative locations around campus to serve as a location for a new Under the Couch.

There are a few wants/needs that would make a location suitable:

* Ability to accommodate 50+ persons at capacity
* Ability to install a sound system (big speakers/equipment and sound booth)
* Ability to be loud and play amplified music
* Space to install a stage and lighting
* Space to store equipment
* Easy access for patrons and load-in
* Bathroom Access
* Space to function as a daytime lounge
* Visibility 

Not all of these necessarily need to be met, but the more the better


We have a few ideas so far. Some are just shots in the dark/completely off the wall, and that's fine. We're brainstorming now and we'll look into further feasibility in the future.

* Living Learning Communities room near the wing zone
* Woody's Food Court
* Second Floor of Barnes and Noble
* Wreck Techs space on East Campus
* Brittain Rec
* Rent a storefront in Tech Square 
* Somewhere in the library?? (lol noise) 
* Somewhere near the football stadium?? 
* Somewhere around the biotech quad?? (I only know of the restaurant area) 
* Somewhere at the Bill Moore Student Success Center??
* Biltmore Building Basement?? 
* Dalney Parking Deck somehow
* NAV West, North (/u/illusions18) 
* Wacky off campus ideas: church west of CRC,  church north of 10th, Annex bookstore
* Other things we talked about in the meeting but I forgot to mention (sorry): CODA, Kandeda building, freshman connector, west village, Scheller Tower, SAA house
* Paper Building?? 
*Aware Home (/u/ILoveSilverForks) 

(If you or your organization currently occupy any of these spaces, I do not mean to step on any toes with these suggestions) 
So not all of these are overseen by Campus Services. The easiest solution would likely be under them but starting a conversation with a different department could also be possible.


ANYHOW

If you have any good ideas about underused spaces on campus that could suit our needs, I want to hear them!! I'll venmo $5 for every good, unique suggestion (this is my offer personally, not the club or any other gt organization). $2.50 for further info of possible spaces on the ""??"" ones. Thank you for your help!

&gt; There has been a concern raised about the fact that the final assignment (Lab 10) is due during the final exam period.  I just wanted to reassure everyone that this is clearly within the rules because it is given in lieu of a final exam.

This assignment is considered as a replacement for the final exam.

&gt; Best of luck on Lab 10 and hope you enjoyed the course.

Judging by rule [12.D.1](http://catalog.gatech.edu/rules/12/), wouldn't this have to be on our syllabus to be valid?

If you're not familiar with the chant, when you're in the crowd and the opposing player completely misses the rim/backboard with a shot, that's an airball, and you're supposed to remind him of it every single time he has the ball defensively, by chanting ""Airball"" at him. 

We did this to Syracuse about two years ago and it completely shut down one of their starters - John Gillon went 2-10 from the field and 1-7 from three and finished the game with just 7 points. [Some Syracuse fan got so fed up with the Airball chants that he called Josh Pastner to complain.](https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/cuse-fan-complains-about-air-ball-chant-georgia-tech-coach-phones-him-back/) Pastner's response was to have [Airball t-shirts](https://twitter.com/GTAthletics/status/958469608826179584?s=19) in advance of their next home game against the Orange.

I currently attend a university and want to transfer over to GT. However, since I do not meet the requirements, I am thinking about transferring to GSU Perimeter - Dunwoody and doing REP there for the 2020 fall semester.

1. I was wondering if anyone has ever taken any online classes for REP.

2. I also noticed that CS isn't considered an engineering major in REP. If it is not in REP, would I be better off just taking the CS courses at GSU Perimeter and try to transfer over to GT?

posts,"Why I changed to Public Policy. Hoo boy this is way longer than I thought it was going to be. Buckle up, kiddos.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, I came in as an AE student. I had somehow gotten it into my head that I was going to be an engineer, no ifs, ands, or buts. I wasn't even pushed particularly hard in this direction; it wasn't like my family pressured me into it. But somehow when I was about 16, it simply became obvious that I was going to be an engineer. Now, I have always been good at math and science classes. But I never really enjoyed them.

Of course, I realized that engineering as a major was basically going to be non-stop math for my whole career. I realize now that that should have been a flashing warning light that this wasn't for me, but I ignored it, because I had my plan and was too committed to change it. When I was applying here, I had a bit of a hard time because most of my extracurriculars were not engineering based: Debate Club, etc. That should have been warning sign #2, but I kept going because I was on my set path and felt it wasn't responsible of me to change now.

And so I got accepted, and got started. But my classes weren't interesting. At all. In the slightest. The only classes I had that were even mildly engaging to me were a pair of philosophy and ethics classes I took because I needed to pad out my schedule. My engineering and sciences classes were dreadful. But I figured that if I ""put in my time"" at the lower level classes, maybe things would get better. I finished out year one with a strong GPA, and hoped that things would improve from there.

My first summer after first year, I had an internship. I thought I was lucky to get it, and I guess I was. But the experience was absolutely atrocious. I was an engineering intern at an aerospace company working on certification engineering, but it was probably the worst experience of my life. Soul-crushing is an understatement. I worked in a cubicle for nine hours a day. The absolute limit of the ""intern experience"" officially provided by the company was two catered lunched with video calls with interns from other locations, and a ticket to baseball game. To be fair, it wasn't all the company's fault. The leader of the team that I was assigned to transferred within two weeks of my arrival, leading the whole department a bit rudderless. But still, it was a terrifying look at a possible future. I spent ten weeks there ever the summer. for seven of them, I worked on a single excel spreadsheet. One file. For data analysis. It wasn't collaborative or anything; I would put in the required equations, report back, and get a new set of parameters to input. More than once I nearly fell asleep at my desk out of sheer boredom and monotony. I started punching my calculator to see exactly how many seconds I had before I could leave for the day. What's worse, my last day when I presented what I had worked on, the team seemed unimpressed, with one person going so far as asking what the point of the whole exercise was.

So, I returned to school this semester with a sour taste in my mouth. But, it was my second year, I was moving up in classes, it would be better, right? Wrong. My classes this semester have been more tedious than ever. The only one that I enjoyed even a little bit was a philosophy class, again a schedule-padder. All the others were just horrible. I hated the classes. I hated the material. I hated the homework. It became a chore to even show up. My grades this semester have certainly suffered from my apathy towards the classes I'm taking; I know already that I'm going to get a D or worse in one class, and my prospects for the other's aren't great either. The most frightening thing for me was, though, that I didn't care. These classes meant nothing to me. I didn't care how well I did in them anymore. I had checked out mentally.

Around this point is when I began seriously questioning my place here. It wasn't that I didn't want to do aerospace anymore; I was done with engineering as a discipline entirely. I hated the classes, and hated the job. Of course, it took a long time for me to actually get serious about a change of course. I had basically resigned myself to a career that I couldn't stand, and would never really be passionate about. I choose aerospace out of the engineering disciplines simply because I thought rockets were cool and that maybe if I was working on something interesting I could eek out some sort of satisfaction. But that wasn't happening.

At this point, I'd like to give a shout-out to a certain professor, Hans Klein. He taught the philosophy class this semester I took, which focused on illusions in society. One quote of his has stuck with me for months: ""Everyone thinks they want a job at Google. But do you really want a job at Google, or is that what you've been told to want?"" Of course, for me Google wasn't the target, but that really hit the nail on the head for me: I didn't want to be an aerospace engineer and work at SpaceX or NASA of Boeing. That's what I had convinced myself that I wanted in order to keep myself on this track. And it was time to get off. Seriously, if you need a few extra hours next semester, take on of his classes. I can't recommend them enough.

So, now I knew I didn't want to be an engineering major. So what did I want to be? Well, actually, that came pretty obviously to me. I love politics and government. I volunteered during the 2016 election, and actually met a Senator at a polling place on election day. I went to a political rally for my preferred candidate (which I will not name because dear lord no need to open that can of worms.) My favorite classes in high school were Civics and Economics, and later AP Government and Politics. About a month ago, I stayed up late watching the Canadian election results. I'm not even Canadian! I read news and opinion articles daily, hell it's one of the preloaded tabs on my phone. I went to Boy's State, which is a sort of camp for high schoolers put on my the American Legion that's basically a huge mock government of a fictional state that runs for a week. The signs were all there, and looking back it's frustrating that I deliberately ignored all the signs to run down the engineering track. I've started to think that maybe, just maybe, engineering is our generation's version of doctor or lawyer: the ""it"" degree that everyone looks up to as the pinnacle of success.

So public policy it was. Though I haven't made the official switch yet, I'm now pursuing a Public Policy degree, with a minor in International Affairs. I've begun exploring transferring schools, but I haven't made any decisions yet. If I do stay here, I'll have to take an extra year, but I'd much rather do it in a degree that I look forward to than one I hate. I'll officially change my major if I do decide to stay after next semester.

It's kind of strange, where I am right now. All of my finals are this week, but exactly none of them actually count towards Public Policy. Of course I want to do well on them to keep up my GPA, but it'll be taking a hit anyway. It was pretty good beforehand, so it won't hurt all that much. As such, the pressure is way, way lower. I'll do my best, but it's not the end of the world if I don't do great. A bit of a side story- my last regular physics exam was a few weeks ago, at 6 PM. This didn't help me at all when I realized that at 1 AM that night. Completely forgot the exam. Coincidentally, earlier that day I had made up my mind to change majors. My dad swears it was self-sabotage, my subconscious mind telling me exactly what direction I should be going in. I'm not sure if I believe it, but food for thought.

So next semester, I'll be coming back with a suite of public policy and international relations classes. I might leave my calculator at home. If I had to go back after Christmas break to another semester like this, I would have had a hard time making the trip to the airport. But now, I can honestly say that I think next semester will be better. Moral of the story: make sure you're doing what you want to do. If something feels wrong, that's because it is. Don't let yourself be convinced that you're following your dreams until you really examine what you want to do with your life. Thanks for reading.",negative,-0.9976,12/09/2019

posts,"My professor was genuinely awful this semester an I want to report them, but I don‚Äôt know how. This semester I went abroad and took a six week course that was really a shit show. The prof assigned ungodly amounts of reading and had incredibly dense 2 hour lectures that would cover up to 2 chapters/lecture. Homework assignments over material that was not in the book or lectures would be assigned on an irregular schedule right before exams. Clicker questions were not graded for participation, and our professor would close questions even if you asked him to give you more time for a response (very small lecture so it‚Äôs not like he didn‚Äôt hear us). Each test was worth 24 or 28 percent of the course and given via word document despite our class asking for hard copies because we were required to show calculations and draw figures. The icing on top was that the exams were just verbatim or modified questions from a test bank pool of over 200 questions. This sounds like something desirable, but the combination of the material being so poorly taught, the tests being given in such a shitty and stressful way, the lack of TAs, and the fact that studying wasn‚Äôt even concept driven is infuriating. I can‚Äôt save my gpa from this course but I don‚Äôt want anyone else to go through this. I haven‚Äôt learned anything because all I did was try to memorize answers to questions (honestly there was no point in trying to keep up with the material after a while, it was so overwhelming).

I‚Äôve done the cios but I want this professor off this abroad program. I don‚Äôt care if they have to cut the class from the program entirely, I just want someone to be accountable for this absolute rigor pipe dream.

posts,"Question to current students - mental health. Tech has had a reputation for high attrition and unhappy students since long before I started there in the mid 90's.  A large portion of the issues when I was there fell under tough curriculum,  partially indifferent faculty (this varied greatly from department to department and staff person to staff person), relative lack of avenues as an outlet and workload.

I started under the quarter system, which more or less forced students to get their ish together within the first week of class because the first test was typically during the 2nd or 3rd week.

I read a lot on here and in random zuckerberg nyetwork posts about the mental health issues.   There wasn't a true central forum where the issues could be discussed back then (the git.\* newsgroups weren't frequented by all that many students and online social media consisted of ICQ/AIM chats).

&amp;#x200B;

Is the situation worse now, or does it just have a more noticeable presence?  Campus has come a long way since then, and even though Atlanta isn't the ""it"" city it was in the early to mid 90's, there are way more amenities, activities and access to a larger portion of it than the end of the last century (E3 and on the bricks concerts notwithstanding).

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like the food situation has taken a turn for the worse, but there were maybe 5 spots total to get food back then.  Brittain, Woodruff, Student center (food court and that restaurant on the 3rd floor) and the Athletic Association if you were an athlete (or post the NCAA ruling that they had to allow general access at least some of the time).  Everything else was a hodge podge of clubs, professional society chapter meetings or Tech sponsored events.  Atlantic station was largely a wasteland.  You guys seem to have at least some access to food trucks, door dash, uber eats, etc.   One of my roommates who stayed on campus during thanksgiving ate my tostitos for thanksgiving dinner because he had no access to a car.  I feel like he'd have had more options available nowadays.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, so what gives?   Things always look better in hindsight, but I remember the ever present stress, the guilt of not spending every waking moment studying, doing homework, or engaging in other academic pursuits to bolster my grades  or knowledge.  I also remember wishing I could just graduate and be done with tests forever every single dead week.  It definitely broke some of us mentally.  I can think of one or two dorm mates that just left campus mid-term after struggling... and hearing from others who made plans to do so after the quarter/semester was over due to personal or academic issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Besides asking whether the climate has worsened, I am also asking how many of you believe that students should be able to lean hard on the administration for mental well being and therapy services.     My classmates at the time would have scoffed a bit at the idea.... thinking it akin to asking your abuser to offer therapy for the abuse that they themselves were administering.   No, petting a dog for a few minutes isn't going to give respite from lab reports, coding assignments or a series of major tests....  but I'm not sure what else the administration could really offer?   The odds that they are going to lighten the academic load, ask professors to be more circumspect about the quality of instruction and make campus an easier place to thrive with less energy &amp; effort from the undergrads across the board seems preeeetty far fetched.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like a semester away or a co-op/internship would be a more effective fix than anything Tech could practially offer.

posts,"Tax time coming up: Important things to remember. As an American citizen, I love paying taxes, but as a person who requires money, I love tax refunds even more. Here's some quick reminders for college students:

1. If you receive a W-2, you SHOULD fill out a tax form. Generally go to Turbotax or H&amp;R Block online unless you have a very special situation
2. If you worked in multiple states, you must pay taxes based on where you worked. In RARE occasions, you may also have to pay taxes based on where you lived.
3. You may only claim yourself as a dependent if no one else can. Figure this out with your parents.
4. If you are an immigrant and by some miracle (praise God) got a job in the US, you must pay US taxes.
5. Room and Board are generally not eligible for deductions and credits like Tuition and Fees.
6. The American Opportunity Tax Credit is a Godsend. Claim it if you can, and make sure you are eligible. It goes up to 2500 dollars in tax credits.
7. You can only receive the American Opportunity Tax Credit for four years of post-high school. It is a credit not a deduction meaning that it reduces tax burden, not taxable income.
8. As a Graduate student, you may be eligible for the Lifetime Opportunity Tax Credit. If you started Grad school in the fall of your fourth year, you may still be eligible for the American Opportunity Tax Credit. The American Opportunity Tax Credit can provide a refund of up to 1000 in some circumstances and is usually the better bet if you can take it if you don't earn much income.
9. Keep your T1098. Forward to your parents if necessary.
10. Keep track of unreimbursed Medical expenses and be sure to deduct them if they are eligible.
11. Fellowships are income if they surpass eligible expenses. Make sure to keep tabs on Fellowships earned and have enough to potentially pay taxes on them.
12. You may be required to fill out a paper form for special tax purposes (Like working in multiple states.)
13. The American Opportunity Tax credit cannot be used for expenses not required by the institute, but the Lifetime Opportunity Tax Credit can. Keep track of books you buy even if not for school.
14. Georgia Tech REQUIRES a computer as a condition of enrollment according to the student handbook. This means that a computer does qualify as an expense for the purposes of the American Opportunity Tax Credit as the university require it.
15. If you worked as a waitress, waiter, or contractor, your tips or payments ARE income and you may have to pay taxes based on what you earned. You likely won't get a refund in this situation and may end up owing.
16. If you have any investments or a interest bearing money market or sweep accounts, you may be required to pay taxes on capital gains or dividends regardless of whether you took money out. In the future, consider a Roth IRA.
17. Cryptocurrency gains are taxable. Consult Turbotax for more on this one and as always HODL.
18. It's better to hire an accountant than to go to jail. Be especially cognizant if you started a small business this year.
19. Being married changes the tax rules, keep this in mind if you got married (Congrats!)
20. If your employer is paying for part of your tuition, this will decrease eligibility for credits.
21. If you are an older student with a low income and fit certain rules, you may be eligible for the earned income tax credit. Ask Turbotax.
22. I think that's it. Correct me or ask questions if you have them.
23. THwG and congrats on finals. Thanks for reading.

posts,"The 2004 Humanitarian Bowl (Georgia Tech vs. Tulsa): The largest weight disparity between school mascots. At first glance, the [2004 Humanitarian Bowl](https://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=240030202), a relatively obscure bowl game in Boise, was a fairly uninteresting, lopsided game between two wholly average programs. The Yellow Jackets took an early lead in the first quarter and enjoyed a 10-3 lead at halftime; the second half was a perfect storm of explosive offense and unforgiving defense in which Tech scored 42 points while only allowing the Golden Hurricane a single touchdown. Tech stymied Tulsa's run game, holding them to -56 (*yes, that's a negative*) yards--Tulsa's worst-ever rushing performance in the 125-year history of their football program. 

This matchup was the most recent of the [three](http://www.winsipedia.com/tulsa/vs/georgia-tech) between the two storied institutions (the previous two occurred in 1944 and 1945, with a Tech and Tulsa win, respectively). These programs have only met at bowl games and have no particular bad blood between one another off the field; however, these three games were the only occasion in which the **heaviest mascot in FBS football (the Golden Hurricane) competed against the lightest (the Yellow Jacket**).

An [SBNation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obtRtrk42a8) places the weight of a single yellow jacket at 0.0001 lbs and (perhaps very unscientifically) estimates the weight of an entire hurricane made of gold to be 1,182,000,000,000 lbs. This mascot weight differential of 1,181,999,999,999.9999 pounds is the largest that has and will ever occur in an FBS football game until a university with a lighter or heavier mascot joins the division or until an existing school adopts a new, unconventional mascot. 

I don't know when Georgia Tech will play Tulsa again. Perhaps there will be another 65-year hiatus. But I hope not. Personally, I would love to cheer on our tiny mascot against its behemoth counterparts and will be watching intently next time Tech's and Tulsa's paths cross.",positive,0.8384,12/14/2019

posts,"GT undergraduate applicant query. Dear Yellow Jackets,

Congrats on the finish of the finals. Merry Christmas and happy break.

Need advice for two of my ""potential freshman"" friends

Background

Both of them have visited GT and love the ambiance and students body. Both of them have excellent standardized testing  scores, will be their class's valedictorian or salutatorian, have decent ECs and both of them are OOS (full fees).

Candidate A

Wants to definitely become a Doctor so Med school it is. He is super keen to come to GT but parents and friends are warning about grade deflation and high pressure at GT. The general advice given to him is to land up at one of the smaller Ivys, relatively chill, collect the 4.0/4.0 and move on to Med school. So the question is whether Med schools/Grad schools recognize that GT is much more harder than your typical Ivy in terms of grade deflation and rigor of curriculum. Other things being equal(hard work motivation etc.), Will a say 3.6 at GT be ranked superior than say a 3.9 from Brown. 

Please, the aim is not to disparage GT or Ivys but realistically figure out the trade offs. ( [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/20/why-grade-inflation-even-at-harvard-is-a-big-problem/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/12/20/why-grade-inflation-even-at-harvard-is-a-big-problem/)  or   [https://www.studentsreview.com/viewprofile.php3?k=1230783522&amp;u=331](https://www.studentsreview.com/viewprofile.php3?k=1230783522&amp;u=331) ).  

&amp;#x200B;

Candidate B 

Is super keen to  join GT. She is from Florida, has a number of relatives and friends in Georgia. She has allergy issues in minus zero weather (realizes that she will be miserable in cold weather Ivys) and loves hot and humid Hotlanta. Candidate has \~&gt; 75% percentile credentials.  Off-late GT has started deferring over qualified candidates in order to yield protect. Early application is already done. Candidate B wants your advice on what to do from now till Jan 18 (results date) to tell the admissions team that she is super keen and will definitely join if given a chance (please please), please don't deffer or reject thinking that the candidate will go off to Ivys instead of coming to GT.

Thank you",positive,0.9987,12/15/2019

posts,"An open letter to the Georgia Tech Marching Band. Dear friends:  

As you know, this was my last season with the Yellow Jacket Marching Band.  But as I leave, here are some final remarks for the rest of y'all.

This season definitely was not the most ideal on many fronts.  Losing the right to play chords for a good portion of the home schedule.  Losing to an FCS school.  More frustrating losses.  And of course, the band's ongoing struggle with marketing.  But despite that, y'all still did a great job this season!  Y'all brought the energy every game from kickoff to the last whistle regardless of the score.  You supported the team through thick and thin with passion, honor, grace, and valor.  And you performed a kick-ass halftime show that paid tribute to the music of this great city!  And through it all, I was proud to serve alongside you one last time!

Which is why I implore you: never let that spirit die!  This season's team was young and scrappy, but raw and unrefined.  And despite the talent on the roster there was a lot of unrefined, raw, and at times undisciplined football.  But there was also a team that kept fighting and never gave in regardless of the score.  To me, what I saw was a team that had bought into Geoff Collins's effort-based culture: the first step in a deep rebuild.  And it is my belief that eventually that effort and grit and tenacity is going to translate into winning seasons.  Perhaps sooner than anyone anticipates.

That aside, there is one critical reason you cannot let that spirit die.  Together, the Georgia Tech Band, Goldrush, Color Guard, and Cheer, represent the loudest, proudest, and most passionate group in the entire Georgia Tech fanbase.  You are at the front lines of cheering for this team and you have to shoulder that responsibility every game.  Whether that's on the field, in the stands, or outside the stadium before games, you have one responsibility on game days: to lead and to set the example.
May that be your cry.  And may you all do it together as a family week in and week out.
Empower those men on the football team to do what they came here to do.  And that wasn't to play around.  It was to take care of business.  And fight.  And win!

WE GONNA FIGHT
TILL WE CAN'T FIGHT NO MORE!!
GONNA LIE DOWN AND BLEED AWHILE,
THEN WE GONNA GET UP AND FIGHT SOME MORE!!!

Turn the Yellow Jackets loose next season!!!

GTRI is conveniently located on campus (minus the Cobb County Research Facility in Smyrna) and hires many Tech students every year. The URIP is a 10 week summer internship, where students work 40 hours a week and get paid upwards of $20 an hour to work on a project outlined by a GTRI Researcher.  

You can apply to as many projects as you want at [https://urip.gtri.gatech.edu](https://urip.gtri.gatech.edu) by the deadline of January 17th, and update your project preferences by January 28th, then offer letters go out February 3rd-7th for students that have been chosen. You can see all of the projects as well as some FAQs and the timeline at the link above. I was also an intern this past summer, and I still work there part-time now, so I‚Äôm able to answer any questions you may have about GTRI or the URIP specifically.

I have called multiple numbers and left multiple voicemails, and have emailed and got an unhelpful auto reply.

I only saw the immunizations come up on my housing contract and realized I needed to do this to be in Atlanta. 

My immunizations are incomplete only for the varicella and meningococcal vaccines. The first I have History (not accepted) and the second was apparently waived when I went to my undergrad school. I don't know why I never got this one. 

My questions are (based on what I can accomplish without having to spend $300 to get these vaccines):

1. GT accepts a titer for varicella, but it might be as late as January 10th when I get the results . Does anyone know if they let someone start on campus conditionally until their record is complete?

2. On the form it says that the meningococcal vaccines is required for all students under 22. It doesn't say ""only"" though, making me wonder if it is okay to not have this vaccine, as I am over 22.

I'm a freshman in another university (not going to say unless it's important which it may very well be) and I've been thinking about transferring into Georgia Tech.

I saw on the website that applications open January 15th, and that historically the acceptance rate isn't that high for transfer students. 

People in gatech that have transferred into this school, is there anything special I should know? What is the application like? Are there any important people I can talk to? Or is it just another high school to college application? 

I'm also interested in how good of a chance I have at transferring but I don't feel like spewing my stats here as of yet. If there's any kind soul in this subreddit that has enough spare time to PM me about the process I'd greatly appreciate it.

posts,"Business Administration at GA Tech. I'm a prospective student looking at Georgia Tech for its Business Administration major, and from what I've heard, it's much easier to get into for that major. 

I'm an out-of-state applicant whose GPA is lower than I'd like, so I was wondering if I have a decent chance to get in. 

Additionally, on the Georgia Tech website it says that they ""use the weighted GPA if available"", and while my unweighted GPA isn't high, my weighted GPA is. How does GA Tech consider weighted vs. unweighted GPA for undergraduate admissions?",positive,0.6249,12/29/2019
posts,"Is it worth it to pursue a minor or double-major?. Hello! I'm currently a third-year CS major and have lately been thinking about pursuing a minor or double major. I was thinking about doing another hard science like Chemistry or BME(leaning more on BME). The thing is that I have almost no clue on the difficulty of these programs but more importantly, don't even know if it would be worth pursuing. I've had a few internships that were all in enterprise or business software and have been feeling sick of it so I thought that minoring or double majoring in one of these would allow me to specialize in software tailored to biotech or maybe even try and do something completely different like premed or research. I think I've just been in a very doubtful phase in regards to my future.

I'm also worried about my graduation time. As of now, I am due to already graduate a semester late and since I haven't even started the BME track, I'd have to start with GenChem and GenBio. This means that my graduation time would be pushed back a full year or even more. At this point, is it even worth it for me to try this? How difficult would it be and would it be? Would the end result be worth it on my diploma?

posts,"Stay safe and don't join celebratory gunfire please. First of all, happy holidays yellow jackets!

Please stay safe and don't join any celebratory gunfire. I know this sounds silly but look at this if you plan to join the gunfire party:  [https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/year-old-boy-shot-during-new-year-celebration-with-family-police-say/bR3Jmnlv4P7l8tRK6AKY7M/](https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/year-old-boy-shot-during-new-year-celebration-with-family-police-say/bR3Jmnlv4P7l8tRK6AKY7M/) 

If anyone that you know plans to have celebratory gunfire this year, please try to stop them. This is nothing but something that makes them look barbaric and uncivilized. Most importantly, this can hurt or kill others when you are doing it in a crowded city.
