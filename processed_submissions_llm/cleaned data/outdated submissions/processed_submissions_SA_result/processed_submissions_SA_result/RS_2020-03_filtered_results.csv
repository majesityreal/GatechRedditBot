There are three routes, and 30 students are taking the Ozark route, which has ATL as a stop along the way. They would be trekking all the way from Auburn, Alabama (6/12) and will be stopping near Atlanta for a couple nights, after which they would be headed north towards Tennessee. It’s a long ride from Auburn and its needless to say they deserve some rest. There is a link to the organizations page in this email if you want to look into Ozark route that these students will be trekking.

posts,"Gym Etiquette. TLDR:  There are too many people for the CRC. Be aware of how much time you spend on a singular machine, especially with big groups. Don’t block paths or areas, let people work in. Limit phone use to changing songs and returning texts. No YouTube videos or Netflix (unless you’re on a cardio machine then go for it). Do not use multiple machines at once. Don’t creep on girls. Happy lifting friends.


Hello people, I’m a 3rd year and I’ve been a CRC regular my entire time here. I’ve always noticed stuff in the CRC that ticks me off but I’ve always tried to ignore it. There are frankly way too many people at this school for the CRC but even if another was to be built i wouldn’t be here for it. To help (maybe?) I think it would be best that etiquette is explained to people that are just starting in the gym, or aren’t really sure how stuff works in there.

Time in between sets - Take only the length of breaks you need for your workout type. No rest should be longer than 5 minutes (extreme strength training, PRs) and most of the types of workouts I see in the CRC should have 30-90 seconds rest in between. It’s really crowded in there most of the day and taking long breaks backs everything up so much for everyone. The worst thing I see are people casually on their phones using social media or watching YouTube. (I saw one guy lay on a bench and watch and entire 13 minute video). People came to workout so don’t waste their time, it’s a shared space and you aren’t the only person putting in that sweet sweaty work. 

Large groups - At this school more than others I’ve worked out at (2 separate universities) people love to come in large groups. It’s completely fine to do that, however, keep in mind that you will be taking up much more time on the machines. In the same thread you will have “mandatory” breaks because someone else from your group will be using the machine. The problem comes from when a group comes in, grabs a machine, and then has 5 minutes in between separate people going because they are all conversing in between sets. I’ve seen many groups spend 30&lt; minutes on machines when they could have finished in 15. 

Amount of machines in use - the only time it’s acceptable to use more than one machine is on the cable machines or if you are in a group that is alternating (in a timely manner). Another part of this is to not take all the free weights. There is absolutely no need for anyone to have more than 2 sets of dumbbells at a bench. If you want to do a drop set then get in front of the weights and put them back after your set, then move to the next set. If you are in a large group, and there are two of the same machines (except cardio) don’t take more than one. Take turns and rotate at a reasonable speed and you’ll be fine.

Spatial awareness - things are tight in the CRC so this is extremely important. Do not hit anyone’s weight in the middle of a lift, I have had this happen 3 times and it’s an extreme injury hazard. It’s better to wait 20 seconds then tear someones rotator cuff because they are trying to stabilize the weight.

Putting the weights back - if you take something from somewhere, put it back where it goes. It’s not hard.

Blocking paths - don’t put weights in the way of walking paths or in front of the racquetball courts. That the only place weighted lunges can be done. Also don’t have your group of 15 form a plank circle in the way of everyone. 

The rest will be kind of miscellaneous things.

It’s ok to get creative with your workouts (using cable machines for low rows, having a set of dumbbells by your machine and doing sets while on you break for the machine). It is not ok to take bars from benches and racks to do curls. 

If someone asks to work in, be nice and let them.

If you notice someone waiting in the machine you are using and you know you won’t be done for a while, tell them and maybe offer to let them work in.

It’s ok to make noises while lifting but there is no need to scream “lightweight baby” at your 185 lb bench. 

If you need a spot, ask. Most people are happy to help.

Sometimes people might try to correct your form, it’s hard to tell if it’s because they are genuinely worried about you getting hurt or they want to flex their knowledge. I know if I see someone confused on how to do something I generally try to help.

Guys, the gym is not a place to hit on girls. Just don’t do it.

Ok so we clearly aren't undervalued by employers, but what kinda started me on this post was seeing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/fc4p5a/gt_start_up_facilities/) (I'm not ripping on the poster or anything, just wanted to give some context). I've seen a few GT vs UGA posts on this subreddit, so I was just wondering if the GT brand was undervalued, especially by people in-state (maybe cause GT is easier to get into in-state / a lot of people they know are here so it seems more status quo, idk). It just seems odd to me that someone would make a post comparing a world class program (in this case literally the #1 program) to one that was regionally known. Speaking as someone who grew up across the country, I never even heard of UGA before coming here since I didn't follow college sports at all. Meanwhile, it seems that every engineer I know from back home and even plenty of my teachers and a lot of my classmates in high school knew that Georgia Tech was a good engineering school (and of course I knew that too since I applied here). Not only that but I've met plenty of OOS kids here who've turned down places like MIT and ivy leagues to come here since it's cheaper. Idk, it's just something interesting that I've noticed but maybe just growing up around GT makes people not value it as much or something? Just a theory, I'm not upset about this or anything I just thought it was interesting and wanted to see if other people noticed the same thing.",positive,0.9878,03/02/2020

In light of the recent increase in cases of coronavirus worldwide, I want to update the campus on the measures we have taken to safeguard our students, faculty, and staff here in Atlanta, on our campuses abroad, and as part of the international programs being hosted throughout the world. 

First and foremost, we encourage everyone to follow appropriate preventative strategies, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): wash hands regularly, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, cover coughs and sneezes with tissues, avoid close contact with people who are sick, and stay home when experiencing symptoms of illness. If you have any illness – common cold, flu, cough – please stay home and take care of yourself until you are better. This will help slow the spread of all sickness. We are working with faculty to allow for excused absences in cases like these. 

Visit www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov to find out more about prevention measures. 

In addition, as previously communicated, we have canceled spring programs in China, South Korea, and Italy. We have also preemptively cancelled the China Summer Program. We continue to uphold the “Do Not Travel” notice to China issued by the University System of Georgia (USG) on Jan. 31 and have advised faculty to cancel any travel commitments to all countries currently under the CDC’s Level 3 notice — China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran. 

We have also established a coronavirus task force that will lead the preparation for and coordination of an Institute response in the event our operations are affected. I’ve asked my chief of staff, Frank Neville, to chair this group. Other members include:

• Rob Connolly, chief of police
• Erika Gravett, deputy director, Human Resources
• Laura Gustavson, emergency management coordinator, Emergency Management
• Kasey Helton, vice president, Campus Services
• Jennifer Herazy, chief administrative officer, Academic Affairs and Research
• Dr. Ben Holton, senior director, Health Services
• Pooja Juvekar, undergraduate president, Student Government Association
• Pinar Keskinocak, professor, Industrial and Systems Engineering
• Renee Kopkowski, vice president, Institute Communications 
• Keith McBride, chief of staff, Georgia Tech Research Institute
• Jim McGarrah, interim vice president, Information Technology
• Ajay Patel, director of purchasing, Purchasing and Procurement
• Jennifer Rhodes, project manager principal, Information Technology
• Narayan Shirolkar, graduate president, Student Government Association
• Will Smith, director, Emergency Management
• John Stein, vice president, Student Life and dean of students
• Nazia Zakir, assistant vice president, Environmental Health and Safety

The task force convened yesterday and has begun to engage key units to plan for the safety and well-being of our students, faculty and staff here in Atlanta and abroad, as well as to start continuity planning in case normal campus operations are interrupted. This work will help Georgia Tech prepare for a broader range of potential future concerns beyond the current public health threat. 

We are following the USG’s guidance concerning students and international travel. In the coming days, our task force will be considering its recommendations for faculty and staff who travel in the coming days. 

We are conducting an inventory of personal protective equipment, disinfectant cleaning supplies and hand sanitizer currently available in multiple departments on campus. We will be placing additional orders to ensure we have sufficient stockpiles of these items on hand. In addition, our Building Services custodial staff will alter building cleaning practices to focus more on surface cleanliness and disinfection.

We are coordinating all of our plans with federal and state authorities as well as the USG. They have been closely monitoring the ongoing outbreak in Asia and Europe and have offered direction to our institutions in line with guidance from the CDC, U.S. State Department, and the Georgia Department of Public Health.

We encourage you to visit the USG resource guide for the latest information concerning travel advisories and other guidance at www.usg.edu/coronavirus. 

As we continue to learn more, we’ll keep you updated through regular communications. Our communications archive is located at health.gatech.edu/coronavirus. Please direct any questions to publichealth@gatech.edu.

posts,"Considering Withdrawing from Exchange Program because of Coronavirus. **TL;DR**: Coronavirus is very close to my suburb and I’m starting to think I should withdraw from my study abroad. Withdrawing will mean that I get no credit for the semester, might have to pay back my loan, and will probably have to apply for readmission.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** The three from the chruch in my community has risen to seven overnight, including the pastor of the church. These seven are also just within my suburb; the Community of Madrid has 76 ~~56~~ cases according to the latest numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

This post is all the questions I've asked an advisor / financial aid office / registrar's office about what happens if I decide I should leave this program before GT decides I should leave this program.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m on an exchange program in Spain and coronavirus may or may not have just broken out in my suburb (news sources were saying it was corona yesterday, the councilor of health and the mayor refuse to confirm it today). This started to raise a lot of questions for me, and I thought it might help someone else in a similar situation if I list out all the questions I’ve asked staff and gotten answers to. At this point, I might be overreacting, but I wanted to gather this information so I could be making the best informed decisions as the situation develops.

I'm glad y'all in ATL have that task force ready to assess everything going on, but I feel like those of us on exchange are just being told that everything's fine, to listen to our host university, to wait for the CDC to put us to a Level 3 designation. I don't really trust that GT is watching us very closely or that anything is going to be done for us, and I wanted to be ready to make my own choices if I know that they're the right ones to make.

&amp;#x200B;

Some more background about this specific situation: the three people who may or may not have coronavirus were part of a church of 200 people, and I find it likely that they spread it to others within the church, and then they’re going to spread it...you get how disease spread works. Those three people just showed symptoms yesterday, and I have a feeling it’s going to blow up here in the coming weeks.

The study abroad programs that have been pulled, China, South Korea, and Italy, all reached Level 3 designation by the CDC. Programs in Japan, which has Level 2 designation, haven't been pulled. Spain has no designation at this time.

I fear that the problem in my suburb is going to get worse very quickly, but that perhaps the rest of Spain won’t. If that’s the case, maybe the CDC won’t feel the need to raise the entire country’s level to the point that GT will send us home, and I’m not sure I want to wait around for the problem to get bad enough that my host university cancels classes or the CDC says we should be sent home.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***The questions I’ve asked and gotten answers to:***

**At what point will Georgia Tech send us home?**  (asked to a GT education abroad advisor)

“We will continue to monitor and be in contact with \[the host university\] regarding any changes campus activities, ie suspension or cancellation of classes, etc. We will only require students to depart if the CDC and State Department’s travel advisories reach a Level 3. Currently, Spain is a Level 1 with the CDC and a Level 2 (which has been its level since October; has not increased since outbreak of coronavirus) with the State Department.”

This was the answer I was expecting. It's basically more of the same, We're just going to wait until the CDC says something but otherwise you should be there or it's your decision to not be.

I’m still not sure exactly when the CDC decides to start assigning levels to different places.

&amp;#x200B;

**If my parents and I don’t feel it’s safe for me here anymore and want me to leave, what happens?**  (asked to the same GT education abroad advisor)

“If you decide to depart, you will need to discuss with \[the host university\] if there are any options to complete your semester remotely. I have not heard that \[the host university\] is or will be offering distance-learning options. If they will not be offering this option, and you are not able to complete your semester, you would be withdrawn from FS4000, as you will not be able to transfer any credits for the semester. Please note that there would be FinAid implications if this were the case.”

I have asked my host university whether completing the semester remotely is an option, but have yet to receive a reply. They had made it fairly clear at the beginning of the semester that distance exams were never allowed under any circumstances, from which I can extrapolate that they don't have the infrastructure in place to facilitate distance learning. I asked nonetheless, because perhaps they are making preparations in the case that this becomes more widespread.

&amp;#x200B;

**If I withdraw from my semester, what are the implications for financial aid? Will I need to pay back some of my loan? Will I lose eligibility for future loans?** (asked to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid)

“Under normal circumstances there is a refund process up until March 11th, at which point 100% of your loan would be retained [http://bursar.gatech.edu/student/refunds/refund\_Spring20.pdf](http://bursar.gatech.edu/student/refunds/refund_Spring20.pdf) …. On the other hand, if by chance the \[courses and fees are waived or cancelled\], your loan would simply be returned to lender.”

So, it doesn’t seem as though I’ll lose my financial aid for the future. I think if I withdraw and the program doesn’t get cancelled, I may have to pay back some of the loan or face a hold on my account, but if I wait until after March 11th maybe I don’t have to repay any of it? Not really sure.

&amp;#x200B;

**What other information can you give me?**  (asked in the same email to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid)

“Withdrawing from the program could also impact pace, and according to our SAP policy, eligibility would be suspended if pace goes below 75% for two consecutive semesters, [https://finaid.gatech.edu/satisfactory-academic-progress](https://finaid.gatech.edu/satisfactory-academic-progress) .”

**Can you further explain pace?** (asked in a follow-up email to OSFA)

“Pace is referring to your completion rate, which is credit hours earned divided by hours attempted. “

They actually checked my pace specifically and gave me an update on what it would mean for me if I were to withdraw from this semester entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

**In the case that \[the host university\] classes are cancelled, what options will I have? Will I lose the entire semester? Will equivalent online courses through Tech be available?**  (asked to the same GT education abroad advisor)

“If \[the host university\] decides to cancel classes for the remainder of the semester and cannot offer any options for you to finish the semester remotely, you would not be able to enroll in GT courses…. If they do not offer any options for remotely completing your semester, you would “lose” your semester if you decide to leave early or if you are required to return home.”

So, while I heard that other programs were able to take courses online when they got cancelled I won’t be able to at this point, probably because we’re so far along in the semester.

&amp;#x200B;

**If I withdraw from my semester, is that considered being unenrolled for the semester? In other words, if I withdraw and do not take summer classes at the Institute, will I need to apply for readmission for the fall semester?**  (asked to the Office of the Registrar)

“Missing two or more consecutive terms requires re-admission. The link below provides information regarding Georgia Tech’s Re-Admission Policy and Procedures. [https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/readmission-form](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/readmission-form) ”

I have asked for more clarity on this, since they didn’t directly answer whether withdrawing from the semester counts as being unenrolled for the semester. I’ve heard through the grapevine that some students that had been studying in South Korea will need to apply for re-admission if they don’t take summer classes, so I assume that withdrawing from the semester counts as being unenrolled. There are some threads within this subreddit regarding readmission.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really not sure if anyone else is in a similar situation or needs this information, but I was tired of all the hearsay and not being able to understand the protocol from different corners of Gatech's websites. I found the answers I needed, and wanted to share them in case anyone else needs them too.

posts,"Discussion about coronavirus. First, I am very pessimistic about the situation. I closely follow the news since the beginning of the outbreak in China.

I believe an outbreak in Atlanta is inevitable. The problem is that the two confirmed cases were not quarintined immediately at the airport, which means others on the same flight are highly likely to get infected already, but not quarintined yet. It usually takes 7-14 days to develop a symptom, yet infected people with no symptom can still infect others.

My suggestion is to wear a mask, even though the CDC guidline does NOT recommend do so. My reasoning is that:

(1) It is actually extremely difficult to avoid touching your face/mouth/nose in daily life. Wearing a mask means your mouth and nose are covered, which greatly reduces the possibility to touch them.

(2) A case study on *Lancet*, *The spread of the virus in a family cluster* [https://www.thelancet.com/infographics/coronavirus](https://www.thelancet.com/infographics/coronavirus) shows that the only person not infeced, among a group of 7 family members, ""wear a surgical mask for most of the time"".

(3) There is a reported case in Ningbo, Zhejiang ([https://www.vice.com/en\_us/article/v747jx/chinese-authorities-say-it-takes-just-15-seconds-for-coronavirus-to-spread](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v747jx/chinese-authorities-say-it-takes-just-15-seconds-for-coronavirus-to-spread)) that a person is infected with only 15-second exposure to a confirmed case, both not wearing a mask.",negative,-0.9771,03/03/2020

posts,"Fostering Pets. Hi guys, I know that with everything going on about the Corona virus, other problems in the world seem sort of insignificant but I’d like to get a quick minute of attention about something that deeply troubles me. Every year thousands of families across the United States are displaced due to natural disasters (There was a terrible tornado which just hit Nashville).

Now you might think that this problem has been addressed really well; I mean thats why we have organizations like FEMA and emergency response personnel right? I’d have to agree with you, they do their job extremely well and I respect all of them and thank them for all that they do. There is one thing though that sort of gets swept under the rug and forgotten about in the wake of disaster. Pets. After a large-scale natural disaster, a lot of people lose their homes and although they often are able to find a safe place to live, they usually have to say goodbye to part of their family. Dogs, cats, and plethora of other pets, are simply given up to shelters and for adoption because their owners simply have no other place for them.

A couple of friends and I, thought that the idea of losing a member of your family that you love amidst already losing your home and a majority of your way of your life was simply deplorable. So, we’re humbly asking all of you if any of our fellow yellow jackets would be interested in fostering displaced pets or know someone who’d be willing to. If you know someone who’s also facing that impossible choice of letting go of a loved one simply because they have no place to keep them right now, we’d love to hear from them too. If you’re interested at all, we’d love it if you could take a second of your time and just let us know who you are at [fosterlink](https://mailchi.mp/f209b65bd7d6/fosterlink).

posts,"Recruitment for on-campus study with compensation (upto $80). If you are a Georgia Tech student and use an android phone that is not a One Plus or Moto G5, you are requested to participate in a research study, which can go up to 4 months. The intention of this study is to understand what role of eating experience play on your mental health by providing you a smartwatch and asking for daily and weekly responses to a quick questionnaire. A typical Georgia Tech student has a very busy schedule and it becomes challenging for researchers to obtain self-reported information from them in a natural setting about their eating habits. Your participation will inform us about how eating affects your well-being and using that information we will investigate how eating habits in a college population affect their well-being.


You will receive a $5 gift card for your participation each week. If you drop out before the first week, you will not receive any compensation. For getting a gift card for a week, you need to be enrolled for the entire week. Partial participation will not be considered for compensating for that respective week. You can earn a maximum of $80 from this study.

IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN A EUROPEAN UNION (EU) COUNTRY, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS STUDY DUE TO THE GENERAL PROTECTION DATA REGULATION (GDPR).

posts,"Free Campus Food Delivery! (Gu's Dumplings, Zunzi's). Tired of the lacking of dining options? Terrified of the Student Center closing in the Summer? We've teamed up with the [best local restaurants](https://i.imgur.com/15Wsdml.jpg) to offer exclusive deals and are delivering lunch to campus for **zero delivery fees!**

**How does it work?**

[Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJe0WigA3gHSHz7gG-1fK7fWPJX1BjFnUMftFFVOtxoXcwkA/viewform). Next week, we will deliver Gu's Dumplings and Zunzi's (South African subs). Simply place an order before 11am (or the day before for a further 10% discount), and we will get you your meal to anywhere on campus. All of our food will be in insulated bags, so your food is sure to remain warm and fresh.

**What can I order**

[Here are some of your options](https://i.imgur.com/RR2YYAk.jpg). These custom boxes are discounted to be lower-than-menu price even after delivery! You are still able to order any item from the restaurants at menu price.

**How are there no delivery fees?**

Typically, there is a delivery fee as well as commission taken from the restaurant to pay drivers. Since we are sending multiple orders at once, we can pay the driver a full wage without relying on fees or tips. Additionally, our offerings save the kitchen time and effort since they can prepare food in bulk, which further discounts our meals.

Gonna get a high B in another subject

I'm worried if I get a B in the easy A subject above, and a C in the Linear Algebra course, My GPA this sem gonna drop below 2.7 (2.66) and get me into Academic Probation and that might cause funding/assistantship problems? (My current GPA is 3.33 - 1 A and 2 Bs, so overall would be 3.0)

So should I brazen it out? Especially since the Prof in Linear Algebra says she gives 80% of the class As and Bs.

posts,"Check out Hydroponics!. Hey everyone!

In the hustle of exams, homework and classes, the issue of climate change and the pressure it will put on the world's food resources is often put on the back burner. As the planet warms, the world experiences an increasing amount of substantial heat waves which hinders crop growth and decreases arable land and freshwater supply. Thus, it is necessary to optimize food production in order to sustain the growing population. One of the best ways to do this is through hydroponic farming. 

Hydroponics is an alternative farming method that grows plants in water instead of soil. Hydroponics systems can be vertically stacked, decreasing the amount of growing space necessary. In addition, hydroponics are extremely water efficient, using substantially less water than traditional field farming. Hydroponics can also be grown indoors, allowing anyone to become a farmer!

Because of the perceived benefits of hydroponics, one might wonder why hydroponics is not a more common resource of food production. One major reason is the difficulty of getting into hydroponics. It is a process with a steep learning curve and many unusual issues so new users and farmers run into many problems maintaining their system and building up their supply chain.

I am part of a Grand Challenges group at Georgia Tech that is tackling the problem of the difficulty of entering into hydroponics. If you or someone you know would be interested in learning more about our project or hydroponics, find us at the link below and sign up for the monthly newsletter or contact us through our email [ankaponics@gmail.com](mailto:ankaponics@gmail.com). Please let us know about any comments or suggestions  you have for us moving forward.

**TLDR**, check out [ankaponics.com](http://ankaponics.com/) if you’re interested in hydroponics. You can grow space lettuce hydroponically. If you saw this post already, it got removed accidentally. Sorry about that.

posts,"Pro-Life: Ryan Bomberger - founder of Radiance Foundation speaking this Thurs!. **Students for Life** @ GT is hosting an exciting speaker - **Ryan Bomberger** \- this Thursday, March 12th, at 7 pm in Bill Moore SCC Presidents Suite C&amp;D. As a pro-life and civil rights advocate, Ryan believes abortion is a social injustice, and this will be the topic he discusses, providing the GT community with a new look at social justice in the modern age.

Ryan will be taking a look at abortion as a human rights issue from his unique perspective as a man conceived in sexual violence, placed by his birth mother into a multi-racial adoptive family of 15 (10 of his 13 brothers and sisters were also adopted!). His work has garnered massive media coverage from The New York Times, USA Today, LA Times, CNN, MSNBC and more.

We believe pro-life feminism is something everyone should embrace! **We welcome all viewpoints and experiences**, and strongly encourage our attendees to bring questions – even the most difficult ones from those that identify as pro-choice.

This is not a political event and Ryan won't be backing any specific legislation or candidates. Here's the FB event for more info: [event](https://www.facebook.com/events/573215633405257/)

posts,"Recovering from a lot of skipped classes. My class attendance has been terrible this semester. In the past I've tried my best to attend every lecture, but this semester fucking SUCKS. I feel disconnected from my classmates and professors, which made it easy to stop going when my personal life took a downturn and I couldn't bring myself to want to do anything. I'm feeling a little better now and want to pick myself up, but there is such a backlog of work and reading that I feel hopeless at ever properly catching up. 

It's been over a month since I've consistently attended any of my classes, and longer than that since I've done any reading or assignments that weren't absolutely essential, and even then I've skipped some important assignments. I have no good excuse for skipping so much, so I'd rather not ask my professors for help, especially since I've never spoken to most of them. I'm trying to pick up where the classes are at now, but it's still difficult to keep myself focused and I keep thinking/panicking about all the other crap I have to catch up on. It doesn't help that attendance and/or participation count in all of these courses. Anyone have advice?

I thought it asked for my party affiliation, so I marked ""Non-partisan."" But when the poll worker saw my paper, he scoffed at me and said ""This is democratic primary."" I knew that, so I asked ""Isn't Georgia open-primary?"" However, he just ignored me and only insisted that I make changes to my paper and sign my initials, which I did.

Is there a Guest wifi on campus, specifically in the Culc building, or a way to request internet access for a day?",positive,0.6281,03/11/2020

We have a guide on our registration page that can help you figure out which kind of time reporting you will use if you don't know yet. You can access that guide right [here](http://transformation.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/how_to_determine_time_reporting_and_absence_requesting_method_in_oneusg_connect.pdf).

Also, a quick reminder that GTRI Student Employees are exempt from either of the clock trainings but it is still recommended to take the ""Intro to ESS"" course.

Please ask me questions if you have any, and have a great day!

Everyone I talk to about the process of getting shirts for their student organizations has a horror story about Georgia Tech Licensing and Trademarks. It's practically impossible for any student org to have Georgia Tech's trademarks on their shirts. And the Licensing and Trademarks office is extremely unhelpful, and seem borderline incompetent with trademark law. It's as if GT doesn't care about what their students do at all. God forbid you try to even make the slightest reference to a yellow jacket in your logo.

posts,"Message from the provost to instructors: ""Academic Continuity Resources &amp; Planning"". ***This message is sent on behalf of Provost Bras to all Georgia Tech Instructors of Record:***

Dear Colleagues and Instructional Faculty: 

As the situation around the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak evolves, it is critical that we prepare to ensure academic continuity for our students should we need to restrict access to our campus. At this point, no such restriction is in place, and we continue to assess the situation closely and evaluate options with the University System of Georgia.This is the message that you should share with students. Additionally, current information is always available at [health.gatech.edu/coronavirus](http://health.gatech.edu/coronavirus). 

From an academic standpoint, our first priority must be to minimize any impact on the academic progress of our students. Leadership in each College and School is working to identify all relevant, degree-granting, for-credit courses and determine alternative delivery plans for each course and section.

An Academic Continuity Work Group has also been formed by team members from Georgia Tech Professional Education, the Office of Information Technology (OIT), and the Center for Teaching and Learning. The group is creating an action plan so that, if needed, we can continue instruction by supporting faculty-to-student and student-to-student interaction using existing and familiar tools like Canvas, Kaltura, and BlueJeans conferencing.

Information sessions, workshops, and individual consultation sessions will be made available this week and next week for any faculty member who needs training or refreshing on the available tools. The OIT Enterprise Service Desk will serve as the single point of access for technical assistance.

Resource documents for students, faculty, and staff will be uploaded at[services.gatech.edu](http://services.gatech.edu/) as soon as they are available. Your College and/or School leadership stands ready to assist you to get the resources and training you need.

We are monitoring this situation very closely and are appreciative of your support of each other and our students as we deal with the inevitable uncertainty. We will communicate further as soon as additional details are available. 

Please reach out to me or via [publichealth@gatech.edu](mailto:publichealth@gatech.edu) if you have any questions or concerns. 

Regards, 

Rafael L. Bras

So I was given the conditional transfer pathway for 2020 fall meaning I will be at tech next semester as long as I meet the requirements and submit my application. However there is circulation that Georgia colleges may turn to online courses for the rest of the semester. I am currently taking a lab class (1 credit hour) to meet not only my 30 hour credit requirement but also my lab science course requirement. I also read that lab classes will not be online but rather we would have to complete the course at a later date (summer/next fall) however all of my requirements are due by the end of the spring semester and no later. This predicament is the same for many other conditional applicants currently and we are all wondering what would happen to us if classes were to go online and we are not able to meet our course requirements.,negative,-0.0516,03/11/2020
