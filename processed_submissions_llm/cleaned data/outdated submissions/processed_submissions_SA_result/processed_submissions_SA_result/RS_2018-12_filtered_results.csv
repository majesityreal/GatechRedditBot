posts,"Looking to swap 6-person apartment for a 4-person. Hi all,

So my roommates and I are currently assigned to a 6-person room, but there are only four of us (our two other roommates won't be on campus next semester.) I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask if there are any groups out there in a four that are looking to get into a six... maybe a switch would be possible? We'd prefer west but would probs consider anywhere.

posts,"Were any of your parents against you co-oping?. Title + my parents are concerned about ""graduating late"" + ""not having friends when back on campus"" even though for the first, I feel like a lot of people at GT end up graduating late anyway and for the second it just depends on how you keep in touch?

Also, for those of you who co-op'd out of state (like out of GA and also out of your home state if you're OOS), how did housing at your co-op location work out?

Kinda stressed right now because I do want to co-op because I believe the experience is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; graduating early but I need to talk it through with my parents b/c (lol) Asian and also don't want to seem (to them) that I'm just randomly going off on my own, any help is appreciated, esp as it regards to parental concerns and talking it through with them, thanks!
