posts,"Should I retake the GRE?. Hi everybody,

I'll likely be applying to the Masters in Public Policy program soon and was looking for some input on my measurables. GRE was 167 V, 154 Q, and I anticipate analytical writing being pretty high as well. Undergrad was 3.7 or something (don't remember exactly), and I double-majored in journalism and Spanish. I've worked in journalism for three or so years since graduating.

I see that the MSPP emphasizes its ""analytical"" nature and that it seeks students with ""analytical"" backgrounds, so I was wondering if I should try to boost my Q score for that reason. Thanks in advance for your input!

I am a student who recently got out of the Army with a medical discharge. I am 28 years old and only has 9 college credit hours that I have got while I was in the Army. I could not go to school before joining the Army due to the financial problem. Now that I have GI Bill and much more, I am willing to put my maximum effort to get back on track. GA Tech has always been my dream school and I was really happy to see Veterans Pathway Program. I would really appreciate if anyone could share the story who got in through this program.

I will start going to community school starting summer semester.  I am debating if I should go to Perimeter, GGC, or GTC to acquire the minimum 30 hours credit.

posts,"Financial Aid Warning. Hey guys, may be totally irrelevant to most people, but if you happen to be eligible for the Tech promise program (aka family income &lt; $33,300 and in state applicant) you “qualify” for the full ride to Georgia Tech! Congratulations but there’s also some minor stipulations you should watch out for. I was denied that and was told, after later contact, it was because my parents filed form 1040 instead of a 1040a or a 1040ez. Wonderful! So my denial for it was justified except for the fact that 1040a and 1040ez are just a less detailed version of 1040 AND they removed those forms as of 2018! If you’re relying on receiving promise scholarship for the following year, my advice for you is to 

1) hound the financial aid office about these forms and such over phone/in person, if you email they usually avoid the topic and give you some half hearted answers
2) contact them relentlessly about the promise award, some friends I’ve met at Tech knew about receiving the award as early as February
3) have a backup because Tech will not offer any other substantial financial aid to you even with an EFC of 0 and a family income less than 18k
4) dont fill out the financial aids form last minute, chances are if you cannot use the IRS retrieval tool and are low income, you are the target population of financial verification form and you will run pay priority deadline if you’re not careful

Obviously I am also a disgruntled student/individual but I can also understand the limitation of funds for in state student. For those curious about OOS costs, the advantage of in state is really primarily Zell/Hope which covers tuition however this is not something that Tech offers. With the exception of Tech promise for low income students, most if not all (at least to my knowledge) institutional aid are given to OOS students or are equally competitive between OOS and in state. Flat out, if you’re in state and not below $33,330 income, very few students receive substantial institutional aid. ",positive,0.9896,01/02/2019

posts,"Interested in M.S. Electrical Engineering Online Program (Specialization in Antennas/Wireless Systems/RF) @ GTech. Hello everybody,I recently graduated from UC San Diego with my B.S. in Electrical Engineering. I also recently moved to the Atlanta area and started working here. I am interested in pursuing my M.S. in Electrical Engineering at GTech's online program. I am not sure how GTech divides their specializations, but I am looking for something that is related to one or more of these areas: Antennas/Wireless Systems/RF as that is what my work relates to.

Although it might be a little early to think about M.S. since I just started working, I want to be prepared. I am planning to work for a couple years to get some experience, take the GRE, and apply to the online M.S. EE program @ GTech. The online program would work better for me since I work full time/travel for work.

Here are some things I would really appreciate some insight on:

1. **Academic Rigor/Workload:**Since I will be working full-time + traveling, I was wondering if there is anyone that has experience balancing full-time work and the online MS program. I'd like to know what to expect so that I can anticipate what I can/can not handle.
2. **Financial Aid:**  Just interested to see how this would work. Would I need to be a TA/do research under a professor to get scholarships/grants?
3. **Quality of professors for M.S. in Electrical Engineering:** Honest opinions about this would be greatly appreciated.

Any other insight on stuff like in-state tuition requirements (I'm looking that up and will probably contact GTech office about it), IEEE Antennas &amp; Propagation Society involvement, etc.. would be greatly appreciated!",positive,0.9902,01/02/2019
