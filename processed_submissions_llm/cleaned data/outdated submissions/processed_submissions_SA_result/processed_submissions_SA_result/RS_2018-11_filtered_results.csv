posts,Looking For Math Course. I’m interested in taking a course on mathematical tiling as a free elective. Or a course that covers it. I’m looking ahead towards my last semester at gt whenever that is. I have already taken combinatorics and the cs discrete course. I’m currently taking the second course in linear which is math 3406. And in the spring I’m going to take math2603 which is the math version of discrete math as a free elective. And I’m taking difeq in the spring. I have also taken multivar. I’m a cs major and my threads are theory and mod/sim. Probably going to graduate December 2020. Any suggestions for what course I should take?,positive,0.886,11/01/2018

posts,"Let's talk about the student employees. Look, I get it. GT is a hard school and, a lot of the time, we aren't in good moods. However, I've noticed (this semester especially) that the student employees in the student center are just downright moody and annoyed at the students that they service. Whether it's at the package pickup window, the info desk, tech rec, etc. - everywhere I've gone this semester in the student center, there's been an employee that's been rude to me. I've even gotten to the point where I recognize the few have been nice to me and only go to pick up a package or whatever when they're working, because otherwise it's just not worth it to be in a shitty mood for the rest of the day.

posts,"anyone feels like the ""ask TA"" and ""TAs are also student"" things are like a paradox/deadlock?. Maybe it's approaching the time of the semester again...as a CS major every class is like 100\~200 students participating or even more. For projects if we want more clarification or guidance, professors would say ""TAs are responsible for blahblah..you should go ask them"". It's understandable right? A lecturer cannot take care of 200+ students. But when we get to TA office hour, there are sometimes not enough TAs to ask quesion on exam or projects. Sometimes it takes several weeks to grade a project. It's also understandable because TAs are also students. They are busier cuz most of them are seniors or juniors.

However considering you have limited characters for your statement, is it okay to just refer to the thing by its acronym?

For instance I'm applying for the MS in AE, and there's a lab called the Aerospace System Design Laboratory which is also called ASDL. Should I just call is ASDL from the start and save character space? Cuz the person reading it should know what it is.

posts,"How did you choose the right college for you?. I am a junior in high school right now and I am so overwhelmed by all these amazing colleges that have what I would like major in (Biomedical Engineering). I am in state for Georgia Tech which is an amazing school, but I don't know if it would be realistic in terms of my GPA now (3.9) and also because I'm looking to apply for med school, but if I end up changing my mind I can get a great engineering degree for little debt and I can study abroad cheaply. Another school I am considering is the university of Florida. I am not sure of the rigor of their BME program, but I think it won't be as tough as the one at tech, but I still expect it to be challenging. Of course I will be paying out of state tuition which is no fun :( but with university of Florida having wayyyy more options if i choose to not major in bme anymore during school and can help me achieve a higher gpa for med school. I really want to study abroad and both of these schools offer the countries I would like to visit, but hmmm idk I just feel stuck.

Student seating will be on a first come, first served basis with your valid BuzzCard.
Only the first ~900 students will be allowed to enter. When the student ticket allotment has been reached for a game, no more students will be allowed in under the student ticket program. If the student section reaches capacity yet inventory remains in non-student sections, students will be given a ticket as they enter to sit in a reserved, non-student section seat.
You will use your BuzzCard for entry to all games. It must be a *valid student ID (*current student, paid athletic fee). No physical ticket or printout will be required.
