posts,"What‚Äôs the point. This was probably my best semester. I quit smoking all things and I‚Äôm not drinking anymore. I showed up to every class. I was studying consistently and actually learning something. It‚Äôs still not enough.

I just checked what I can get in each of my classes and I‚Äôm at 2 As and 3 Bs. My gpa is going to drop even though I‚Äôve tried my best. I just don‚Äôt know what the point is. Why am I working my ass off if the grading scheme for my courses makes an A so hard to achieve. Tech doesn‚Äôt do B+‚Äôs either. 2 of my B‚Äôs are going to be around an 87. I feel like I should just stop doing assignments at this point. All non-tests have such little weight that getting zeroes on them wouldn‚Äôt hurt me. 

Should I just transfer? I feel like I‚Äôm doing just as much or more than those who I see succeeding, but I‚Äôm still struggling to maintain a 3.2. Am I dumb? Should things be just as easy and straightforward as my professors and TAs say they are? Does anyone even give a shit? 

I‚Äôve just resigned myself to the fact that some alumni is going to tell me that I‚Äôm an idiot and that I deserve the grade I‚Äôm getting. So thanks in advance gt alum. I am dumb.",negative,-0.9307,03/31/2020
posts,"My one pet peeve about online classes. Today I just had an online math exam through Gradescope and I just realized how easy it is cheat. I am an honest person and I would never cheat. But it would ridiculously easy to get someone else to take your exam for you or even communicate with other classmates during the test
.The professor could give a really hard test like mine did and the class average could still be high because of cheating. I think professors should take that into consideration when it comes to curving. It would be unfair for honest students like me to study and completely fail a really hard exam while others are putting in absolutely no work and getting 100s which would mean that the class is not curved.

For example,

* Are they a big time commitment?

* How is the engagement of the professor different compared to undergrad courses?

posts,"Do students use busyness or time pressure as a status symbol at Tech?. Hi r/gatech, 

I'm trying to get a sense of whether Gatech students perceive busyness here at Georgia Tech as a sign of status. I'm a professor here--I teach the happiness course--and I was trying to do a formal research project with four students this semester about this question. However, given the current COVID-19 situation, we weren't able to launch that project. 

We were curious about this topic because there's some psychological research suggesting that upper class professionals (like doctors and lawyers) use busyness as a sign of status. 

Here are examples of what I mean at Tech:

* Someone takes a high number of credit hours because they expect people will admire them for doing that
* Someone does a lot of extracurriculars because it looks good
* Someone brags about how little sleep they get or how late they sleep as to show how busy they are.
* Someone hides the fact that they go to sleep at a reasonable time
* Someone conspicuously shows how busy their schedule is, e.g., talking about how many things they have to do or how many events they have on their schedule.
* Someone exaggerating or misrepresenting how busy they are

Does this seem common at Tech? By common, I mean it's more than just a few people doing this. Feel free to drop any anecdotes. I'm not going to use any of this for a formal published analysis. I'm just trying to informally figure out how people feel about the issue. Thanks!",positive,0.9428,04/01/2020

posts,"Housing Impact Update [Post 8]. Good evening all,

It's been a tough few weeks-there's no getting around that. I do hope that each and every one of you (as well as your families) are healthy and well. We've gotten quite a few questions regarding current on-campus living conditions and below you'll find the answers we've received. For our recent residents now residing off campus, be on the lookout for an email in the near future regarding a few initiatives we're working on to improve off-campus community and make the best with the circumstances we've been given.

**Q&amp;A Regarding On-Campus Living Conditions, Moving &amp; Residential Support**

*What cleaning measures are being taken before residents move into their new assignments?* 

* In order to maintain social distancing practices, only one person will be assigned to an apartment.¬†This will allow everyone to have access to their own bathroom, kitchen and¬†living room.¬†Each of these apartments will be¬†thoroughly cleaned¬†by Housing staff¬†before a resident moves in. The Housing Custodial staff use a disinfectant that is listed¬†by the Center for Biocide Chemistry as a¬†Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Fighting Product.¬†Housing Custodial staff¬†have been and will continue¬†to clean high touch/commonly touched areas multiple times a day¬†in occupied buildings. 

*Since we're moving residents to new buildings, will new parking spaces be available to those that have cars on campus?* 

* Students will be able to contact Parking and have their parking lot changed. Call¬†404-385-7275¬†to have your lot assignment changed.¬† 

 *How should current residents go about requesting assistance for moving to their new assignment?*

* Boxes and tape are still available to residents¬†at this time. Students¬†seeking additional assistance¬†should place a request at¬†[information@housing.gatech.edu](mailto:information@housing.gatech.edu),¬†and we will do our best to¬†accommodate¬†you.¬†   

*Which buildings are being utilized for consolidation?*

* The buildings being used are Maulding, all Eighth¬†Apts, North Avenue North, North Avenue West, GLC, and¬†Tenth and Home. 

*Of the residents staying on campus, what percentage are being asked to move?*

* Approximately¬†40% of students that¬†were approved to stay were asked to move. 

*Given that the moving time tickets could interfere with online class sessions, if neither of the options that are provided for residents to select are available to them, will individuals be able to request an entirely new set of options by emailing* [*information@housing.gatech.edu*](mailto:information@housing.gatech.edu)*?* 

* Residents will be able to select¬†time ticket preferences within the April 1st¬†- April¬†3rd timeframe¬†using the link in the email with their new assignment. If¬†they have any questions, they can email HRL at¬†[information@housing.gatech.edu](mailto:information@housing.gatech.edu).

*With a limited number of SSMs on campus, what resources will be provided from HRL for individuals on campus for the duration of this semester?* 

* We will have about 40 RAs on campus to assist with resident needs. They will be placed within our consolidated communities. We look forward to offering¬†virtual opportunities for residents to connect with each other¬†to limit all¬†physical¬†interaction in the halls. We will also have Hall Directors on campus to support residents.¬†   

As always, should you have any additional questions, you can add them to the [Housing Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/fle8pu/megathread_questions_related_to_housing/) or drop them below and we'll answer questions as appropriate. At this time, we do not have any further information regarding the status of summer housing. If you have any areas of advocacy you believe RHA can help out with, you can send them over to [advocacy@rha.gatech.edu](mailto:advocacy@rha.gatech.edu).

posts,"Unemployment for Student-Employees. Hello! Resident tax law nerd here with some good news for GT student-employees. I‚Äôm not sure if any of y‚Äôall have heard about H. R. 748 ‚ÄúCARES Act‚Äù that is now public law 116-136.

This is the law that is providing the $1,200 stimulus checks. Unfortunately, most of us won‚Äôt qualify for it. If you could be claimed as a dependent in 2019, you won‚Äôt get the check now. If you can be claimed as a dependent in 2020, you won‚Äôt get the credit then.

However, there is another section of the law that enhances unemployment compensation. Normally, student-employees would be ineligible for unemployment because Georgia state law excludes student-employees from unemployment insurance coverage.

But the CARES Act extends federal unemployment coverage to individuals ‚Äú...who \[aren‚Äôt\] eligible for regular compensation...under State...law...and provides self-certification that the individual is otherwise able to work and available to work...except that the individual is unemployed, partially unemployed, or unable or unavailable to work because...the individual is unable to reach the place of employment because of a quarantine imposed as a direct result of the COVID-19 public health emergency...or the individual‚Äôs place of employment is closed as a direct result of the COVID-19 public health emergency‚Äù

Weekly benefits are equal to the amount calculated under Georgia state law plus $600.

The Georgia Department of Labor has signed an agreement with the US Department of Labor to accept these expanded benefits. They are waiting on guidance from USDOL before making the system live.

I am not a lawyer and can not guarantee how this will play out, but based on my reading of the law, I‚Äôm fairly certain we will qualify for this expanded coverage. I would recommend applying; the worst they can say is ‚Äúno.‚Äù

The Georgia Department of Labor's website is [dol.georgia.gov](https://dol.georgia.gov). As mentioned, they don't have an application process yet--pending US DoL guidance--but any claims approved can be backdated.",positive,0.9553,04/03/2020

Therefore, we will accept courses for transfer credit that were completed in online format taken in the Spring 2020 or Summer 2020 term. The actual dates may vary since some institutions are on semesters and some on quarters, and their calendars vary in other ways. If the course is not listed on the [transfer equivalency site](https://registrar.gatech.edu/info/transfer-credit-equivalency-tables), the course must be submitted for review to [Transfer Credit site](https://transfercredit.gatech.edu/).

posts,"[?] Job Resources for Alumni.  Hey everyone,

I'll keep the backstory short and simple. I graduated back in 2017 with a degree in Management. A few months after graduation a loved one passed away, which pretty drastically derailed my life. I spent the next two years working minimum-wage roles (Publix, Walmart) while also working to improving my mental health to the point of holding a professional role.

In light of the COVID-19 crisis, I've started to have a really rough time with my job search. Things were going well with interviews and replies, but now I've noticed far less responses in the ambiguity.

Are there any worthwhile resources available to alumni or recent graduates? Any suggestions or direction would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",positive,0.9438,04/03/2020
posts,"Gauging interest... Work on SolidWorks certifications while social distancing?. EDIT: Link is up, join the class here. Content will be available starting May 11th (or maybe earlier)

 **https://gatech.instructure.com/enroll/DTCD39** 

Since Tech is continuing with distance learning over the summer, it's a good time to build some tangible skills that you might not otherwise be able to budget the time to develop.

I teach a SolidWorks certification course which is going to be offered over the summer. It's for my BME students only, but I'm considering ways to scale it so more students can take advantage of this time to build skills.

SolidWorks recommends 150 hours of instruction before attempting the CSWA exam, but several of my students every semester earn the much harder certification, the CSWP, with much less than 150 hours invested. Y'all smart.

What I'm considering doing is to build a repository of self-study materials:

1. resources from LinkedIn Learning available through Tech
2. resources available through SolidWorks
3. additional content I will create which will help fill in the gaps I've found in both of those curricula.

Students could then earn the CSWA and CSWP exam at their own pace, and at no cost, as long as you have currently active Georgia Tech login credentials (you do not need to be actively enrolled over the summer).

I don't think I can handle helping 1000 students this summer... but 50? Sure. 100? Maybe.... Just trying to see what you all think the level of enthusiasm for this would be.

Hi everyone! Here‚Äôs the full story of the ‚ÄúCorona Kittens,"" as well as some updates and some cute pictures for those who have been asking. 

TLDR; Kittens are doing great and if you want to help out, please send me some wet kitten food via Amazon wishlist or money via Venmo. (@xoykon)  
(Sort by highest priority to see our desperate needs)  
[https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2A77V28XWW5AB‚Ä¶](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2A77V28XWW5AB?ref_=wl_share&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Q0B3ab6E57m3PT_pMqD64XfYO2GqKf_aZNESq2O0FCtRWa3fMwe1x1wo)

About two weeks ago I was on my way to a meeting when I got a text about kittens outside the building I was in. I jumped up and dashed outside to see what was going on, and there I met five precious nuggets. They had been spotted with their mother by passerby students. The curious students approached and the mother fled. It became immediately apparent that the kittens were not yet weaned and much too young to be away from their mother (about 2-3 weeks). The students cuddled the kittens and when I approached were very open about the experience.

I immediately rushed to my car and grabbed one of my cat traps. After seeing the kittens I knew exactly who their mother was: a feral molly I have had my eyes on for about a year. She is a beautiful dilute calico, and last year she gave birth to a darling orange tom who also made an appearance that day. I scooped up the kittens into a carrier and placed a trap at the open end in order to lure the mother cat into the trap. A friend and I watched the trap closely, but it began to rain, and the mother cat was very frightened by all the activity. The group I work with at Tech has been trying to trap this female for over two years, so catching her and finally desexing her would be a huge feat. It would mean she would be happily able to live her life baby-free, and that no more kittens would be born in the rain.

I did not catch her on the first day. She evaded the trap and disappeared into the night, despite weak cries of hunger from her babies. I took the five small bundles home and bottle-fed them throughout the night, hoping they would survive without their mother. The next day, I scooped them all up after a warm meal and stuck them back in the carrier. This time, I placed two traps at the opening of the carrier and I waited... for hours and hours. Around 4 p.m. I grew tired and hungry after watching the traps all afternoon so I quickly ran to the Student Center to grab lunch. I returned to my post with my tacos and began to scarf them down, only to be interrupted by a staff member I had befriended in the building. She asked if I had caught the cat, and I said no ‚Äî but that turned out to be a rhetorical question. The mother cat had taken the bait and was trapped in the mere minutes I had gone for lunch!

&amp;#x200B;

[Cuddle puddle](https://preview.redd.it/luiacqr53oq41.jpg?width=1182&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23a5a18ac8df835d09e34c9c161170fd2d5aefee)

I worked quickly to grab the kittens and the mother cat (who was extremely upset... she thrashed and yowled in the cage, trying to escape) and I cried with joy. The kittens would now have a chance to be raised by a loving mother ‚Äî meaning they‚Äôd have stronger immune systems, stronger bones, and a greater chance at survival. I placed the mother cat and her babies in my closet which I use for housing my fosters and at first, it was chaos. She tore down every article of clothing from my closet hangers in her scramble to escape upwards and then got tangled in scarves before hiding in the litterbox. (When cats don't see a horizontal out, they go vertical, that's why many get chased up trees and get stuck.) But after about 24 hours the mother cat calmed down and began to nurse, groom, and snuggle her babies. I was overcome with happiness.

This was a huge accomplishment for me. First that I was able to trap an elusive community cat. She has been able to sneak into traps and avoid the trip plate before in order to eat the delicious bait, but her kittens were too big a prize to give up! Thank God for maternal instincts. Second that I rescued a whole family. Oftentimes humans are inclined to pick up the babies but not the mom. If you care about kittens, you must care about their mother too! For the first few weeks of kittens‚Äô lives, they get colostrum (an immune-boosting hormone) from their mothers. While bottle babies (kittens raised on formula alone) can still survive, they often have trouble. These kittens were able to be raised indoors away from the rain and predators, and mom gets to be comfortable for once in her life as she raises her youngsters. This will be her last litter!

[Mugshots](https://preview.redd.it/is2yje912oq41.png?width=820&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5995f0e151abb90151cc67a32a959d55aa413af)

As for names, we have...   
Clementine (F, orange tabby)  
Fig (M, tuxedo)  
Mango (F, orange and white)   
Peach (F, dilute calico)  
Tang (M, orange and white)  
&amp; Mama Cat is now named Emerson, short for Cherry-Emerson. 

For those who want an update: everyone is doing very well. Even the runt of the litter (Tang ‚Äî in his photo you can see he is a little underdeveloped in comparison to his siblings) is gaining weight every day and all five have finally learned to escape the den and explore. They're quite a rambunctious crew, and most of them are NEAR domesticated but it will take a little longer before we get some snuggles out of them. It brings me so much joy to see them run and pounce on each other like real cats! When I first met them they were puny little furballs with no coordination and nubby ears. They have grown tremendously in the amount of time they‚Äôve been here. \[See glow up pics below!\]

&amp;#x200B;

[12 days difference](https://preview.redd.it/7p0uedlx2oq41.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62fcf70d611fac21747e45ff4667f51a81642079)

But there is still more to be done. With these babies growing up so quickly and their mother added to the equation, supplies are running low! Usually, I‚Äôd take the family for intake at the county shelter. There they‚Äôd get vetted and put into the system. As their foster, I would receive food and litter for them, but this was impossible. With COVID-19 striking the day after I got them in my care, I was unable to bring them to the county and therefore I have had to purchase resources all on my own. These guys have anywhere from 3-6 weeks left with me, and mother cat can‚Äôt be released until she‚Äôs been spayed. There‚Äôs really no telling how long this quarantine could last, and if they‚Äôre stuck with me for any longer I‚Äôm going to need some help. 

If you are in a place to give, I would appreciate some wet cat food from my Amazon wishlist or donations to help me get Emerson spayed and released ASAP! (I asked Facebook friends and received an ABUNDANCE of dry kibble and litter supplies, which I am INCREDIBLY grateful fo.) The quote for the spay that I got this morning was $400, which is the typical price for a pet spay ‚Äî TNR is usually around $60. I'm seeking out cheaper options, and if anyone has connections to or knowledge of low-cost or discounted vetting services, please let me know!!! All of my usual sources have closed until mid-May and keeping a feral cat in a closet (making her stressed out, claustrophobic) for another 4 weeks is not ideal. 

If you can‚Äôt help with supplies or financially, then sending an encouraging word or sending good vibes for this little family would be appreciated. Sometimes rescue is hard and knowing other people are watching and appreciating can be very helpful. I am sending you all love right now, and if you ever need more kitten pictures I GOT YOU! The nuggets and I very much appreciate you for reading their story and loving them. ‚ù§Ô∏è

posts,"How does everybody feel after the first week of online classes?. I'm interested in hearing your experience, because mine hasn't been very good. I guess it started about a week before spring break started. Just like every year before, I felt a drop in motivation. I tried my best to attend lectures and keep up with all the assignments, but I just wanted that week off to be with my family. Then I can refocus once school starts again and study for that last round of exams and finals. 

Obviously, things did not turn out like I expected. After this first week of online classes, I feel like I'm barely holding up. I have seen posts here about different types of students and how the transition to online can affect them. I consider myself a pretty ""standard"" student. I try to attend all lectures, come to office hours sometimes, and just spend the rest of the time in CULC doing hw. So I thought the transition would not affect me as much. 

But then I realized how much the school environment plays a role in my learning. Sitting in CULC among others really pushed me to get those assignments done. But now at home, even though there is little disruption, I can't find that motivation anymore. That makes it 2 weeks of school not performing to the usual standards I set for myself. And I feel like I'm slowly getting into a hole that I can't crawl out of. 

If anybody has experienced the same thing as I did, please tell me what you did to improve the situation. Otherwise, please share your experience about online classes in general. Anyway, writing all of these down makes me feel better. Thanks y'all for reading this long post.",positive,0.991,04/03/2020

So in order to better enforce social distancing between me and my roommate, I will be moved to the room across the corridor from the original room I got at the beginning of the semester. I would have to get a new room key tomorrow and move the majority of my belongings in less than 24 hours. 

I was shocked when this news came out because Mr. Housing Director claimed that I have been sent an email two days ago (presumably by the DoH) and said I was the only one who didn't check my email; in fact, I have actually never received said email, and now I have to scramble to move stuff during a midterm weekend. While I do not fault Mr. Housing Director at all for the arrangement, especially since we've had a cordial relationship, I am unsure of the potential liability issues once I move into a room that is originally lived in by another student who signed the contract up to May 1st and has the right to return to their room if they so desire. In addition, I'm disappointed by the total lack of communication from DoH. Again, I insist that Mr. Housing Director is doing his job competently to try to make sure I get the memo.

From the phone conversation, I infer that there might be other students on campus who will be similarly displaced, especially those who are living with roommates. I urge you to check your emails often and phone your housing directors/ DoH immediately to avoid getting into my situation. Stay safe!",positive,0.5777,04/03/2020

==========

Every single Georgia Tech administrative official should give this a look.

This was developed by several students who are concerned for those disproportionately affected by the lack of pass/fail. It's not just me, so don't shoot the messenger if you look through and disagree.

Tech is now *100% alone* among its peers in its lack of modifications to its grading policy. This document contains a table describing the policy modifications across the top 50 engineering universities, including links to each school's policies. Spoilers: 49 rows in green, one single row glaring in red.

Among universities with reputable engineering departments, **only at Georgia Tech** are significantly disadvantaged students being forced to either suck it up or withdraw. That is not who we are, and that is not how any comparable university is handling this. Whether we as individuals personally need help or not, everyone should be speaking up for our friends and classmates who do.

Please share this document with your friends, or your Piazza pages, or your professors, or your department chairs, or the Technique, or SGA, or the Georgia Tech social media pages, or Dr. Cabrera's twitter page... Whatever you're willing to do.

If you have any suggestions on how to give this more visibility, please comment.

Our president should put his foot down with the USG Board of Regents about this, or find an internal workaround involving Petitions to the Faculty, or join forces with the presidents of UGA and Georgia State to ask the governor to intervene on the matter... Or at least say *something* about this. When the needs of disadvantaged students at every single peer institution are being met, but those specifically at Georgia Tech cannot say the same, his silence is not acceptable.",negative,-0.311,04/05/2020

College RISK update!

Well dang, look at us go! We are up to 2nd place with 24 held territories, we are dominating! We've now spread into the midwest and are looking to continue to make moves. The game is also down to 11 schools left after starting with 130.

Gotta say the GT Reddit community might just be the best college Reddit community in the country. Hundreds of the Georgia Tech family are uniting around their school in this weird time to show how great we are! Making that one click a day to put in your move is pretty satisfying when you see you've conquered that territory the next day. Let's see where the empire expands to next....

Want to join the squad? Use the links at the top of the page to play!

*Note: If you sign up for the Marching Orders today after 130 PM EST you won't get an order until tomorrow, so for today just defend Hawaii!*

posts,"GT Operational Updates: Refunds(Dining/student fees), Parking, Virus testing, Masks. To the Georgia Tech community:

The disruption created by the COVID-19 global pandemic has required a lot of information to be communicated very quickly and has forced Georgia Tech to shift its academic and administrative operations in an unprecedented way. We recognize that this can create additional stress and confusion and we want to briefly address some ongoing matters.

###Rapid Testing
Earlier today, federal and state officials announced that a parking deck on the Georgia Tech campus would serve as the location for a new rapid COVID-19 testing site. For more information about the testing and this drive-through testing program, visit www.cvs.com/minuteclinic/covid-19-testing.

###Wearing Masks
New guidance released on April 3 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain ‚Äî grocery stores, pharmacies, and other areas of significant community-based transmission. The CDC is advising the use of cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials.

Surgical masks or N-95 respirators are not recommended as cloth face coverings. These are critical supplies that should continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and medical first responders.
 
Because social distancing is still a very important part of slowing the spread of the virus, staff and faculty reporting to campus should continue to maintain six feet of distance from others. All are encouraged to wear homemade face masks, if they are more comfortable doing so, while on campus.
 
###Parking and Transportation
#####Permit Renewals and Sales
Parking permit registration has been rescheduled for June 2020 to allow all customers a chance to renew or purchase their permits. The renewal period will begin June 1, with general permit sales offered starting June 19. There will be no cost increase for the coming year. Full details at c.gatech.edu/3bJJ3mA.

#####Parking Permit Enforcement
Until further notice, permits are not required to park on campus. Regular parking permit requirements will not be enforced, and patrons may park in any ungated (non-restricted) location on campus. Restricted or reserved spaces, ADA spaces, visitor locations, and no parking zones will be enforced. For security reasons, parking deck gates will remain down.

#####Suspension of Payroll Deduction
Payroll deduction for April parking permit related charges is suspended. Permits will remain active and may be used through Aug. 14. Future payroll deduction periods will be evaluated and communicated at a later date. Payroll deduction requests for citation payments will continue as planned.  
 
###Student Fee Refunds
Georgia Tech has been working with the University System of Georgia (USG) to develop a refund plan that would apply to mandatory and non-mandatory fees. Fees will be pro-rated, beginning on March 16, for the remainder of the spring semester. The Institute anticipates processing service fee refunds by April 8. Visit the [Bursar‚Äôs website](https://bursar.gatech.edu/pro-rated_refunds) for complete information, including refund amounts.

###Dining Services Refunds
Georgia Tech Dining Services has posted information regarding reimbursements for meal plans, which will be automatically refunded by the BuzzCard office. Full details on how reimbursements are calculated are available at:
buzzcard.gatech.edu/important-information-regarding-covid-19-board-plan-refunds.

Students remaining on campus are encouraged to walk in and pick up lunch and dinner to go at Ferst Place, or to use Dining‚Äôs meal delivery services. Contact support@buzzcard.gatech.edu for all meal plan administration questions.",positive,0.4985,04/06/2020

 And he was left with budgetary promises of Deal

 Sawing on a keyboard and playing it hot  
 And the devil jumped up on Big Al‚Äôs stump

And said, ""boy let me tell you what I guess you didn't know it but I'm a coder too  
 And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a JIRA-bet with you""

""Now you make pretty good programs, son but give the gov his due  
 I bet a girlfriend of gold against your HOPE I think I'm better than you""

 'Cause Carona‚Äôs broke loose in Georgia and the USG deals the cards

And if you win, you get this shiny robot made of gold  
 But if you lose, the gov gets your financial soul

Kemp started up digital learning and he said, ""I'll start this show""  
 And fire flew from his fingertips as he typed real slow

He dragged Stack-copied code across the keys and it made an evil hiss  
 The state legislature joined in and it looked something like this:

**If lettergrade=TRUE:**

**HOPE=0**

**Elif PASSFAIL==TRUE:**

**HOPE=1**

**Else:**

**HOPE=0**

 Collins does your team bite, no child no

\#code was a graphics project, very well done

The governor bowed his head 'cause he knew that he'd been beat  
 And he laid that scholarship on the ground at Varun‚Äôs feet

 I told you once, you party of cocaine Mitch, I'm the best that's ever been""

posts,"Being away makes me realize how much I miss GT. This school is just incredible, and looking back I took it for granted far too often last year. Classes are difficult, stress builds exponentially, and yet Georgia Tech is far and away my favorite place on the planet. I remember my first week on campus and realizing that for the first time in my entire life, I was completely surrounded by people my own age that inspired me to grow and learn. You guys are the most amazing, talented, driven group of people I have ever met. We are the one of the most unique schools on the planet - a hybrid of sorts. We have all the wonderful perks of a state school: rich culture and history, deep connections with our hometown and state, sports and fans, a large alumni pool of absolute badasses, etc. However, we also have the academics to rival any STEM school on the planet - and rival them we do. In every single endeavor we take, I feel like GT students attack problems with this level of ferocity I just haven't seen at any other school. Maybe it is because deep down, every one of us has something to prove to the world, maybe it is because our culture encourages this level of performance; I don't know: but I love it and I miss it.         

I know this might be a little bit of a rose-tinted view of GT, and sure there are things that objectively suck here. Dining is ass, dorms are ass, classwork is ass, USG is omega ass, CS majors straight up smell like ass... But overall, I think Georgia Tech is exceptional - mainly because of you guys, the people I am proud to call classmates.          

.          

This semester is unprecedented in our school's history. However, never forget that Georgia Tech is built on struggle. Every student who has ever graduated has faced trials just as intense. But we have to keep pushing onward, together.        

**""To say Georgia Tech is a hard school is an understatement. It will be harder than anything you have ever done in your life. And the worst part? No one will understand what you are going through. No one, that is, except for your fellow jackets. Keep them close, and aid them when you are able: especially those too proud or shy to ask for help.""** - an alum's words of advice after I decided to commit to GT.        

So that is what I ask of each of you: don't give up, not with one month left until finals. Help each other, study hard, and finish this semester strong. Reach out to professors, they understand first hand what you are going through. But don't give up.",positive,0.5048,04/07/2020

posts,"A (slightly pessimistic) potential reason for no P/F classes. **TL,DR: The HOPE/Zell Scholarship fund was created with certain projections in place that model how many students will gain, retain, and lose their funding per year. Giving all USG schools the pass/fail option would keep kids on the edge from dropping out for one more semester and help bubble students‚Äô GPAs, which in turn would cause the fund to be overdrawn and interfere with future cycles.**

The University System of Georgia is unique in two distinct manners: USG is not only the sole state governing body to not abandon letter grades during the coronavirus pandemic, but also the only system that ensures most/all of its schools‚Äô tuitions to be paid for through the GA lottery for high performing Georgian high schoolers.

With the list of signatures and phone calls from invested stakeholders across the state growing by the day, why would USG resist on what is allegedly a ‚Äúsimple decision‚Äù to make? Money, obviously, as it is the answer to most questions. But whose money is at stake?

While *MOST* Georgia Tech students currently receiving aid are likely not in the bracket on the edge of losing meaningful amounts of scholarship money, as someone with siblings at other universities in the state, I can assure you that the average of our student body is so far removed from the average Georgian student that it is difficult to fully encapsulate the distinction through text. Of these ‚Äúless than stellar students‚Äù at one of the numerous other USG institutions across the state, a significantly non-zero percentage of them were going to flunk out, drop out, or perform below the level necessary to maintain their scholarship this semester.

Giving all USG students a pass/fail option would be giving tens of thousands of students another go-around at college in the fall‚Äîmillions of dollars not projected to leave the fund that can‚Äôt be recaptured through the same tax mechanisms used to grow it. While assessing the difficulty of re-stabilizing the base amount is difficult without hard financials, it would not be surprising if USG officials determined that given the pandemic, it was easier to cut their ‚Äúlosses‚Äù (read: human capital) and keep the letter grades.

So who do you save here? Do you allowed the ‚Äúscheduled culling‚Äù to cut a little deeper than before? Or do you find another way to make millions of dollars for college appear in the middle of an unprecedented lockdown? Seems like USG made their call.",positive,0.8844,04/07/2020

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hello Governor Kemp,

My name is Virtual_Wombat, I am currently a graduate student at GA Tech. I would like to request that you make the University System of Georgia offer pass/fail grading for this semester in light of the COVID-19 situation. I am worried about how I will make it through this semester without such considerations. Because of COVID-19 I have already been removed from my apartment (""to prevent the spread of this disease"") and I am currently watching my grades slip due to my lost resources and decreased work efficiency in my current environment. I was given a total of 5 hours to move my life around and then ""resume classes as normal"" two days later. Very few professors will make circumstantial considerations of their own accord in this trying time, and nothing less than a change in policy by the USG will help at this point. They have refused to change their policy so far due to the logistical workload that would create, but such an excuse has not stopped other universities from changing their grading policy in this abnormal situation. GA Tech is currently the only top 50 school that is still using the letter grade system. I am not normally one to ask for such help. I try to be a hard working student and have earned a 3.4 GPA so far at Tech, but I believe this semester will severely impact my grades without you intervening with the USG on behalf of students across the world trying to earn their degrees in Georgia.

Thank you for your consideration,VW",positive,0.7875,04/07/2020

posts,"An Accurate Method to Determine If/When We Get Pass/Fail. In a comment responding to a previous post regarding P/F, u/straight-outta-dixie made an excellent point that the state of Georgia depends upon a certain number of people losing their scholarships every year for their budgeting. 

This is most likely the cause for the holdout. The only feasible way that this loss of scholarship money that is depended on each semester by the Georgia government to finance something like a pass/fail option is that enough students in public University System of Georgia using the government funded scholarships will lose them in other ways (ie: death to COVID-19) to offset costs. 

Although quite crazy, there really isn‚Äôt any other work around unless there is a huge change in fiscal behavior of Georgia‚Äôs government. However, this balancing would apply to a non-emergency annual state budget. Georgia‚Äôs government could see the increased loss of scholarships as an opportunity of liquidity they could use for emergency funding and leave us students in USG out to dry since scholarship money probably won‚Äôt be a priority for a state government trying to compensate for leave-the-beaches-open-as-my-daily-COVID-death-count-raises-from-10-to-119-in-one-day inept Brian Kemp tries to play catch up as coronavirus pounds the state and overwhelms the healthcare system. 

Shortly, it would take probably a near miracle to have a switch to Pass/Fail. However, there are other potential avenues to compensate for money lost due to potentially failed classes because of the new circumstances that would possibly be more productive.


1.) The violation of contract on Georgia Tech‚Äôs end of paying for a full-length, in-person semester being substituted for a substantial time (4 weeks out of 16) in an online setting. Given the fact that there is proof that GT‚Äôs online masters in CS costs significantly less than in person classes, you could try to argue for compensation proportional to taking online classes for a quarter of the semester, not to mention a week of missed classes.

2.) For OOS students like myself, being subject to the decisions regarding my tuition (no scholarships or financial aid) at a public university by elected officials which I cannot participate in the election process of, there is an argument to be made on the basis of ‚Äúno taxation without representation‚Äù. Since I pay full tuition, that theoretically compensates me for not being a Georgia resident and paying taxes there. I haven‚Äôt read through the tuition contract yet, but this could be a loophole since USG elected officials are making decisions, not GT. 


Anyways, on a different note, my two cents on Cabrera criticism. On one hand, Cabrera really is at the mercy of USG and probably really desires a Pass/Fail compromise as this shortcoming will be a huge taint on his record of trying to improve student (mental) health and probably will majorly alienate most GT students and create distrust from his future efforts in his tenure. On the other hand, if he truly cared about student mental health more than his paycheck, he‚Äôd fight and publicly defy USG and rally tremendous student support across the state. Sadly, this is unrealistic to expect from a man who has already had a shady financial record regarding Koch brother money in his time as George Mason University‚Äôs president. His actions speak as to who and what he prioritizes.

Finally, I know the need for pass/fail is caused by the major issue of financial strain caused by losing scholarships or job opportunities or enrollment due to GPA. Please always remember this situation every election and go out to vote for someone who advocated for you and will put an end to these issues. That is how you create change.

But, NEVER STOP FIGHTING. Your continued efforts of public exposure may bring us P/F. Thanks to all who have dedicated such time advocating for others and doing so.",positive,0.9797,04/08/2020

We need the pass/fail option more than anything right now. Reaching higher should not be an option, mercy and understanding should be the standard. From the international student couch surfing because your home country's borders are closed, to the poor in state student who has spotty internet service, to the well off student who is comfortably at home, we all need this, we all need to be seen as humans are affected by this pandemic.

Please be aware that your students are also human beings that don't simply exist just do schoolwork or exist to get good grades. We are human beings also being personally affected by this pandemic. Not every student has a stable, loving home environment, perfect health, or even decent internet service. We are scared as we watch people in our lives get sick and possibly die, or lost their jobs and can't afford food, or even have to continue to risk their lives as essential workers. Myself and many other students I personally know are in these positions.

We need to know that you don't care more for this class or our grades more than you care about the fact that we are also human beings. My grades are very important to me, but my health is even more important as everyone on earth stares this virus, and possibly death, in the face. Don't tell me to use schoolwork to distract myself from the state of the world. Don't assign harder tests because people may cheat. Don't give us more work because YOU are just sitting at home doing nothing and think we are all like you.

WE ARE STRUGGLING. WE ARE SCARED. I cannot speak for all the students, but I can tell you what I am concerned about, what I am stressed out about, what keeps me up at night unable to do anything but lay there and be sad.

I have concerns about my grades, as my work may dip in quality due to factors outside of my control. Home is not a good place for me to work. You constantly remind us how/what we would be doing if we were at school, but we are not that is affecting my ability to do quality work, from fear and mental health concerns regarding the pandemic, to just having internet issues and family issues being at home

I am concerned that should I get sick, professors will still expect high quality work because you all think that we are just sitting at home ""doing nothing"".

I have concerns about the world as a whole, for my country as whole, as the world changes right before my eyes and no one know what is going to happen.

I am stressed out about life right now, and school is doing nothing but stressing me out more, and it's taking a toll on my mental health.

I am not procrastinating, lazy, or ""doing nothing"". I'm just trying to survive.

posts,"Where is our advocacy?. I'd like to begin by saying it isn't only Tech's fault. From what I understand their hands are tied by USG. What I don't understand is the lack of advocation. Sure, schools like GSU have basically forgone classes and have had expections lowered. At Tech however, they really haven't. There needs to be more of a push to move to Pass/ Fail classes. We don't need to get all As like other school but there should be a system to help since so many people are feeling effects of the virus.

There are a handful of kids at Tech severely effected by Corona and for them I feel exceptionally sorry. Yet, let me tell you the more common story that comes from the kids willing to push through and except the unfortunate situation they find themselves in. My parents don't understand what it's like to be at college. They expect that I can just put my lecture on pause and help out around the house or that when lecture is over, I should be able to help. They don't understand the rigor or the time commitment of school they can easily become frustrated that I am not being an active member of the family. Meanwhile, both my parents are essential employees and I have to deal with the ever present fear of one of them bringing home the virus. I understand I'm young and would most likely be fine but it still scares me everyday.

What I feel is really missed is that at school, I feel alive. I have people around me pushing me to succeed and offer enjoyable breaks from the tough classes. I have people to talk me down in the form of friends and mental health services and at home I have a dog that eats my shoes and parents with whom I have to hide integral parts of my identity. So yes, GT may be one of the few USG schools upholding a professional standard but it comes down to tech deciding wether to advocated for this struggling minority in the system or deciding where to cut corners and help out the students. 

Getting rid of the third test and moving it's weight to the final is not helpful. It just means my final is 40% of my grade and determines if I pass. I love Tech and believe we all are some of the best of the best out there. It's time we were treated like it. Across majors, averages are going down and if administration is just going to sit back and ignore that then so be it. Although my puppy barking throughout all my exams is not the only reason I'm doing poorly, the instutue should really consider the distractions faced by students in a home environment and the mental stress of overbearing parental figures.",positive,0.9808,04/09/2020

posts,"Just needed to share. I could have posted this in r/offmychest but I really just want to post it in here with you guys right now if that's okay. It's kind of incoherent but...

I was talking to my dad, who is, like, one of my biggest cheerleaders and I love him so damn much. He thinks I should stay in a class I'm taking, but it's been killing me the whole semester. It would keep me from having wasted some of my HOPE hours, especially since I've dropped at least three courses within previous years, and two courses this semester, which I know is really bad. Sometimes I'm miraculously able to pass courses I was doing poorly in the entire semester, but I have a strong feeling that won't happen this time.

I struggle with a cocktail of suicidal ideation, perfectionism turned OCD, anxiety attacks, the occasional panic attack, and apathy. Yes, I'm in therapy and on medication and I'm only taking two courses (because I freaked out and, as mentioned earlier, dropped two toward the beginning of the semester), so I'm beating myself up for not being as functional as I ""should"" be with all of the help I'm getting. I even have academic accommodations and while only one of them has been helpful, I'm very grateful for it. There's only so much that can be done for one person.

I'm doing way better in my one other course. I feel like there's a lot of hope for me in that one and that therefore I can go all out with the energy I do have. I don't want my chances of doing decently in one course to go down because I'm trying to salvage the grade of another. It doesn't make sense in my head. 

Ugh.

It's like...I know I'm not that important but there's always this sense that I'm letting someone down.

I just don't know the difference between ""I'm struggling"" and ""I'm a bad student.""

I might drop and keep it a secret from my dad. Idk if I should say anything to my professor but I want to. I mean, not in too much detail of course. Just like an explanation that I've enjoyed the class and appreciate the changes that have been made to the syllabus (he was kind enough to make changes due to Corona) but that I've just been struggling all semester in general...And I usually feel detached from what's going on around me so that makes it hard to process things even in regular conversations

It's just kind of hard to be honest about mental illness. Opening up about something that is going on inside of you on a daily basis is way different from opening up about something that is caused by a specific event going on outside of you.

posts,"To anyone with a mental health issue, here's my extremely inspiring and epic story of someone who is extremely mentally ill.. Hello everyone, I hope all is well with you guys and this horrible quarantine and virus is bearable. Everyone has been having a tough time recently, and I just recently went through one of the craziest experiences of my life. 

Content warning: I am extremely narcissistic and have an overly inflated ego right now. The language used here will often be severely self serving. I know this and I want to be up front about it. With that said, I am quite aware of it and will try not to be a total asshole about it and be as self aware as possible. 

Recently I just went through one of the most severe manic episodes of my life and am still experiencing it right now. A manic episode is part of being bipolar. When manic, someone can become seriously overconfident, have a ridiculously inflated ego, feel as if they can do absolutely anything, be actually successful at it, be ridiculously hypersexual, exercise a fuckload, and many more symptoms beyond that. This sounds all well and good, but there is a dark side to mania. Someone who is manic easily can lose control of their entire life and make decisions that drastically fuck up their entire life. An example would be me like me running through the streets yelling to every hot dude or chick ""Damn you're hot as hell let's get it on right here right now!!!"" The point is, mania is serious. It can ruin your life and the lives of others. Some random statistic I saw said that people with bipolar are up to 60 times more likely to commit suicide in their lifetimes. 

Bipolar comes with the other side of the coin as well, *depression*. This seriously sucks. I've experienced many times in my life where I've been cripplingly depressed. I sleep all day, hate everything, don't get out of bed, order in food instead of walking out the door a tenth of a mile to get it, etc. This part sucks and is also dangerous. A bipolar person may very well kill themselves during these extended periods of depression. 

Now onto my life. It may be the mania talking, but I am by far the WEIRDEST person I've ever met in my life. I am a walking contradiction. I have every fetish tagged on nhentai. I get myself into crazy situations just ""for the lulz"". This has been my entire life. I'd love to go into detail about how crazy this seriously gets, but for now just take my word that I am the king of all weirdos in this world up there with Chris chandler. 

My life started off pretty normal and good. I was born to a loving Jewish family that had a fair bit of wealth. We had enough money to almost always never worry about money, but were never multimillionaires and I wasn't a spoiled brat who got whatever I wanted whenever I wanted. Life was nice. 

As I grew up, my personality manifested, and I noticed I was ""different"" from others. Social patterns were awkward. I would act seriously odd around people for fun because I just wanted a dopamine rush. I fucked around and got myself into trouble whenever I could and tried to get away with it as much as possible. 

The worst part comes next. When puberty hit me, the world became a super scary place. I was insanely hypersexual and had a masturbation and porn addiction that crippled me to no end. My libido was so insatiable I had to go to the bathroom during classes at school and jerk off just to not gauge my eyeballs out. I'd go around the neighborhood teen hangout spots and meet as many people as I could and seduce as many girls as possible. With my unique personality, better than average looks, and insane confidence, getting sexual contact was simultaneously ridiculously easy at times because people liked to be around me, and hard because yes I'm a literal lunatic that at times can be seriously creepy and weird. 

My relationship with my parents began to suffer immensely. I was just too damn rebellious to contain myself. I raided the liquor cabinet for the first time at 12 years old when I was home alone, and tried Marijuana with friends when I was 14. These were all personal decisions to spice up my own life, not peer pressure. My parents had an unbearable time controlling me since I was such a rebellious asshole at times. I am so so sorry for everything I've done to them and all the worry I've caused them. For the first time ever, we've been able to communicate on equal grounds and all be simultaneously happy to talk to each other. 

Well now it's time to get to where this relates to Georgia tech. I for the most part breezed through high school riding mania and fighting depression as much as I could. I got into programming at 11-12 years old and became a literal programming wizard by the time I graduated high school. I got a 35 on my ACT due to being on adderall and annihilating the test. I had every extra curricular and award in the book for math, programming, and robotics. With all of that, it was not too hard to get into gatech. 

With all this said, my life seems like a living contradiction. How can a literal serial crazy delinquent be this successful? The God I don't really believe in is the only one who knows. 

Coming to gatech was an interesting experience. I started off with a bang and had a very successful first year with  grades only landing one B. I was able to land a beautiful girlfriend and have other sexual contact before and after that. Near the end of the year, the first stretch of major debilitating depression would begin. 

By the next year, I was a sad sack and hated everything. I didn't care about going to class. I literally never went unless I absolutely had to for attendance or for an exam. I'd bullshit my homework to the point where I'd get an A and stop there. I barely left my room, showered, or anything. This year was when I would seriously get deep into drug addiction for the first time ever. 

All my time sophomore year up until March was mostly spent being a literal crackhead doing fuckloads of work and isolating myself to masturbate all day. When the drugs would wear off after anywhere from 1-5 days of no sleep, I'd feel ridiculously horrible, sleep, and wake up to want to get to them again. Regardless, I somehow powered through sophomore year and had very good grades. More B's than before, but that's seriously good for anyone at gatech. 

After my love affair with stimulants, I quit them and began my love affair with novel dissociatives. I would get seriously wonked out nearly every day and barely complete my work. Anyways, I still somehow managed to pull off a successful semester by the skin of my teeth. 

After sophomore year, I was blessed to have an internship at Facebook. At this internship, I was very successful and got a return offer. I also met my super awesome current boyfriend and have had an amazing life with him living through this stressful junior year. 

During this summer, I had my first major overdose ever. Due to a mixup with substances and reckless behavior, I took up to 20 times what a normal dose of a dissociative would be and landed myself in the hospital after a complete blackout that left me almost brain dead. This was my wake up call. I DID NOT WANT TO DIE. After that, I became much more conservative with drug use and was much more careful. 

Junior year has begun, and we're back to old habits. I began to use every day just to hold off my depression and feel decent enough to want to live. When my boyfriend moved over to Atlanta to be with me, things took a turn for the better. I was able to become not dependent on drugs to live my daily life and I didn't want to kill myself. He again has saved my life. 

Junior year has been hard. My classes are hard. Issues with my mental health have been hard. It's been even more hard with how covid-19 has kept us locked up inside all day. 

Starting this spring semester, my life became much brighter. I was finally working through my mental issues, not self medicating to stay alive, and began having extremely nice healthy relationships with my friends, family, and boyfriend. This is when things gradually started rolling into mania. 

My life since spring break has been absolutely fantastic for the most part. I've lost a little weight, felt more confident, haven't needed to sleep all day, and continued doing very well in school.

This very quickly slipped into actual mania. It started with ridiculous overconfidence and the ability to just *not sleep*and feel like I've taken a hit of Molly at a music festival. I am on top of the world. I've been horny nonstop. Been extremely social. Been powering through schoolwork like a boss. 

Things took a turn for the worse just recently. The mania became impossible to control and I was deep in denial. I was being communicative with everyone in my life, and they quickly noticed something was seriously wrong. My support network of multiple medical professionals, my parents, my boyfriend, and my friends have all stepped up to monitor me to make sure I don't go batshit crazy and land myself in jail, a mental hospital, or dead.

With all this out there, reality slowly settled in. Wow, I have bipolar, and the bad kind too. I had a horrifying panic attack and realized that this seriously explains EVERYTHING in my life. My boyfriend was able to console me and calm me down. I love him for that. 

I quickly started reaching out to my professors letting them know that something was extremely wrong and that I may not be able to complete my schoolwork. So far I've already received emails that people are on board and helping me get through this semester successfully regardless of what's happening with my mental health. It makes me ridiculously happy to know that people care. 

I never believed gatech cared about mental health, but this is undeniable proof that they do. To all of you struggling with mental health issues (and I know there's so many of you here) please reach out. Do everything you can to make that first step. Even if people don't come rushing right away to help you, keep trying. Depression is horrible and hurts anyone that has it so much. Please get the help that you need and try to get anyone who may advocate for you to help you. I'm living evidence that the world can be a good place if the stars align. 

Well, the manic blog entry is coming to an end. I hope you enjoyed my story, even though it's way too long to ever read this ridiculous text wall unless you're seriously not busy at all. Let's get through covid-19 and this semester together and get the world to a better place. 

I'd love to answer any questions people have if you have any. After a day or two on the gatech sub, I'll revise this and probably do an AMA. Also I'll keep this account open to document the ridiculously glorious chronicles of my life if anyone cares to hear them. 

If you're the kind of person who read this and thinks ""wow this person is a total narcissistic weirdo piece of shit you should fuck off nobody cares"", I totally get it. I AM narcissistic and self serving because of how manic I am right now. If you want to harass me in the comments or whatever to blow off some steam, I wouldn't really like that, but go ahead. 

To everyone in my life, this is a public apology. I hope I didn't seriously hurt anyone in the process of this crazy life. 

tl;dr I am ridiculously mentally ill, but things are working out for the better. Peace out kids. Get some sleep unlike me.

For example, I majored in economics, here is how I think a scene might go:

Professor Jones: I have a question about your methodology.

Presenter: That's five slides ahead. I am getting there.

Professor Jones (clearly ignoring the presenter): I was just wondering how you can use pooled data when the characteristics of the group changes over time  
Grad student Elijah (Extremely nervous and visibly sweating): How- how do you handle heteroskedasticity?

Presenter: There was none in the model.

Grad student Elijah (suddenly angry for whatever reason): I didn't ask whether there was heteroskedasticity in the model- I asked how you handled it.

Presenter: The normal way, I suppose.

Professor Smith: I am sorry. I am going to need to see the slide with the residuals.

Presenter (Jumps immediately to that slide): As you can see the residuals indicate homo-

Professor Jones: I am sorry, we are out of time for the presentation. Lets all give the presenter a round of applause. (No one claps, everyone leaves)

Cuts to Dr. Thomas in a camera interview : I actually really liked that presenter. I think we might hire him.

Cuts to presenter visibly crying in his car. Cuts to opening theme music. Title card: The GT Econ department

The plot of the episode then focuses on students prepping for an impossible microeconomics exam, the kind that seems to occur literally every single time the class is taught regardless of the teacher. One student runs a regression that predicts that most students will fail. There's a subplot involving an extremely arduous series of consulting interviews that get more and more bizarre. The students study together, and everyone is concerned about their grades. At the end of the episode it is revealed in an interview scene that the professor actually has only ever failed one student and actually mainly sees tests as a tool for himself to judge his own performance.

**Proactive and Necessary Outreach to Students**

* Despite the general success of the distance learning delivery, we are learning, from direct communication and data analysis, that students and families are under enormous stress and that some students are struggling. It‚Äôs critical that each of us recognize the extraordinary and trying times and respond with empathy, kindness and flexibility.
* As communicated earlier, we cannot operate the educational enterprise under the same rules and even expectations of the normal school year.
* Please do everything needed to support the academic and overall well-being of the students in your courses.
* Beyond the feedback measures and course surveys, we encourage you to pay close attention to students who might not be engaging in class discussions, chats, or assignments. Look for signs of distress. Identify these students and proactively reach out to them.¬†",positive,0.8442,04/10/2020

Hello quarantine-ers! As the world is stopped, the battle for control of the United States brews on between every college in the country. With only 11 teams remaining, we need you to help us to victory! All you need to play is a Reddit account, 30 seconds a day, and a heart of Georgia Tech Gold!

As our Old Gold Empire grows, the forces of Chaos (team in black below) are becoming difficult to stop. As of this morning the motherland, the land of the 404, has fallen. We need to take it back and force Chaos' armies out of Georgia completely. The game is simple - sign up, click a territory you want to attack or defend every day, watch your work pay off. [Sign up for marching orders](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8F5KfttZQBj8ccK0PlrjOGDZqUJb87fPxLm-YPdY4cIqmRA/viewform?fbzx=-5834518503355511020) to help us coordinate our attacks! If you sign up today after 1PM EST, just defend the homeland, Georgia Tech, and your orders will start coming in tomorrow.

With 19 held territories we are in 3rd place but are lagging behind on members. We have around 600 people from r/gatech playing but a couple other schools are getting close to 1,000 after some recruiting efforts.  So, please join us and let's win this thing! See the links at the top of this post to get started and learn the ropes, and ask any questions you may have below!

I applied for unemployment on the GDOL‚Äôs website (about 20 mins) and qualified for a direct deposit about a week later. I didn‚Äôt want to apply for the Student Emergency Fund because there are definitely people who need that more than I do. I didn‚Äôt have to provide a letter to the GDOL proving that I was fired or anything like that.

My direct deposit did not include the CARES $600 (I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to because that‚Äôs a ton of money for a part time worker, but I‚Äôve also heard that hasn‚Äôt actually gone into effect yet so maybe I‚Äôll get like $300 or something? IDK).

5. As soon as you got matched we'll introduce you, and create a video call for you and your match to hang out in üî•
6. After the call, give us some feedback on what you liked (e.g. we'd like to know if groups of 3+ could potentially work better than 1-on-1 matches) or report someone if they were being inappropriate so we can keep the community fun üöÄ

Since we know many  people have had their summer internships or study abroads canceled we thought we'd open up our application process to everyone in this subreddit. At the risk of getting ""hugged to death"" by reddit, I won't be posting our product here since we're not quite ready for that level of use, but if you'd like to hear more about the idea please message me. TL;DR it's service that revolves around Spotify and Apple Music we launched earlier this year and it's in late Alpha.

We are searching for 3 additional members. One CS, one to manage Public Relations, and potentially one UI/UX designer. We already have 3 CS majors, one business, and one designer on the team. All fromGT. If you would be interested in a potential summer internship still working in person here in Atlanta on a start up please DM me. I'd be glad to share more details privately. Some of the perks include getting to join an already accepted create-x team, having a job for the summer, and other monetary perks. You don't need to be a perfect major match for the role, but that will help your chances in being selected. Please feel free to hit me up and hopefully I can help save three of your summers. Thanks.

According to this post[usg](https://www.bing.com/amp/s/www.ajc.com/blog/get-schooled/student-leaders-colleges-implore-state-offer-pass-fail/P4ltgxX3PpcmOFn1L8PnOL/amp.html), 17 different student government associations went on a call with USG officials. 

Apparently USG claimed they won‚Äôt do it because of concerns over grad school applications and the effect on Hope and Zell. 

One of these issues could be solved with opt-in, the other with a little collaboration with the Georgia Finance Commission. I don‚Äôt know why these people think it‚Äôs okay to jeopardize thousands upon thousands of students‚Äô mental healths and overall stability during a literal pandemic, but their callous attitude is incredibly asinine and insensitive. 

Yeah, I get that professors are doing their best. But they only had 2 weeks to transition in-person classes to something that could function online. Half of them barely know how to edit a Word document. It‚Äôs ridiculous to claim that the same grading policies will work when literally everything else about the class has been changed so sloppily. 

Students are sharing computers with siblings and parents who also have to do all their work from home. Many don‚Äôt have access to a quiet study environment. Some are also dealing with family deaths or illness. 

And then, on top of that, you tell them they have to work hours upon hours a day to maintain their GPAs for scholarships?? When professors who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing are intensifying their classes EVEN MORE, because it‚Äôs easier to cheat??

posts,"Fee Changes due to Opening of New Campus Center. Cool so Seniors and Juniors get to not have a student center (basically) and PAY MORE MONEY FOR IT

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Fellow students,

In these  tumultuous times, we are seeing amazing efforts among students to  provide resources and support for one another. While we currently face  unprecedented challenges, we would like to take the time  to provide information about changes in campus services and student  fees in the future. As we are looking forward to the next academic year  and hopefully resume normal on-campus operations, we‚Äôd like to share  with you information about fee changes with regards  to the construction of the new Campus Center.

As previous  announcements have stated, the current Student Center will be closing on  May 31, 2020 for approximately two years. Phase 1 of the campus center  project is nearing completion and is scheduled  to open in June 2020. Some functions of the old building will be  covered by a partial opening of the new building, where pavilions and  exhibition hall will be converted for this transition phase. These  essential services include among others the Post Office,  some dining services (including Chick-Fil-A and Panda Express),  Burdell‚Äôs and event services. The new Campus Center, scheduled to open  in Fall 2022, combines the completed new building and renewed old  student center building and will be offering again the  full spectrum of existing services plus additional offers.

Throughout this  process, student representatives have advocated the need for expansion  and have been involved in the planning and decision process, starting  with SGA resolutions in 2009 and the creation  of the Student Center Expansion Committee in 2012. With the need for  student-related contributions to the funding of the expansion, a student  referendum in 2016 supported the implementation of a new fee to realize  this project. However, students supporting  this project have made it a priority to ensure that the fee is only  being placed on students who have the capability to access the new  infrastructure.

With the new  building moving into partial operations, the funding of the construction  through the established public-private partnership will come into  effect as ‚ÄòCampus Center Facility Fee‚Äô charged to all  students with an amount of $85 per semester. This fee, based on  decisions made by the administration and student leaders and approved by  the USG Board of Regents one and a half years ago, covers 50% of the  total project costs, while the remaining costs are  covered by the Institute and Auxiliary Services at 25% each.

The fee will be  charged over the next 30 years and will distribute the costs onto the  generations of Yellow Jackets that will enjoy the building during their  time on campus, starting with us. The funding  approach for the Campus Center follows that of the Campus Recreation  Center. Each student is charged a semesterly debt fee, similar to the  Recreation Fee charged for the CRC.

For additional  information about the transition process and the student center  functionalities, please read the letter of the Student Center Expansion  Committee below:

[https://sga.gatech.edu/scec-letter](https://sga.gatech.edu/scec-letter)

If you have any  further questions regarding this fee or the fee‚Äôs in general, please  feel free to contact the student members of the Mandatory Student Fee  Advisory Committee (MSFAC) under [ sga-msfac@lists.gatech.edu](mailto:sga-msfac@lists.gatech.edu).

EDIT:

A reminder that this is what we can access:

#### The Exhibition Hall (Phase I)

* 12,000 ft2 ballroom, divisible into five smaller spaces
* 11 meeting spaces with full conference and teleconference A/V capabilities
* Expanded pre-function space
* Convenience of housing Catering Services in the same building

The exhibition hall will be part  of Phase I of construction, which is expected to last from May 2019  until Summer 2020. During Phase II of construction (Summer 2020 - late  2022), this building will serve as temporary space for critical Student  Center functions like the food hall and Post Office.

#### The Pavilions¬†(Phase I)

* An expanded Paper &amp; Clay¬†
* New office space for Georgia Tech Health Initiatives
* The Center for Assessment, Referral, and Eduction (CARE)
* A standalone cafe with indoor and outdoor seating
* An outdoor fireplace lounge

The pavilions will be part of Phase I of construction, which is expected to last from May 2019 until Summer 2020. During Phase II of¬†construction (Summer 2020 - late 2022),¬†these  buildings will serve as temporary space for critical Student Center  functions like the Student Center and Student Engagement administrative  offices.¬†

She is absolutely one of the least understanding professors when it comes to the Coronavirus pandemic.

First, she assigns a timed exam to only be available for 1 hour at 9:30 AM PST. In the announcement of this exam, she **EXPLICITLY** states that everyone will be taking this exam at the exact same time and that ‚Äúif you are in California, then in your time the exam with be 6:30-7:30.‚Äù 

Second, when she clarified that the exam is closed book closed note, a student asked, ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt this negatively impact the students who follow this rule and now score lower than those who use their notes?‚Äù She responded that ‚Äúno, people won‚Äôt use their notes because it is a department policy.‚Äù Which is absolute bullshit because there was absolutely no enforcement of this and it only stood to harm students who didn‚Äôt use their notes.

Third, instead of accommodating the material to for the lost week, she decided to just cram two weeks of material into a single week and double our assigned homework for the following week. 
 
At this point I‚Äôm not even surprised, I‚Äôve given up on my grades for this semester, but it just sucks getting reminded over and over again that some teachers just don‚Äôt care about their students.

&gt;  
&gt;Earlier this month, student government presidents from across the University System of Georgia (USG) sent a [letter](https://sga.gatech.edu/sac-letter-pass-fail) advocating for reconsideration of optional pass/fail policy.  
&gt;  
&gt;This past Thursday, seven of us student government presidents had a meeting with USG Leadership to express once again how we feel that an opt-in policy is in the best interest of students for a myriad of reasons.  
&gt;  
&gt;At this time, I have no indication that this policy will change. I, along with other student leaders, feel disappointed. We will continue advocating for students and doing all we can to ensure student voices are heard in this conversation.

Abstract: Quantum computation has the potential to have tremendous computational speedups across a range of problems. Still however, there exist constraints on what kinds of problems will be able to be solved. In the near term, we are constrained on every developed quantum architecture by the number of two-qubit gates required to complete an algorithm. Even in the long term, we will be constrained by the number of phase rotations required, since these are computationally intensive in the fault tolerant regime. In this talk methods of optimizing algorithms against these types of overhead will be discussed. In particular we will discuss these problems applied to near term and long term implementations of chemistry problems being solved on quantum computers.",negative,-0.774,04/13/2020

The initial grading also said that the final will substitute the lowest midterm, effectively making the final constitute 50% of your grade if you had a bad midterm. 

Now, I did poorly on my first two midterms but I‚Äôve picked up the slack now. This seems unfair to me because I‚Äôve put in effort after the first half of the semester, and am bound to get a much lower grade (think around a fall of 10% with the new grading policies).

I'm a third year Industrial and Systems Engineering student concentrating in Data Analytics. Basically it has always been my plan to go to grad school at tech after my undergrad, but my grades seem to make it harder and harder to do that every semester. I have a 3.5 right now with a C in physics 2 (which doesn't matter) and then another one in stochastics which *does* matter. I was really positive about bringing my gpa up this semester, but I have an incredibly hard time staying motivated enough to put consistent effort throughout the semester. I just took an advanced optimization exam and realized that I really might get ANOTHER C and literally started hyperventilating. My gpa should be fine after this because I hope to overcome with my other classes, but I CAANNOT be getting a C in another major course. My question is twofold: should I withdraw from this class and then retake it and get an A (which would mean 1 W and 1 C in classes that matter)? And second, do I have ANY shot at getting into grad school at Tech?

Any and all advice is appreciated and, again, sorry if this is super stupid",positive,0.9745,04/15/2020

There is a little known provision of the USG Board of Regents bylaws that would potentially force them to discuss pass/fail grading. Several other schools in the system are working with the same template email. Here is an example email.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

President Cabrera,

I hope you are doing well.

I am current \_\_\_\_ year student majoring in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ at Georgia Tech. I am writing pursuant to Rule 8 of the USG Board of Regents to request that at the next Board of Regents meeting (May 12, 2020), that an agenda item be added to discuss Pass/fail grading for Covid- 19 at Georgia Institute of Technology.  I ask that you please submit all resolutions and petitions submitted to you by students (Add any other attachments here). The Board of Regents bylaws section 8  states: 

‚ÄúAll individuals or groups employed or enrolled in the University System shall submit all requests for items to be placed on the Board agenda to the president of the respective institution who shall, after carefully considering such requests, transmit them with his or her recommendations to the Chancellor.‚Äù 

After passing along my request to the Chancellor, Section 9 states: 

Individual or group representatives who desire to appear before the Board of Regents to discuss or initiate a subject within the Board‚Äôs jurisdiction shall submit their request to the Chancellor to be received at least fifteen days prior to the scheduled meeting of the Board. The Chancellor, in consultation with the Chair, may either place the requested item on the agenda or reject it, notifying the individual or group of the reasons for his or her decision. The Chancellor may refer any such request to the Chair for referral to a Committee of the Board.

Pursuant to this section, I would request that the Chancellor provide a reasoning for his decision if he refuses to place my request, submitted through President Cabrera, on to the Board of Regents agenda.

Georgia Tech will recognize its Spring 2020 graduates with an online celebration on Friday, May 1, and an in-person ceremony on campus later this year.

The uncertain evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to set a specific date for the in-person ceremony. The target time frame is the end of the summer semester. Should that not be possible, the end of fall semester will be considered for the in-person ceremony. There will be as much notice as possible given so you can make plans to attend at that time.

The virtual celebration will engage the entire community in congratulating graduates on their academic achievement. The event will begin at noon with a welcome from the president and deans and will continue throughout the day with student interviews, messages from faculty, staff, and alumni, and opportunities for sharing on social media. Updates to commencement.gatech.edu will offer ways to virtually celebrate and participate.

""All of us at Georgia Tech have a deep sense of admiration for our graduating class, among other reasons because we know very well how much it takes to get there. Our graduates deserve to be recognized for this momentous achievement, which means so much to them and to their families,‚Äù said President √Ångel Cabrera. ‚ÄúOur online celebration does not replace our Commencement exercises but will help mark the completion of a journey.

posts,"My embarrassing BlueJeans story. Well, this just happened today - or rather, I just found out about it today - and I figure some of you may get a chuckle out of it. I sure hope to.. eventually.

Since my first semester at Tech, I'd attend this psuedo-GT1000 hangout where myself and a few friends would get some coffee at the Culc, talk about our week, and generally toss around for an hour. We've since been using Bluejeans and have been trying to keep the fun going in liue of being face-to-face. Last week, for example, we decided we'd change our monikers for that meeting to our 'stripper names' as a joke. Now I'd actually played a similar game during a Tech Trek last year, so I just went with the name I made up back then: 'Grandmaster Shamrock', playing off my Northern Irish background. Fun times, good craic, we closed the session after the hour and everyone got on with their weekend plans. This was the 10th of April, seven days ago.

Fast forward to this morning: I was cooking some eggs while listening to my professor's lecture with my mic and camera off (the standard for his class). He was discussing the history of film for a moment before coming to a somewhat abrupt pause in his speech: 'I do have one question though,' he said, his voice relatively unassuming and my eyes still focused on the frying pan, 'which one of you is ""Grandmaster Shamrock?""'. I froze, almost dropping my wooden spoon onto the eggs. I couldn't believe the sound of my fake stripper name leaving my professor's mouth. ""Grandmaster Shamrock?"", He repeated. Turning on the mic after the awkward wake of silence, I remarked how I was terribly embarrassed, and, rather than explain the situation truthfully, told him my peculiar title was for an 'educational role-playing session' of a previous class. I thought it sounded good at the time - a class I had last semester had a historical role-playing exercise - but the more I recollect the more it seems like a most strange retort, especially to the other students in the class, all of whom were completely silent during my mad ramble. I'm sure everyone was racking their heads trying to think of the context that the denomination Grandmaster Shamrock would be used educationally. In hindsight, role-playing and stripper names don't mix that well as an excuse.

I'm in LMC, so save for one elective I have no courses with more than 30 people - relatively small classes. Being called out in one was bad enough, but I soon realized that meant I've been attending these more personable lectures for a week now, asking questions, responding to prompts, often on camera, all under the guise of Shamrock, and no one corrected me until Friday morning. If memory serves, there are at least three courses (excluding the aforementioned) when the Grandmaster has made an appearance instead of my identifiable name. Perhaps the worst part is I've had two 8AM lectures where I don't recall speaking, so I now have to email that professor to let her know I actually did attend class, albeit as my stripper alter-ego.

I hate to be dogmatic, but if there's a moral to this story: always, *always* check and change your name back if needs be - it does *not* reset after each meeting. Apparently.

Tldr: forgot to change my BlueJeans moniker back from my fake stripper name and was called out in class.",negative,-0.9042,04/18/2020

posts,"Should I go to GT over UIUC (in state) for CS? Honest Opinion Please, I‚Äôm really confused. I guess part of my confusion is that my parents are telling me that GT, as an overall school, has a ""bigger brand value"" (read: prestige lol) than UIUC. They show me stats that have GT students being recruited more heavily by FAANGs and Wall Street Firms; whereas, UIUC has less recruited people, even with 30,000 more alumni. Plus, since I know that I want to get into AI/ML (along with Health Informatics), GT has a whole separate school with lotsa research funding and great faciliities (School of Interactive Computing) dedicated to it; whereas, at UIUC, it all comes under the umbrella of Grainger. I know that UIUC is a good program but do you think I should go for the in-state tuition (id be at a diff of 8-10k per year) if I personally feel a better fit with GT (where I can recuperate the extra money with coops, while gaining experience)? While I‚Äôm aware of its social shortcomings, I‚Äôve really grown to love GT‚Äôs academic/nerdy environment and really see this as somewhere I could spend my next 4 years.

I‚Äôm not struggling socioeconomically, which is something I‚Äôm very grateful for and want to recognize that privilege right off the bat. I am struggling mentally. It‚Äôs been taking me an hour or longer to fall asleep every night, never had insomnia before but I guess I‚Äôve never experienced the stress of Tech finals without also having the exhaustion that helped me pass out each day without an hour + of lying awake and worrying. I‚Äôm also having trouble eating and eating enough, not for any good reason. It‚Äôs just boring, and I don‚Äôt have enough of an appetite to eat enough where I don‚Äôt wake up starving in the middle of the night because I wasn‚Äôt hungry enough to eat a normal dinner.

It‚Äôs really great that people‚Äôs exam averages are higher and I mean that 100% sincerely‚Äî it‚Äôs true for all of my classes. I just wish the open note policy adopted by my professors was helping me overachieve in that regard, but it‚Äôs only been helping me barely hold on. I feel like the high averages disguise my experience. I don‚Äôt know. I just feel really weak, in that I don‚Äôt even have any real hardships other than mental health and the usual GT hell to worry about, and it‚Äôs still taking me out. How could I even reach out to my professors about this‚Äî what accommodation do I want? I just want the semester to be over quicker.

I‚Äôm not entirely helpless, I know what to do, it just feels like I don‚Äôt have the time to fix things until finals are over, because I have so many deadlines piled up that I feel guilty even taking a break. And it‚Äôs just the normal Tech workload. I need to start exercising to help with the insomnia, I need to figure out some sort of plan for eating so that it‚Äôs and not a chore I can neglect, I need to figure out a way to count the days that isn‚Äôt what deadlines I have to hit in order to not fail my classes.

Is anyone else feeling this? It‚Äôs OK if i‚Äôm just shouting into the void. I‚Äôm realizing that the only thing that made GT bearable for me was that my friends were there, that we all lived and struggled and succeeded as a community. I don‚Äôt think I would be able to put myself through this in a completely-online semester‚Äî if Fall 2020 is online only, there‚Äôs no way I could keep my registered classes while also keeping my sanity.

I'm so depressed rn,  I know I can't mess this class up as a CS major, but I don't know how to crack these mcq's that aren't even testing our real knowledge of CS. Anyone else in the same boat? And how are you preparing for the final? I can't even make use of any sample questions because he publishes hardly any that represent the final exam format. I'm so disappointed in myself, I might just switch my major if I bomb my grade in the final as well. Professors need to understand this is a format that is impractical. I can't even go back and check my answers, and I felt like I was on the clock every time I was thinking about a question. It's like I have to decide whether it's gonna be a race against time, or I should give up on  second-guesing the question and move on, AND NEVER COME BACK TO IT, even when I have time left in the end.",negative,-0.7575,04/21/2020

If that is the case, will I receive my housing fees for that semester, along with all the fees that I would not be paying (such as transportation, the CDC, etc)?

Money is critical in this time as I'm out of my part-time job and my family has been affected by the job shortage. I'm worried that my deposit will be lost and I will have lost more money because of this virus and Tech.

There was no partial question and he designed the question so the open book would not help us at all, then why make it an open book test, to trick us???

I am a very low-income student from a family that's often volatile, dude even my WIFI sucks, it felt like this test, I had no chance to succeed. He's planning to the same in the final, why be so cruel and make the finals and tests harder during a pandemic.Shame on him.

I lost my job, and one of my family members might as well, daycare for my sister is closed, we had a family friend in NY die.

2) Is the male-female ratio that bad? I know that it is getting better each year, but what are your opinions? Is it still 70-30?

And I just got the report from OSI... he didn't have any evidence of cheating. The only argument he made was that I didn't show all of my work on a problem (skipping the algebra steps of an integral bc I did it in my head), so he assumed I must have used a calculator. There is no evidence of me using a calculator, and I didn't use a calculator, but I still got reported off of speculation.

I believe I will beat the OSI case, but these things take forever to resolve, and I'm worried that my professor will give me a 0 on the test and completely destroy my grade. 

I tried to email the professor and ask him what his plan was for my grade on the test because it would take a while for my case to be resolved. Instead of responding to my question, he insisted that I do not contact him about this incidenent.

So now I'm worried that I'm going to fail math. It's been a month since the test, but there still has been no progress on my case.  I feel like I got screwed by this professor.

I also have some questions about these apartment buildings - would anybody who has lived there be willing to answer a few questions over PM? I am scheduling virtual tours, but I'm not quite sure if I'll get the true story there (especially since I've read a ton of negative reviews about every building that I'm looking at online lol)

posts,"Got Screwed by On Campus Housing - Any females willing to swap rooms with me?. Reddit maybe is an odd place to post this but I know a lot of current undergrads are active on here so, worth a shot. 

I‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôd be willing to swap rooms with me for on campus housing so I can live with my preferred roommate next year (Fall 2020/Spring 2021). I won‚Äôt be assigned my room until sometime this summer and am currently unable to select her as a roommate in the system so she‚Äôs unable to pull me in. Anyone willing to help us out??? Would be beyond greatly appreciated. Or if anyone has any advice for the situation that would also be really helpful! I‚Äôm super stressed out right now with everything else going on, and this is just extra icing on the metaphorical anxiety cake. 




Background: I was supposed to attend GTL in the Fall but ended up withdrawing from GTL in March in light of the COVID-19 situation worldwide and concerns from my family. I was also told we are not guaranteed classes in ATL should GTL be canceled later on and going into my senior year I didn‚Äôt want to risk not getting into classes and delaying my graduation. I applied to GT Housing in March and was told it wasn‚Äôt too late to apply; that I‚Äôd be guaranteed housing on campus. Unfortunately, however, I was not given a time ticket and I‚Äôm unable to select my room. I‚Äôm going to randomly be assigned a spot on campus sometime in ‚ÄúMay-July‚Äù. Originally they said they‚Äôd work with me to help me get in an apartment with my current roommate from this year but today I was basically told I‚Äôm on my own and that they won‚Äôt help. (Shoutout to conflicting advice from GT housing yet again...)

My roommate I lived with this year wanted to live with me again next year but she is unable to pull me into any room she gets on campus. I‚Äôm going to have to swap with someone in the same apartment as her after I get assigned a room on campus. She‚Äôs a second year senior and we‚Äôre both one of each other‚Äôs only close friends on campus.",positive,0.9865,04/24/2020

posts,"Gatech (EE) vs UIUC (Math) for an Untraditional Student. Apologies, I realize ya'll must get a lot of these posts, but I'm in quite a nuanced situation and would love some advice as I've got 5 days to decide. Long story short, I got into GaTech for EE and UIUC for Math, having dropped out of high school 2 years early, and will have \~90 transferrable units coming into college. Essentially, I've been interested in mathematics for a while, and have completed a good amount of graduate courses and work in the field. My main goal above all is to continue to pursue this interest to the same capacity I have been. (for context's sake, I'm currently using my gap year to pursue a graduate-level research associate position at a national lab) Ultimately, I'd prefer to stay in Mathematics, but parents are very biased towards EE.

**Georgia Tech**

Pros

* No credit transfer cap, GPA does not transfer (it's not bad, so this is only a slight positive)
   * For Math, I have a good amount of major-reqs completed and from a rudimentary perspective may be able to graduate in less than 2 years
   * Pass/No Pass courses transfer for credit
* Contacted a couple professors, if I am to start on research out the gate, I've been told its conceivable I could finish my PhD studies 2-3 years after completing undergrad
   * Side Note: the professors and admin here have been nothing but helpful and responsive, I've already met with multiple and they seem to be quite willing to work with my situation. Turnaround time has been perhaps the best with any other uni I have dealt with.
* Lockheed Martin and Intel have nearby campuses; I believe Coda has some groups dealing with parallel computing for high-order numerical algorithms, though they are a bit more obscure
* MARTA, I like trains lol
* Weather is similar to what I am accustomed to
* Cheaper OOS tuition (though only slightly)
* Prestige-wise is better? I honestly don't know what I'm talking about though

Cons

* Counting research work I complete now towards a future graduate degree is still largely just through verbal discussion with professors, and possibly will not work out in the future
   * Side Note: Although, it was suggested I might be able to apply towards a combined BS+MS for CSE 1 semester in, though idk how that would work
* Admitted to EE, which I honestly don't really have a keen interest for. I realize I could switch, but especially as GaTech is a tech school, my research field (numerical methods) is largely split between both math and CS, which could be messy. Also, would the non-engineering departments be less polished/lower-ranked?
* The process to take graduate classes is a bit cumbersome from what I've heard? I would like to explore some classes in parallel computing, as it is perhaps most in line with my work rn.

**UIUC**

Pros

* No credit transfer cap, GPA does transfer (slight negative)
* Contacted a professor who is willing to work with me to consult the administration on counting work done during undergrad towards a grad degree, is entertaining the possibility of having me work in computational hydrodynamics (all in all, seems more serious and willing to help w/ admin issues)
* More prominent work and faculty in numerical mathematics and scientific computing, having a more established research center for this work
   * NCSA Supercomputing Facility at UIUC, interesting work in parallel computing/numerical methods; quite interesting work in their CSL and XPACC research centers also that is directly related to my current work
* UIUC is higher-ranked in Math (honestly inconsequential in my perspective)
* Easy process to gain permission to take advanced coursework

Cons

* No idea if P/NP classes can transfer (under the impression they don't at the moment), still need to clarify if there is a transfer credit cap
   * Side Note: Their administration has been a pain in the ass to deal with. I've been consistently following up on an inquiry from 3 weeks ago and I still have no response five days prior to the deadline.
* OOS Tuition is more expensive (though only slightly)
* I was admitted to Math, but their applied math program is essentially labeled scientific computing in CS, which I hadn't initially realized. Seeing as they are primarily known for CS, wanting to stay in mathematics I fear I might be blocked from taking the courses I want.
* allegedly in the middle of nowhere, and cold weather?

**Another Gap Year**

* Most of my work has been semester-long research projects, and I'm obviously seeking something that I may pursue on a more long-term basis. Going to college this year would essentially mean I have to leave that research associate position, and I can't help but feel a bit like it was a lost opportunity. Ultimately, I could stay there for the next year, and just not enroll in college, fulfilling my gen-eds at a local CC.

posts,"Switching from CS to Architecture. Yesterday, I spent eight hours and twelve minutes debugging a program. I went on walks, I meditated, ate, did everything I could to change my environment to figure out how what I did wrong. I eventually figured it out, but instead of feeling relief, I just felt like I had wasted my entire day and could have been studying for finals.

I am a second year CS major, but have yet to even take CS 1331, because I switched from physics so late. I am incredibly behind in coursework, and I do not enjoy it. I chose this major because I want a job and I want the prestige. Even if I manage to graduate, the last thing I want to do is sit at a desk and do this for a living, even if it is for Google.

I simply don't know if I can do this for three more years. I want to major in architecture; I want to create. I want to spend all day every day in the studio, designing something functional and beautiful, but I'm worried it is too late. I would love to take summer classes to jumpstart my architectural coursework, but many of the fundamental classes aren't offered in the summer, let alone online.

Who should I reach out about this? Do you have any advice?

Hey guys, I'm not the one who usually makes these, but I guess I'll take over for a little while. While we got ourselves to the top of the leaderboard a few days ago, we've been constantly targeted by our good friends fighting for chaos. They recently took down Clemson after a crappy re-roll due to technical issues, and now they're starting to do what they did around 10 days ago and spread like wildfire throughout our territories.

We still need everyone's support to bolster our numbers and regain these territories. Remember, after 50 days, the team with the most territories will win, meaning it comes down to whoever has the best strategy (which of course we seem to do pretty well at). Click the leftmost link to find your way to the game website and sign up for marching orders to get daily orders to attack/defend a territory. We need everyone's help to get our rightful first place position back! Go Jackets.

posts,"Georgia/ USG education. EDITTTTT: There are huge issues with the USG mindset I do not like them thnx

Edit #2: There's a lot of politics too!! YEs mention it! But this is just me and my friend having a frustrated rant.

I know we all have beef with USG, but my friend (who goes to another USG college) brought up a good point. For reference, we are both from Georgia, so this is a little bit about both the Georgia education system and USG.

She mentioned that much of the situation is caused by the mindset of achievement under stress, and how stress can cause the best achievement. Many essay contests in school (Oratorical anyone?) and many college essays look for essays about hardship and many times the sob stories (don't come for me I wrote mine about one of the worst moments of my life I'm trynna get that coin) were the fantastic ones. It seemed bland if you do amazing without facing a struggle, even though it's horrible to deal with some of the things students write essays about. Even in college, there's this idea that if you can get through your struggles you'll be a higher achiever. That success cannot come without struggle. That mindset has almost killed me .

In her words, ""they expect us to be martyrs for our universities"". During a pandemic, this translates to working through severe struggle and stress just to keep up. My mental and physical health is more important right now, but USG perceives it as I don't value success and achievement as much.

I think some of this stems from the Southern ideal of ""hard work"" and just always working through issues and working harder. From high school through college it seems always if I just get through it, if I just try harder, then I'll succeed. I don't know. I've never been to school outside of Georgia, so I don't know what translates to other regions, but this is just what I've noticed and what my friend pointed out to me. Sorry for the rant.

And the prof said that if he thinks I have plagarism he will tell the office of the student dean. Can I know how serious is this issue?",negative,-0.4969,04/29/2020

We officially back-stabbed Michigan 2 days ago, after coming to the conclusion that we needed to in order to have a chance to win. So we are now battling it out with them in the Southwest. Drama! Team Chaos continues to be an annoyance in the SE, but for now all of Florida is safety painted Tech Gold. Here's the map:

posts,"Graduate Student on Warning Status. Hi, I need to get some things off my chest and need some advice.

I started graduate studies last fall for Civil Engineering and ended up with a 2.5 GPA during that semester. Overall, I took two major classes, a seminar, and withdrew from another course mid-semester. As a result, I was placed on warning for this spring.

I've been going through a lot of personal issues for the whole year so far, so I've been struggling hard to focus on my studies. It looks like this spring I might have a non-satisfactory GPA as well. I took two courses, and worse case scenario I may end up with a B and a D. The course that I think I'll end up with a D is because I've fallen so far behind.

I never worked up the courage to talk to anyone like an advisor or the on-campus therapists because of my infinite doubts. The only people I reached out to were a few classmates and friends, and I thought I could rectify all of this on my own. I managed to make some progress, but overall it may not be enough.

Anyway, I've been researching that it is very possible for me to go straight to getting dismissed/dropped from GT, so I'm panicking since my finals have been over. I've talked to Danielle about my grades and she recommended that I petition for withdrawal from this one class I may do poorly in, but I've got no sort of documentation to back my struggle.

One more thing, I'm afraid that the leniency is almost non-existent when it comes to graduate school here. What I mean is that if I am dismissed, my chances of getting readmitted may be 0, but I'm not sure.

I'm sorry if you read this and felt annoyed or anything like that, but I feel trapped in a corner at the moment. If any of you could offer some advice, I'd much appreciate it.

Thanks",positive,0.1129,04/30/2020

posts,"Advice needed: The whole class got offered an opportunity to come forward about cheating on the test. Asking for a friend here. For real. This person's professor in the intro CS class assumed that the class cheated and sent out an email stating that they know that there was cheating going on. They offered students an opportunity to come forward and admit that they did. In that case, the students would get a 0 on that coding question (20%) but will keep the rest of the points. in case the students won't come forward and get caught, they would get a 0 on the whole test. I think the professor is being extremely generous and humane, and I told my friend to come forward (can still get a B+ in class). My friend wants to come forward too but is not sure whether the professor may add any additional punishment. Do you think it could happen?",positive,0.8072,04/30/2020

posts,"Cheating this semester should not be a surprise to the school. For context, I was not in school this semester but, after talking to all my friends and reading all of the posts on reddit about the shortcomings of online school, it shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise to anyone how rampant cheating would be during exams. 

All of the ivys have some form of pass/fail, be it mandatory or opt in; top tier non-ivy‚Äôs such as Stanford and Johns Hopkins have gone pass/fail; other top tier engineering programs such as Carnegie Mellon and Berkeley have gone pass/fail. 

Georgia Tech‚Äôs failure to adapt to the ongoing pandemic reflects a major flaw in the state of Georgia‚Äôs approach to combatting Covid-19. How can anyone expect students to be able to treat class normally when they have to combat things such as food shortages, increased mental health strain, and technology issues such as limited office hours and the general disconnect of virtual teaching. This is not Georgia Tech‚Äôs fault specifically, per se, but I think it‚Äôs disappointing how some people are sitting on a moral high horse and blaming the students when clearly they‚Äôre a result of their environment. Nobody asked for remote learning, but they had to adapt; the least USG could do was take off the pressure of destroying your GPA in the midst of a global health crisis. The state of Georgia has totally dropped the ball on almost every facet of this crisis.",negative,-0.9847,04/30/2020
