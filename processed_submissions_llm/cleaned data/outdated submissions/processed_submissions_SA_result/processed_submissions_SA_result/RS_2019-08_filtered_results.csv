I’m wondering because my academic advisor recommends I only take one of the two throughout my gatech career. 

I’m more interested in the topics covered in 2022, but I’m currently signed up for 2021 as i needed an elective to reach full-time credits this fall 2019.

posts,"Foreign language advice?. I'm not really sure if this is the type of thing people usually post on this subreddit, but I'm looking for advice on learning languages at GT since I'm starting here this fall.

I come from a mixed family. My parents and I speak Hokkien (Chinese) but a lot of my other family members speak Mandarin or Korean. I've made it a goal to learn at least a little bit of each of these languages at some point so I can talk to my relatives in the language they're most comfortable in. It would really mean a lot to me! 

That being said, I was wondering if I should consider taking classes in one of the two languages I want to learn. Or, maybe, there's a club/organization that might help? I worry that learning Mandarin will be really difficult since I'm pretty much a native English speaker. So, I'm a little scared to take an actual Chinese class at Tech. I'm not really sure how people feel about the Korean classes here.

posts,"Elite Aerospace Fellowship Program for Undergraduate Women now Accepting Applications!. Hey all! Just wanted to let you all know that the Brooke Owens Fellowship Program (BOFP) is now accepting applications for the class of 2020! The program matches undergraduate women and gender-minority students with paid internships at awesome aerospace companies like NASA, SpaceX, Blue Origin and Amazon Prime Air while also providing fellows with mentorship from industry executives. The program culminates with a networking summit in Washington DC to better inform fellows about all of the opportunities available to them in industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last year Tech had 3 Brooke Owens fellows:

Ashleigh Bunch: BSAE 2020, Amazon Prime Air ( [http://www.brookeowensfellowship.org/ashleigh-bunch](http://www.brookeowensfellowship.org/ashleigh-bunch) )

Rikhi Roy: BSAE 2020, Bryce Space and Technology ( [http://www.brookeowensfellowship.org/rikhi-roy](http://www.brookeowensfellowship.org/rikhi-roy) )

Saumya Sharma: BSAE 2021, Astranis ( [http://www.brookeowensfellowship.org/saumya-sharma](http://www.brookeowensfellowship.org/saumya-sharma) )

&amp;#x200B;

The application is quite extensive but if you or anyone you know meets the following requirements please send the application form their way! While all of our Brookies so far have been AE, the fellowship is major agnostic with the only requirement being an interest in pursuing a career in Aerospace. If you have any questions feel free to comment them and I can pass them onto our current and past Brookies!

&amp;#x200B;

Requirements:

* You are an undergraduate student as of today.
* You identify as a woman or as a member of another gender-minority group.
* You are available for full-time employment in the summer of 2020.
* You are interested in pursuing a career in aerospace (any aspect of the field).

I've always loved this area on campus, the fountain adds such a nice feature to the center of student activity. It not only provides a scenic spot but also some nice white noise while studying or eating outside. Not to mention the nice little mist you get if the wind is in your favor.

Now don't get me wrong, I like brick. Brick is cool. It's red, and that's cool (Although not as cool as white and gold), it's hard, it makes cool noises when you bike over it, and it's reasonably durable. But FOUNTAINS, man, water is just sooo much cooler than brick, don't ya think?

posts,"Thoughts on Student Section ""Blocking"" System and Other Football Game Aspects. Hiiii, I just wanted to hear what you all had to think about the blocking system and students tickets for football games and wanted to express some of my own opinions.

I think the block system creates division within the student body at games. I know many students who aren't apart of organizations who want to go to games, but they feel super weird sitting in swarm because it's away from everyone else but also because everyone around them is greek or in other organizations and is huddle into little packs. They do not get the opportunity to go stand in the front at games or feel apart of the school spirit. It's another way we prioritize the greek community (and honestly mostly fraternities) and create a less cohesive student body. Even I feel like those who are affiliated, including myself, don't want to block. I just want to sit (stand) with my friends (some of which who are greek and others who arent) wherever I want and not feel like I need to know fraternity dudes or be apart of one of the organizations that do block to be able to stand somewhere at games and feel included.

What if tickets were free for all sides of the stadium? What if it was first come first serve, you just go stand where you want to for games? Perhaps people wouldn't show up 40 minutes in. Would this elimination of division and excitement to get to the game create more of a sense of comradery? Would attendance go up? I know at other large universities, football tickets are free for everyone, and sometimes they have a sporting event point system in place where the more sporting events you go to the more likely you are to get a ticket to a football game or be in a specific section (in our case, North or South).

I know many of you all will just say, go sit in swarm, go sit on the south side, you dont have to block, or just pay attention to the game and to that I say, fair enough I suppose. I know football is often mainly an interest for those in greek life anyway, but I just feel like this is once again, another way that GT prioritizes the greek community, excludes other students, and makes game days ""who is who"" and less of ""We are Georgia Tech!"". We can talk about how student organizations are all the same people, or same greek people some other time (you may say they're the only ones who want to be involved but we know that't not true.) \*\*eye roll\*\*

posts,"who are you when nobody's watching. Another existential crisis post here from a fellow yellow jacket as school gets closer (I'm a 2nd yr ME major). There's a lot I want to say but I don't really know how to put every different thing into words so I just wanted to touch on a few things for now and hear your thoughts; it'll be a bit scattered as I type

(1) ""Who are you when nobody's watching?"": this is something I keep hearing/reading as I ""attempted"" to do self-reflection and put myself into a healthier mindset this summer. Who are you when you're off social media? Who are you when you're not stressing over grades because of family expectations or your own perceived expectations from friends that looked up to you as the ""smart"" person and fear of them losing that image of you? When did you find and where do you derive your passion?

I find myself not knowing what I like to do, both in terms of academic passion and non-academic hobbies and I know we all have to start somewhere but I feel like anything I pick up, I drop relatively quick because I don't see progression and there aren't enough checkpoints of growth that give that dopamine rush to push onwards. Most days, my mind just feels really cloudy and I can't find myself to do anything. The exception being when it comes to study for school, albeit I do procrastinate but then that fear kicks in--fear of failure--and my mind feels more active all of a sudden as I'm studying subjects where the material seems fascinating, but I don't find myself enjoying because my motive is fear. I realized that it was the same thing in high school and perhaps because of that, I never really found a passion---everything was fear-driven. I feel like I'm at that age where I should have at least 1 hobby that I'm ""good"" at and enjoy but I don't.

(2) I want to help people but the fear of being bad at it or negatively affecting the people I want to help stops me, both because I feel so inexperienced in everything but also so damn socially awkward/anxious and quiet.

(3) I'm a part of a program that I don't feel like I belong. I'm grateful for the opportunity but I can't help but feel imposter syndrome and often times, guilt. That they ""made a mistake"" when accepting me, that maybe I unintentionally lied on my applications/interviews and made myself appear as this figure that I don't feel like I am, that I may have deprived someone who actually is worthy. I thought, the guilt will make me want to work harder and prove my worth but that brings back to pt. 2 where I'm scared of hurting people I want to help/sounding stupid or misinformed that I found myself withdrawing more than ever. All these fears made me really detached from everyone there, fear of being ""exposed"" as an imposter.",negative,-0.9867,08/03/2019

posts,"Who's down to eat some lettuce?. There used to be a Georgia Tech Lettuce Club a few years ago, but it disbanded once the person who annually hosted it graduated, which he recounts in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/99sb0e/lettuce_club/e4qbe1v/).


As far as I know, there are no reincarnations of the club yet, so I'm looking to see if there's interest in starting it back up again. It'd be a casual affair with a meeting every year or semester.

**Proposal**

* Set a date in November for a first meeting on Tech Green

* Create promotional material weeks beforehand for the event, Facebook group, etc. etc.

* Does Georgia Tech give money to students for clubs and events? If so, look for funding to buy some lettuce and drinks. See if tables can be borrowed from somewhere.

* Then meet at the event, have fun, and repeat for a few more years if interest exists.

**What is lettuce club?**

If attempting to eat an entire head of lettuce within an hour intrigues you, then Lettuce Club may be the perfect match for you! The idea behind lettuce clubs is a for-fun event where people do it for the sake of it, whatever that reason may be. Hungry? Eat lettuce. Drunk? Eat lettuce. Stressed by finals? Eat lettuce. For a club with virtually no time or monetary commitments, the ratio of effort to fun is off the charts!

*If you're interested in attending or helping, please leave a comment or PM me. Thanks!*

**Edit:** Since this got 20 upvotes in the middle of the night, it seems that *lettuce eating* would be a fairly popular pastime in the GT community. I made a shiny new Facebook page so we can organize our lettuce eating... [fb.me/GTLettuceClub](http://fb.me/GTLettuceClub)

posts,"GT further hurts grad students with increases to student fees and mandatory health insurance costs. Georgia Tech has been steadily increasing student fees, originally created at $100/semester as a ""temporary measure"" in 2009 and have steadily risen to 10x that for the current fiscal year ($1,000/semester). Most graduate students are required to enroll full time spring, summer, and fall totaling student fees of ~$2700/yr. This is the fifth highest among all graduate schools in the country. That is ~9-18% of a grad student's income, depending on which department the grad students is in. Because these fees are not bundled into tuition waivers, they are still taxed for those fees even though they never actually see that money in their income. Additionally, the new student health insurance provider will increase our mandatory insurance costs by $1500/yr. On top of all of this, GT won't let other outside grants or funding cover student fees. Graduate students play a critical role in university systems. If you factor in cost of rent in Atlanta, food, utilities, and other mandatory expenses, it can become quite clear that the increase in student fees can be the make or break point for a grad student going into debt or not. Graduate students teach and grade courses, provide cheap research labor, and help to drive ingenuity (and therefore funding and prestige) for Georgia Tech. If GT doesn't do anything to fix this, by paying their grad students a competitive wage WITHOUT duplicitous fees, they will lose fantastic students to other universities. Cost is something every grad student looks at when comparing top tier grad schools. If they feel they'll go into (or further into) debt (after undergrad), they will choose to go elsewhere. This affects all of levels of GT: it affects GTA teaching quality, it affects institute research quality, and it affects grad student quality of life. And don't even get me started on how the on-campus, university-promoted, graduate student living center ISN'T EVEN AFFORDABLE ON GRAD STUDENT STIPENDS. I tried to avoid getting rant-y, but GT seems to genuinely be out of touch with their grad students and it's illegal for us to unionize, so I'll end here.",positive,0.8182,08/05/2019

With the lack of $$$, indie devs are forced to use creative approaches with minimalism whether it be in the emotional effort put into a games' story, unique takes on simple game mechanisms, and artwork that isn't the most graphic-intensive but still aesthetically pleasing. Sadly, many of these games don't reach large audiences and are crushed by larger companies.

English 1101

English 1102

Math 1551

Math 1552

Math 1554

Math 2551

Math 2552

Does GA Tech allow double majors? Would it be realistically possible for me to do them? I will have 84 hours left to do in AE (down from 132) and I will be able to subtract 41 hours from the CS major degree. Also, 7 hours of these two degrees that I will take overlap. The reason I want to double major is that since my primary degree is AE and I will only need 2.5 years to finish, and I want to have CS as a backup major because of the high salaries. I think I can get the CS degree in 1.5 years.",positive,0.4871,08/06/2019

posts,"Interested in a 3-credit course on happiness?. I'm a Tech alum (MS HCI '00) and I'm doing a post doc here now. I'm teaching this course in the fall. If you're interested in practical ways to be more satisfied and happy or if you're interested in philosophy and the social sciences, I think you'll find this course interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Topics - Happiness** 

(It may be listed as just Special Topics in some places)

BMED 2803 

* Section A (91423)  MWF 12:20 - 1:10, ES&amp;T 1125
* Section HP (honors only) (91480)  MWF 11:15 - 12:05, W Village Dining Commons 277

Open to **all majors**.

Some of the **practical** stuff in the course:

1. How to sustainably increase happiness
2. Cope with stress and disappointment
3. Make better predictions about future happiness
4. How people succeed or fail to find meaning in life
5. Work effectively with others
6. Appreciate cultural differences in the definition of a good life
7. Manage worry and self-deprecation

The more **theoretical** stuff in the course covers sociology, economics, and philosophy. It includes topics like the association between income and happiness, the impact of income inequality of Americans' happiness, changing definitions of happiness across history, and the difference between happiness and a good life.

Here are some **reviews** from previous students:

* ""This was one of the most rewarding classes in terms of personal growth and understanding I have taken at my time at Georgia Tech...This course was a major factor in the growth this semester.”
* “Dr. Martin was one of the most knowledgeable and passionate professors I’ve had!”
* ""Very useful - we learned about different theories and the history of happiness, but more importantly, I took away a lot of practical ways to improve my happiness.""

posts,"Is Earning An Associate's Degree Worth It/Are College Classes from a Tech. College Good?. Hey everyone! I am currently a sophomore in high school and I was wondering whether it would look impressive if I earned an associate's degree in high school from Georgia Military College (w/ credits from both GMC and online Central Georgia Technical College). To elaborate, I am already planning on having my electives be Comp. Sci, Graphic Design, and Spanish. Additionally, I would be taking AP Comp. Sci. A + Principles, AP Spanish Language, and AP English Language + Literature. I think these electives are well-suited to my desired degree (Computer Science), however I feel like having that extra ""it"" factor with the associate's degree could make me more appealing. On the other end, however, I would have to have to take ~4 classes each summer in order to earn it, and I don't even know if an associate's degree from GMC is THAT impressive. Plus, I have heard that many online credits, like lab sciences, history, mathematics, and psychology do not transfer over. What I'm trying to get at is I do not want to overload my summers with this work if it doesn't end up benefiting me in the end. Should I or shouldn't I take these classes to earn an associate's degree over my remaining summers, or should I just take only some Dual-Enrollment classes here or there over my remaining summers for credits I KNOW will transfer over and count towards my degree? Thank you all so much!! :)

posts,"Conditional Transfer Questions. I just found out that there was a transfer chart which shows that transfer applicants must meet some required courses in order to transfer. For a CS major, it says that you have to take two lab sciences sequence courses (so like physics) but I didnt find that out until now (as in, i didnt register for any physics class in the college that I’m currently in). 

1) If I don’t take the lab science sequence classes that have transferable credit, will I not be considered for the conditional transfer? In other words, are conditional transfers also required to go by this chart in order to transfer as a CS major? 
2) If I apply as another major, will it be difficult to switch majors to go into CS?

Edit: Question #3) I got a 3 on my AP Phys 2 exam (oof i know) and that is anyways a non transferable credit (it transfers as a Physics 1101 or something which the transfer equivalency website says is nontransferable and it doesnt seem to count as a GaTech level Physics 2 course). I’m guessing this already means that it doesnt count as being one of my lab sciences. Can someone confirm or clarify this?

CoE faculty, staff and students,
 
We are deeply disturbed by the discovery of written notes in two of our campus facilities in recent weeks that contained a racial slur targeted toward African Americans in our community. The offending language runs counter to our commitment to diversity and inclusion, and we condemn the use of it as it does not reflect who we are or who we strive to be. The Georgia Tech Police Department is investigating the incidents. Anyone found responsible for these deplorable actions will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law and Institute policy as the safety and security of our students, faculty and staff is priority one for the Institute. To the members of our community who were hurt by this racial insensitivity, we truly regret that these incidents occurred.

A couple of friends and I are coordinating a guild for the upcoming World of Warcraft classic release! We're mostly Georgia Tech Alumni (class of 2013-2014), and wanted to reach out to past and current students to see if anyone else wants to link up.

We are currently targeting the ~~Faerlina~~ ~~Herod~~ Stalagg server (US-East PvP) and will all be rolling Horde characters.

So far we have about 15 people of varying levels of commitment and interest who have decided to guild up together. We would be interested in bringing in more players if anyone is looking for people to WoW it up with.

We are ultimately looking to run raids, but you do not have to commit to raiding to play with us. We will likely be raiding about twice a week once people have begun to reach the level cap and have been appropriately geared.  People are welcome to level at their own pace. 

We are planning on naming the guild &lt;Buzz&gt;, but that is subject to change. There will be a Discord setup later this evening.

If anyone is interested, please just let me know and I'll PM you a link to our Google docs spreadsheet where we're tracking class choices and battletags.

THWg!

Edit: In light of the streamers announcing that they will be on Faerlina, we will be targeting Herod instead.

Our Discord is up and available: Join us at https://discord.gg/2fTXpjx

I don't want to complain and make someone feel like unwanted or that they're being kicked out of their room, though I also worry though that I'll feel a little isolated from the rest of my year.

I am currently an MS-HCI student at Gatech and I am working on a project to develop a free mobile app for hard of hearing (HoH) people. Our project goal is to create an alarm clock app that can help people to wake up more easily and conveniently. 

In order to make an app that can successfully address our users’ needs, I am hoping to interview some hard of hearing people in this group to better understand their day to day experiences of waking up and how they interact with existing technologies and alarm apps.

This video interview will take around 45-60 minutes to complete. All the data collected will only be used for research purpose and your identity will be kept anonymous (I will send you a consent form for more study and privacy information once you’re interested in participating). 

Because this is a social project and everyone involved in this project are volunteers, we are sorry that we won’t be able to compensate for your time. However, you will be a great contributor that helps us make an app that takes your needs into account!

If you're like me, you recently received an email of the itemized damages of your room after moveout. The Standard was obligated by law to give us this list no more than 3 days after moveout, for my case it has been 15 days. For this reason, we are obligated to our full deposits without any withholdings.

So I ask that you, if you had any of your security deposit withheld, respond to their itemized damage email with this template (or something similar if you'd like):

Hi, 


Georgia Law requires this itemized list be sent within 3 days of move out (pursuant to OCGA 44-7-33 section b). 


According to 44-7-35 section b: ""The failure of a landlord to provide each of the written statements within the time periods specified in Code Sections 44-7-33 and 44-7-34 shall work a forfeiture of all his rights to withhold any portion of the security deposit or to bring an action against the tenant for damages to the premises.""


For this reason, I request the entire deposit be returned to me. Otherwise, I will have to pursue payment in small claims court.


Have a good one,

YOUR NAME



UPDATE:

Just received an email this morning saying I will be receiving my entire deposit back. We did it boys. Fuck you The Standard.

But don't get complacent now. Now we wait and see if they pay out the deposits by August 31st. If not, they'll have a much more expensive legal threat looming.",negative,-0.8393,08/14/2019

I am sorry if it doesn’t belong. I just couldn’t find a thread or the transfer sub-reddit dedicated to the Georgia Tech info.

Here is a little background about myself:

I am currently a community college student in Out-Of-State, planning on applying for GT as a transfer student in the near future as an AE major, and I was hoping on getting some feedback.

I’ve been following the GT transfer equivalency table as well as the course requirements per major, and here are the list of courses and extracurriculars that I have done so far:

**Courses:**

&gt;English 1 - Completed \[A\], English 2 - Completed \[A\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Communication Studies - Completed \[**D -&gt; A**\]; &lt;&lt;**My main concern**: *I got ‘D’ originally due to family member’s health-related issue, hospitality. Then, re-took the course and got an A.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Intro Sociology - Completed \[**B**\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Intro Psychology - Completed \[A\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Pre-Calculus 1 - Completed \[**C**\]

&gt;  
&gt;Undergraduate Research in Chemistry - Completed \[A\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Engineering Physics 1, calc based - Completed \[A\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Engineering Graphics - Completed \[A\]

**Overall GPA** *^(including ALL Pre-XXX courses)***: 3.70**

posts,"Three tips for people going [back to] class this semester (with science). [tl;dr I made a video about three tips for college students to help them do better this semester](https://youtu.be/zctlqMz5bAc)

It's that time again. ~~Temperatures are falling~~ ... ~~the pollen has gone away~~ ... it's August. The Atlanta Falcons are losing preseason games and the fall semester is upon us. Whether you're dragging yourself back to campus or showing up fresh from FASET, you're gonna have some tough spots this semester. As someone who Got Out^(tm) last year, I thought I'd do some research on some helpful tips and share it with you.

**1)** Make a planner. Maintain the planner. Love the planner.

Either get a paper planner, use Google Calendar, or scratch it into your NAVE roommates door - I don't care, just set up a planner. First put in your class times (and locations, cause you'll forget), then any other things you have going on like work, clubs, and Sandstorm meditation. You should also schedule (yes, schedule) time for sleep - I'll come back to why in a second. Next, I'd suggest scheduling one or two weekly blocks of time where you go somewhere and do whatever work you need to do that week. Lastly, block off a little ""you time"", cause taking care of yourself is important too. You shouldn't strive for 100% productivity.

Why should you do this? A recent meta-analysis of 94 independent studies showed that people who made a plan of what/when/how they would take goal-directed actions were more likely to stick to those actions, avoid negative influences, and recognize goal-related opportunities [\[1\]](https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/10973/06GollwitzerSheeran_ImplementationIntentionsAndGoalAchievement.pdf?sequence=1).  If you choose not to use a planner, well, you'll find out the meaning of Hell Week/Month soon enough.

**2)** Start building good habits. Like right now.

You ever notice how you get to finals week and even though you actually kinda want to study so you can crack that B range, you just can't seem to pull yourself away from rewatching the Japanese dub of King of the Hill to do it? That's because you didn't build up the habit of regular studying throughout the semester, so your subconscious mind is resisting it and it feels uncomfortable.

You have something some call a ""subconscious homeostatic impulse"" - this isn't a widely accepted scientific term, but I'm trying to keep this short [\[2\]](https://medium.com/goalcontrol/your-subconscious-mind-determines-your-comfort-zone-heres-how-to-take-charge-of-both-710e66250830). Essentially, you have well-established neural pathways relating to your frequent behaviors and actions, which take less thought and energy. Your brain would really like you to keep taking those actions because the brain uses up a lot of energy overall and those actions have kept you alive so far. Lucky for us, this works both ways. You can make your brain prefer habits that help you, but you have to start a little earlier than November to really reap the benefits come finals.

**3)** Sleep. Please.

Look man, I've been reading Matthew Walker's Why We Sleep and it's basically scared me straight as far as sleep is concerned. Apparently, sleep deprivation is literally **the problem**. Jokes aside, not getting enough sleep causes a plethora of negative side effects on your body and mind. One of them directly related to Ma Tech is how it impacts our ability to learn - we can hold some info in our short term memory, but to really bake those goods in there, we need to store it in long term memory via memory consolidation.

An important factor of memory consolidation is sleep - specifically, stage 2 NREM sleep, which we get most of during the first half of the night [\[3\]](https://www.tuck.com/stages/). If you're staying up watching Shrek 3D until 4am every night, you're missing out on a lot of that stage 2 NREM sleep - even if you sleep late to compensate - and you'll have a reduced learning ability. This is one of the reasons why all-nighters are dumb and I hate them.

Anyway, that's all I have for now. Hope this helps someone. Follow these tips and the only nightmares you'll be having will be watching our football team trying to figure out how passing the ball works.",positive,0.9624,08/16/2019

posts,"Prospective CS Transfer for Fall 2020 - Tips. Hey everyone. I just started freshman year at Indiana University at Bloomington. I was initially admitted for Finance but after thinking hard about life after college, I have settled on Computer Science. I really want to transfer to GaTech's CS program after my freshman year here. Below is an outline of my classes and I would appreciate some tips and honest feedback about transferring into GaTech's CS program.

&amp;#x200B;

I have credits for English Composition 1 and Calculus 1 from high school.

&amp;#x200B;

Semester 1:

Calculus 2

Physics 1

Intro to Com Science

Intro to Micro Econs

&amp;#x200B;

Semester 2:

Calculus 3

Physics 2

Eng Comp 2

Intro to Software Systems

Either: Intro to CS discrete math OR  Intro to Macro Econs

&amp;#x200B;

These classes meet the transfer requirements on GaTech's transfer table. I plan to submit my application during the Feb 2020 - June 2020 window and hopefully attend GaTech by Fall 2020. I would have a total of 42 credits by the end of Freshman year (June 2020).

&amp;#x200B;

Other than academics, I plan to join the Computer Science club here at IU and other CS-related activities.

She was saying that it looked like this would be the norm for every week. Another friend, who had gotten their cyber security masters said that they only had a few papers due per class each semester, but it was a pretty different program that was more about teaching and testing what was learned rather than going through the grind of assignments. Where you could take as many classes as you wanted each semester.

posts,"Am I the Asshole for eating in my first college class?. I had my first 8 am today, and like many others I'm sure, I didn't have a chance to eat breakfast before going. Most professors are fine with eating in class, but apparently not all. It was the first day and my professor threw me out of class!

 I needed my daily does of protein for an early semester buzz (get it? Buzz). I made sure to sit in the middle of the classroom to have access to an outlet. I plugged in my hotplate and poured my buttermilk pancake mix on the hotplate (low fat of course). The professor didn't notice this but the looks from my classmates around me were scathing! I was going to try and make friends by giving away any leftover pancakes, but not anymore! As I was flipping the pancakes I figures I would start frying some of my bacon; I kindly requested that the person sitting next to me unplug their laptop. They refused! Luckily, my back up hotplate had an extra long cord since I've run into similar scenairios in the past (the nerve of some people!).


As my bacon started to sizzle, (my pancakes were already  a crisp buttery brown in case you were wondering) the professor stopped his lecture, scrunched his eyebrows, and looked around the classroom. His eyes drifted for a bit and then narrowed on me! 


""What exactly are you doing?""


 I politely replied, ""Why, I'm cooking breakfast, the most important meal of the day after all!""


His face reddened and he actually stammered a little, 


""Wh- Wh- What the hell do you think you're doing? Get out of my classroom!"" 


I was shocked, incredulous, aghast! I tried to reason with the man,


""It's almost finished! If you like, I can offer you a strip or two of my bacon!""


He stood his ground, and began to physically shake, 


""I want you out of my classroom, NOW!""


I reasoned his demand was a charade, and he would change his mind once I gave him my culinary specialty.


Undeterred, I unplugged my pancake hotplate and plugged in my blender. The professor started to shout, but I drowned him out as I threw my pancakes, bacon, and milk into the blender for my daily protein shake. He sprinted up the aisle towards me and I could tell I may have misread his intentions (slightly)! I unplugged my other hotplate and blender and hurried out of the class, chased all the while by the professor. 


Anyways, I'm not the asshole right? The professor clearly overreacted. I would not recommend Professor Mohammed if you have to take him next semester.",negative,-0.8883,08/20/2019

posts,"Dual Enrollment Vs AP | Transfering out of highschool?. Hi, I tried calling admissions for a few days now but i always get redirected cuz their lines are too busy...

im a senior within the state of Georgia who will be Dual Enrolling at Gsu. .For background if it matters...

SAT:1230GPA: 4.00 | 4.27 (6 ap's)

I have a few extra curriculars, but the ones i do i excel at. I am also varsity in my sport.

Here are my questions

1. Does anyone know that if i get 30 duel enrollment credits by my graduation, can i apply to transfer into Georgia Tech? Can i include Ap's to these credits (lets say i take 12 credits per sem through de can i use my ap's to make it total to 30+ credits?) If so, will i get in as a freshman or sophmore?
2. This semester i am scheduled to take Gov ,English 1011 at Gsu and AP Calc AB/BC and AP Physics C at my school. I took an accuplacer allowing me to take Calc 1 at gsu. If i do this, i would need to drop AP physics C. I have reasonably good teachers at my school and I've heard GSU does too. If i pursue with this, I would likely take an elective along side Calc, making my GSU semester 1 schedule look like - Gov, English 1011, Calc 1 and whatever elective. What are your opinions on this change? How will it look towards admissions? Is it too heavy of a schedule to do sports etc?
3. Full time DE students who ended up at tech,  what was your experience like? How was your social life not taking classes at your highschool? Did you enjoy it? What was your outcome?
4. I've heard tech be very difficult from friends who are a lot betters students then I am. Im only human and im not a genius by any means. So I've been considering on staying at gsu till i complete 60 credits then transfering to ease the load. Anyone have any thoughts or experiences?

also, has anyone gotten in tech with a lower than avg SAT like mine? I'm completely understanding if i get denied and wont be heartbroken.",positive,0.9894,08/20/2019

I do have very high aspirations, and I want to excel, but I know I still have plenty of time.

 A part of this conflict is that I went to the VIP fair today. Talking to one of the faculty there, I realized this program is not at all for first-semester freshmen, and that while I'm technically a sophomore by credit, I should be taking major-related classes before getting involved. Additionally, I don't want to get into one of these classes, have no clue what I'm doing, and suffer, just because I feel pressured to do it from within.

If anyone has advice about the VIP program or how to deal with this anxiety in general, please help me. I want to enjoy my first semester, but I also don't want to waste it. Is there anything you tell yourself or anything you do to deal with this?

I graduate in May, with a BSME. I don't care for ME but I spent way too long in another major and ME is the only way to not become a seventh-year undergrad. Biggest fears are not getting a job or doing something like stress analysis, testing lubricants, HVAC, etc. The only courses in ME I've liked were system dynamics and ME2110. GPA is a 3.0 flat. I have work experience but it is all unrelated.

I need only five more courses to graduate, but I must be a full-time student because of other obligations. There are a few courses I've wanted to take such as ECE2026 and CS2110, but I'm afraid the 19 credit hour workload that would require is too much. (ME3057, ME4452, MATH 3670, CS2110, CS1332 as of now).

A masters degree is out of the question because I am broke/have a low GPA/am unsure about what to do.

How much does your major pigeonhole you? 

Should I just drop to 12 hours of ME courses for my last two semesters? 

Is it normal and/or expected to be so bored and disappointed with your area of study?

posts,"Some questions about the CS major from a high school senior. I'm applying to Gatech this year and I've been kind of torn on what major to apply to. I was looking through the Threads in the CS major and SysArch seems pretty interesting to me. I'm not too familiar with all the terminology and intricacies but I prefer the low-level software side of things like OS design, assembly language and stuff but I've also recently learned about CTFs and binary hacking (check out LiveOverflow on YouTube!) and that seems really interesting too. Which thread covers that?

The Intelligence thread sounds good too but I worry that that's more because of my childlike fascination with AI/ML than actual interest in the field. I heard about the Jill Watson TA thing that Prof. Goel created for the MOOC and ranted about it to anybody who'd listen for an entire week. Any Intelligence people care to weigh in on how you find the courses?

Then there's the Devices thread. I'm applying EECS/CSE to most other schools which have that option because while I'm more inclined towards the software side of things, I also don't want to be completely removed from the actual nitty-gritty of hardware. SysArchxDevices sounds like it would serve my interests but also I'd completely miss out of learning some AI/ML and security stuff.

Finally, I just wanted to know if the CSE major (Computational Science and Engineering) is the same as the CSE/EECS major offered by other schools. I don't want to do CompE because that's too much hardware for my taste and the general consensus on this sub is that getting CS classes as a non-CS major is a pain in the ass.

1. how much does portfolio factor into admissions? how do the AOs judge it for Industrial Design? I don’t think my portfolio qualifies as a “design” one, a lot of my pieces are conceptual, and some are technical ones that show artistic skills but virtually none with design/product aspects. should I add more design pieces specifically for Georgia Tech?

2. how easy is it to double major in something else along with ID, or switch out of the ID major? I’m just interested in a lot of other majors GT offers like Music Technology and I don’t want to be stuck in ID if I like something else better. I’m not going to try switching into crazy competitive majors like CS or Engineering (i have no interest in these fields) 

3. what are some differences between GT’s Industrial Design and other art schools’ Industrial Design majors? for example, RISD, Parsons, MICA, SCAD etc. all have the same/similar major as art schools. I’m debating on whether to just go to an art school for this major. 

4. this is a general question, but does GT accept college credits from an OOS community college? I’m taking Differential Equations right now in CC and I took Multivar and Linear Algebra this year as Dual Enrollment with a local public university. it’d be sweet if I could place out of the first 2 years of math as a freshman.

posts,"Gatech Screws over CompE majors, Pick CS instead. Gotta write another rage post regarding how hard Comp E majors get screwed over. (I went through 4 years undergrad and 1 year PhD so far.)

For context, the ECE department has a wide range of classes that mostly correspond with hardware, DSP, or Electrical Engineer specific classes like Power Management etc. Of the 11 different focuses offered, perhaps 2-3 of them apply at all to software based studies. As a Computer Engineer myself who uses the knowledge I learned about the fundamentals of computers to bolster my studies in Cyber Security, I require access to CS courses to dovetail with the hardware knowledge from the ECE courses I take.

I attempted to register for \~25 classes this semester, not because I could take that many but because that is how many classes I had to look up to find a single one that was both **available** to me and being offered this semester. Of the aforementioned 2-3 disciplines that CEs are likely to focus in, the ECE department may only offer \~5 per semester, and there's no guarantee that those classes will even relate to ones focus within ECE. To further aggravate the issue, the CS department blocks registration for all of its classes from ECE majors until the last few days of registration and further permanently blocks certain classes for all ECE majors (See Email correspondence below, if people require proof I can post screenshots with names blotted out). Note that I require a certain number of classes in order to fulfill my graduation requirements and the number required simply cannot be completed with ECE classes alone lest I diverge to study the number of watts it takes to run an electrical system rather than study anything that has to do with my focus.

“Under the terms of the law, any person who seeks medical assistance in good faith for someone experiencing an alcohol related overdose “shall not be arrested, charged or prosecuted” for a number of crimes related to underage alcohol:

•	⁠purchasing,

•	⁠attempting to purchase, or

•	⁠possessing alcohol,

•	⁠misrepresenting age to purchase alcohol,

•	⁠purchasing or acquiring alcohol on behalf of a minor,

•	⁠and misrepresenting identity or

•	⁠using false identification to purchase alcohol.

Additionally, any such person “shall not be subject to” penalties for a violation of a protective order or restraining order, or sanctions for violation of a condition of pretrial release, probation, or parole. This immunity applies where such penalties or violations are “related to” the seeking of medical assistance. All of these immunities apply to the person who seeks medical assistance as well as the victim.”

I take that way from West to East campus often and broke my ankle riding my bike there yesterday due to dust and debris causing my tires to skid and slide.

 GT Off-Road is a student competition team at Georgia Tech that participates in the Baja SAE design competition. Each year, our team designs and builds a single seat off road vehicle that is capable of tackling mud pits, rock climbs, river crossings, and myriad of other obstacles. Innovations in suspension, chassis, and drivetrain design lead us to victories and awards at our three annual national competitions. 

GT Off-Road is currently seeking new members to join our team. If you want to experience hands on engineering from design, to fabrication, to application (that means racing), then GT Off-Road is for you. It takes countless hours and unparalleled dedication to maintain a competitive team, and we need every hand to accomplish our goals. Give us a chance to show you how a professional racing team in a rigorous competition scenario brings innovative ideas to the dirt.

I feel the same way about CS 1331, but we're still in the part that is covered by AP CS A though so I know most of it. The professor said that we're responsible for knowing what is in the book, so reading it makes sense if not all the material is covered in the lecture.

posts,"ANTICO PIZZA: your local sexist pizza place. For the past two months I have been working at **Antico Pizza** in Atlanta GA.

I realized this would be a difficult place to work in when I was told women weren't allowed to make the pizza or cook. ""Traditional"" they called it. After curiously venturing to the pizzeria station when the owner wasn't there to oppress everyone, I was warned a woman was previously fired by the owner for doing such and he said if he saw a woman in the kitchen again she would be fired on the spot.

The manager recently became interested in me. He asked about a pride tattoo behind my ear, and I responded by explaining I'm not attracted to people based on gender, or bi/pansexual. ""That means you like threesomes?"" he asked. Uneasy, I dodged the question. He prodded, asking about my past sexual experiences. Then he asked if I wanted to have a threesome with him and his wife. He told me he wished his wife was interested in girls like I am. He began hugging me everyday I came into work and standing uncomfortably close to me whenever I rested from screaming numbers and running pizza, then started referring to me as his girlfriend. I recently got my hair cut and he wanted to touch it and told me I looked older (I'm 20, he's probably \~60). He told a coworker how ""beautiful"" I am and they told me to ""watch out"" because it seemed as if the manager was interested in me. I disclosed the situation.

I'm a GaTech student. I no longer work there. I care more about my mental health and safety than a dehumanizing side hustle. I've contacted EEOC, but wanted to warn people looking to apply or people considering giving their money to the place. There's better, less expensive pizza in the area. Go to Amazza or Varuni Napoli. Go to Rocky Mountain. Go to Pizza Hut and save. But if your set on ""traditional italian pizza"", keep in mind that at Antico traditional = sexual discrimination and harassment, and as a consumer you support this behavior when you buy.

I'm a freshman that was considering rushing in the spring and this has definitely convinced me to not rush at this particular fraternity, but now I am wondering: what do people know about the fraternities at Georgia Tech? Which frats haze, which frats don't, which frats build good character and which ones lend towards toxic masculinity and assault? I understand if many of these topics are sensitive, but I haven't been on campus for that long but I want to know which particular fraternities to check out. I had previously heard that fraternities at Georgia Tech were generally more of just sociable people, but tonight has shown me this is not the case across the board. Which frats should I consider to find people that are sociable, of good character, and would not harm another being without due reason?",positive,0.956,08/24/2019

I have been running a server for a few friends, and I will open it up to more people. It runs on vanilla 1.14.4, but autoloads some server plugins, of which are listed here:

* Backpacks:Craft a key and a backpack to expand your inventory. [Recipes here](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/backpack-item). Gives some armor, but cant wear a chestplate at the same time. 
* Brewery: Make drinks and get drunk. Really complicated so [here](https://github.com/DieReicheErethons/Brewery/wiki/Usage).
* Complete Recipes: Can craft horse armor, saddles, ore blocks, clay (from dirt), leather from smelting rotten flesh, nametags, and magmacream. [See details](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/complete-recipes/images)
* CrisTreeCapitator: Use an axe on trees to get them, and nearby trees. Will auto plant the sapling. Sticks, apples, saplings and the logs all usually fall. Pretty simple. We have our tree farm with them all close so one axe hit gets the whole thing and then we walk and pick it all up.
* DeadChest: Die and your stuff goes into a chest that dissapears after 10 minutes instead of just on the ground everywhere. A little buggy, some stuff doesn't make it.
* Magic: You get a wand at the beginning with one spell. Use it to earn sp, which you can spend on more spells by right clicking on a enchanting table. There are also free brooms around.
* McMMO: Do things to earn levels which give you powers. Right click with a shovel or pickaxe. Sneak ten blocks before a big fall. and others. Level cap is 500.
* PlayerHeads: Cut off mobs or peoples heads and mount them on poles or walls or wear them its disgusting
* ServerSleep: Not all needs to be asleep for the day to pass
* VeinMiner: sneak mine to get all adjacent ores. Will go through your pick the same as if you mined it. Also I have it enabled for diorite/andesite/granite. 

Join from vanilla 1.14.4 and have server packs enabled instead of prompted or off. I did it this way, so people do not have to mess with modpacks and installing stuff.

The url to join is [mc.vgd.me](http://mc.vgd.me)

If i decide to update the mods, the descriptions of which will be at [vgd.me](https://vgd.me)

If you open [mc.vgd.me](http://mc.vgd.me) in a browser, it is a google maps like view of the minecraft world. Its supposed to update every three hours, otherwise it updates when I feel like it. 

The biggest plugins are magic, and McMMO. The main village is supposed to be wizard themed, with the wands everyone spawns with, but some people don't care for magic, and they went off in some direction and are pretending its vanilla. You can do the same. 

Don't grief, and don't try and crash the server. I have some auto backup stuff, and the server is smart enough to restart if it crashes, but I will find you and shit your pant. Non tech students are welcome.

posts,"Transfer to Computer engineering. Hi guys, I had posted for transferring ti Computational Media major, but now I also wonder to transfer to Computer engineering. 
I am an international student and currently I am attending at Georgia State Perimeter College. I want to be a software engineer and I am considering to transfer to computational media, computer engineering or mathematics major. I hope I can transfer to computer science, but it is too competitive, so I might not consider that major to transfer.

I heard if I take REPP pathway, then I will get more chance to transfer to Georgia Tech. But when I saw Georgia Tech's Computer Engineering degree requirements, REPP courses have some courses which does not include Georgia Tech's Computer engineering degree requirements. REPP courses includes ENGR 1603 (Intro to engineering), ENGR 1211 (Engineering Graphics &amp; Design), ENGR 1671 (Computing Fundamentals for Engineers) and those are not in the Georgia Tech's Computer engineering degree requirements. It seems if I use the REPP, I will get high possibility, but I will waste my time. Am I right guys? 

I will finish just normal transfer degree requirements in this fall semester. I will apply next summer term as a normal transfer student. My GPA might be 3.7 with 50 credit hours. I will write my resume that I can do Java, C, C++, HTML, I got an internship when I was in Korea, some leadership program and volunteer works.
How do you think my possibility and which major will give me much high possibility for me to transfer at summer term between Computational media and Computer engineering? 

Also, I wonder does Georgia Tech will ask or require me some proofs of my activity and internships which is written on my resume? 

Please share your experience and give me advices. It will help me.

Thank you",positive,0.9686,08/27/2019

posts,"Don't Jaywalk on Ferst Drive. I just saw 6 people jaywalk at the bend in Ferst Drive where the baseball stadium is across from Greek row. They walked right in front of cars, a bus, and a bicyclist and e-scooter going downhill; the e-scooter had to swerve and nearly hit the curb. It would have sent her flying into a tree or possibly skidding across the sidewalk. 

I understand that there's a very long gap between the pedestrian crosswalk at Ferst and Fowler and the crosswalk up by the Klaus deck, but there's not one there for good reasons:

1) Drivers coming up the hill CANNOT see you, and you can't necessarily see them either. Jaywalkers risk causing an accident if they attempt to cross when cars are coming up the hill.

2) Bicyclists and e-scooters can potentially be going too fast down the hill to stop in time if you walk out in front of them. This applies to cars to some extent, too.

Please don't risk causing an accident just to save a minute of walking time. If the bicyclists and e-scooters are following the rules of the road, so should we as pedestrians.",negative,-0.6486,08/27/2019

The Yellow Jacket Space Program (YJSP) is developing Georgia Tech's first liquid fueled rocket program, and we're completely student run. Every design, every piece of hardware, every line of code, and every test is created and run by us - the students. Come help us create a liquid fueled rocket to go to outer space.   

If you're interested in gaining hands-on experience developing rocket systems, come to our info session on **Thurs.** **September 5** in **Mason 5134** from **6-7 PM.**  There, we'll talk about all of our openings as well as what it's like to be part of the club.  This info session is open to all current students at GT.

We are looking for dedicated students of all majors and all academic levels to help us out on the following teams:

* Avionics: Help design, build, and test all of the electrical hardware and software systems in our rockets, from the engine controller to the flight computer.
* Flight Dynamics: Develop guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) algorithms to enable active-control flight of our rockets.
* Operations: Grow relationships with current and potential corporate sponsors.
* Propulsion: Use advanced machining techniques to build and test our student-designed liquid rocket engine capable of producing up to 3500 N of thrust.
* Structures: Design and build the physical rocket bodies capable of carrying our electronics and propulsion systems to space.

There is NO dress code - we're all students, and it's way too hot to take things formally. We're looking forward to meeting you!

The first four letters retained the supposed venerable history of the school, and ""son"" emphasized 3 core values of the students: Sitizenship, Onor, and Ntegrity.

Today, the Clemson students are still known throughout the world for their Sitizenship, Onor, and Ntegrity.

It's begins today and first home game is next Saturday. Especially this season as it is a beginning of a New Era! Coach Collins has brought unprecedented energy to the program and we have to rise to match it! We in the front row of the student section formally known as Swarm (now Yellow Jacket Club Gold) would like to invite all to join us. I emphasize ALL. This is judgement free environment; anybody can be a passionate fan. Unless you wear red, there may be some judgment then. Even if football isn't really your thing, this is a great way to meet some awesome people, blow off some steam on a weekend, get on TV all the time, and more. We encourage being as spirited as possible as in wearing a morphsuit or some other outfit (as long as mostly white and gold) but definitely not required. Creativity is encouraged. 
All you have to do to join is have season tickets in the north endzone, the Student Yellow Jacket Club - Gold Membership. Show up before the gates open on gameday and, boom, there you are with us. 
If you are interested, join our official GT Swarm Fanatics group! It exists primarily to organize and promote the most passionate of student Tech football fans! I Share with friends please as well. Y'all are the future of student fan support here, its never too early to take charge. Also, follow us on Twitter and Instagram as well. If you have any questions about student tickets, anything GT athletics related, or anything Civil Engineering related (I'm a 5th year CEE student), feel free to dm me or comment on this post! Good luck with classes and I hope to see many of y'all at the games!!

Many providers are already committed to carrying ACCN, including DIRECTV, Hulu, PlayStation Vue, YouTubeTV and Charter/Spectrum (for a full list of providers in your area, visit *getaccn.com*).

Originally i was planning on studying abroad this upcoming summer, but someone told me to do study abroad during a fall/spring semester so I could try to get an internship over this summer. I thought it would be fine if I just got an internship during the summer after my 3rd year, but that person told me that is risky.

I really want to do a study abroad and would prefer it in the summer because I wanted to stay in campus during fall/spring. I am also involved in research and would like to continue that on campus. I also feel like if I study abroad fall/spring I won’t be able to get as many credit hours as I would on campus.

So what are everyone’s thoughts in this? Would it be ok for me to study abroad summer 2020 and trying to get an internship the summer after that? Or is this just not a good idea",positive,0.9005,08/29/2019
