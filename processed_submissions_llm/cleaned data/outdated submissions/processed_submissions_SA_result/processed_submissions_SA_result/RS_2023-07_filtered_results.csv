posts,"How much can you realistically make with on campus jobs as a CS student?. I have a pretty bad situation, and I realized it very late (2 days ago). 

My parents moved out of state in June. We specifically went to clarify it with the office of financial aid, and my HOPE/Zell still holds even in this situation. I sadly forgot to ask them about the SAL loan, which was a key part of my offer. I'll clarify it with financial aid office, but according to GSFC rules, I am ineligible for it. 

This is an extra 8000K hole in my budget. We can't take a PLUS loan either. To top that all, my car broke down beyond repair a few months ago, so the only jobs I can take have to be in a biking distance from campus. 

Hence the question: how much can you realistically make as a CS senior with on-campus jobs? If I was to work enough to make 8K per year, how many hours per day would it take? Or maybe what would be an equivalent in credit hours to this added load? 

Thanks a lot.",positive,0.6868,07/01/2023

posts,"Attempting to transfer in— y’all have any tips?. I (20F) hate my current college (also in the Atlanta area) and want to transfer into GA Tech starting in the spring semester, into the new Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences major (I want to go into meteorology). I’ve already met with my advisor at my current school; most of the STEM classes I’ve taken up to this point are tech-approved (they are in the ARCHE/dual degree program with Tech, I just don’t want to do the enviro engineering major I planned on before). 

My STEM GPA is alright but brought down by my last two math classes, Multivariable Calc Linear Algebra (C+ and C- respectively, the only Cs I’ve ever made in my life). Other than that I’m a B-avg stem student. It’s too late to do an ARCHE application for this upcoming fall semester, so do y’all have any other tips to help me transfer in? Who can I reach out to in order to help my chances? Is my current planned major very competitive? How much will my C math classes affect my chances?

Gonna be graduating soon, and I didn't have the courage to seek internships before getting out, mostly because I was terrified of failing at the job, or not remembering all the things I've learned here. But everyone says Tech students normally have job offers lined up by the time they leave, and that jobs are always seeking us.

I am nervous about obtaining and doing well as an employee once I get my degree, so I wanted to know if there really is an advantage to getting the GT curriculum over having a degree from somewhere else.

So, did GT overprepare or underprepare you for the job you eventually got?",positive,0.7176,07/01/2023

If anyone has any experience they're willing to share, I'd love to hear it! But what I really want to know is...

* Is there a mold problem? Some of the more recent Yelp reviews mention a glaring mold problem, and I do understand that mold can be attributed to how well someone takes care of their personal space but would like to hear anyone's experiences
* How noisy/loud is it? Are the walls just super thin or for the most part is it unnoticeable?
* I've heard that the gate between the Exchange and the SCC closes at midnight every night, is that true? ([here's a picture of said gate](https://imgur.com/a/iYZBhoS) but it is a little hard to see)",positive,0.9832,07/01/2023

For context, I just graduated from Tech with an EE degree. I was always more into the medical side of things and thought i would go into the medtech industry because i was interested in diagnostic electronics for home care access outside a doctor’s office (BP cuffs, pulse ox, ECG/EMG) but think I’m more interested in the actual patient care side while tinkering electronics as a hobby. I hated the Tech industry/office life. 

Basically, if i were to rescind my acceptance to my Master’s EE program and take a year or two off to study/work, what is the likelihood of being prepared for medical school? I’m not too worried about the self-study part and preparing for the MCAT but moreso the actual credentials and experience on paper needed to be a strong med school applicant. Do i need certain classes officially on a transcript (bio, orgo, anatomy—i self studied these for fun but never took the course)?

posts,"My employer hasn’t paid me within the legal time period, do I leverage my rights as an employee?. I am currently completing an internship in CA, which has very strict labor laws. Employers are required to pay you on pre-determined days and if they fail to do that, they owe the employees penalties for late wages. From my understanding, that penalty is a full day of pay (8 hours) for every day that the paycheck is late. My paycheck is currently 4 days late in counting. 

I already put in a ticket with HR/Payroll to inquire about the delay and have received no response yet. I also am not the only intern that hasn’t been paid [though some have been]. 

Personally I want to leverage my rights as an employee and ensure I receive the penalties I am legally owed as a result of getting my paycheck late (which I still don’t have). My mother thinks I should simply wait it out because leveraging my rights could make me look bad and she thinks they’ll fire me over it, which is also illegal because that’s retaliation.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m waiting for my check because I obviously need to be paid but am I wrong if I try to exercise my rights?",negative,-0.9187,07/10/2023

posts,"Academy of Medicine Parking Lot/PTS Rant. PTS is horrible but this post isn't really about that, that's more than been discussed already. Instead I have something to say about the academy of medicine parking lot- could we please get the smallest amount of enforcement there, by both PTS and GTPD? The vast majority of the people that park there don't have passes/aren't paying according to a GTPD officer I talked to, and I don't think that's fair to people who do pay the ridiculous 800/yr for just one zone from 8-5. In addition, it's in a significantly more dangerous location than campus, so if anything it should be even more overpoliced than campus is. Although there's definitely something to complain about with having too many PTS people and false tickets and stuff that occurs on campus, the other side of that (nobody checking at all) is worse IMO. GTPD told me that's what's going on (nobody checks this lot) after I found my car broken into a couple days ago before heading to work, which although annoying I can't say I found surprising given that a parking space was filled with broken glass for an entire month before they cleaned it up earlier today (they had a summer start-up event today that they zoned the lot off for, figure that's what got them to finally clean it). 

Obviously PTS gives no fucks about what people think (did anything ever happen as a result of that SGA investigation?), but hey maybe this will let students know that if they have a car with bulletproof windows they can park in that lot and not worry about getting ticketed.",negative,-0.9841,07/11/2023

I am finally getting out this fall, and I have been planning to get at least an ME master's degree from Tech before jumping into industry work for a few years now, but when I look back at my journey through undergrad, my chances don't look super hot. For reasons I can only assume to be related to neurodivergence, I sucked at standard lecture-style classes, particularly testing (project based learning was much more my style). Also, I only recently narrowed down what fields I am genuinely interested in, but I likely will only be able to spend one semester at most working in research for one of them. My GPA definitely isn't anywhere near the 3.3 that they want, let alone above 3.0 (not that low, but not what they want, either), plus I didn't do much in college to put myself out there besides some school of music stuff. It doesn't feel right for me to not apply at all (Spring 2024), though, and I would greatly prefer to remain at Tech rather than go anywhere out of state (or Atlanta, for that matter).

 Is there anything I could possibly do now to increase my chances of getting in on the first go even with a not so great GPA? And in the event that I do get rejected, what would be my next steps? Could I work in industry for a couple years, then apply again?

posts,"Bypassing Phase 2 Registration for Emergency Reason?. To give some context, I’m an undergraduate student accepted into the BSMS pathway, and currently my undergraduate degree is sponsored by a third-party scholarship organization, who will also provide sponsorship for my graduate degree, however, since this is a BSMS pathway, which in their perspective is just a 4+1 program, they’re requiring I double count my BSMS hours even though Georgia Tech does not, this is new to me. I countlessly tried to explain it to them but they’re aware and still insist on it. So my only way now is through Georgia Tech.

The issue is I only got accepted past Phase 1, and was never able to get my permits till now. Since I’m about to graduate this Fall, I only have a limited number of classes that will still allow me to double count my credits, and they have limited seats, but as of now there are still available seats.

So I’ve contacted the registrar, and went to the dean’s office to explain my situation and try to get a spot, but they aren’t helping me at all unfortunately. I’m also an international student, so if I can’t get those  classes then 1) I’m simply going to have to not pursue master’s since I can’t pay for it, 2) and also have the bigger risk of scholarships not being funded for the program anymore even if I want to try next year or via the normal pathway. 3) Much less I have to get accepted first into the program again.

I’m basically asking for alternative routes to fix this problem, and if there is a way to take this “up the chain”, cause I don’t know where to go. I have all the permits approved for the classes if it helps, but if phase 2 comes around and I don’t get those classes I’m basically just ruined.

Hey students in Georgia,

I came across some exciting news that I think you might be interested in - the Georgia Youth Sustainability Conference (GYSC) is happening in October 2023, and it's going to be awesome!

🌟 What is GYSC? GYSC is a sustainability summit organized by Green Cell, a grassroots environmental non-profit, for middle and high schoolers across Georgia. It's all about empowering the youth to take climate action in their schools and communities. The conference is being held in partnership with The Wild Center from New York, which has a stellar track record of organizing 150 Youth Climate Summits in 9 countries and 23 states since 2009. Now it's Georgia's turn to shine!

🎯 Desired Impact: This conference has some incredible goals for 2023:

1. Creating a safe, youth-led space for students to share intersectional climate stories.
2. Providing a platform to inspire education and collaboration, leading to developing localized sustainability action plans for schools and communities.
3. Increasing accessibility to climate education and collective impact by building a community around sustainability for middle and high school students.

💡 What's in Store for You? There's a lot to look forward to at GYSC 2023, including:

* Inspiring keynote speakers (both adult and youth) to motivate students to take action.
* A climate action workshop by The Wild Center, where students can learn and develop their climate action plans.
* Presentations from people who have already made a difference in sustainability in their communities - entrepreneurs, eco-club presidents, teachers, climate activists, and youth sustainability champions.
* Booths from partner organizations offering internships, volunteer activities, and networking opportunities.
* A poster presentation competition for middle or high school eco clubs, groups, or individuals. The best poster will be voted for by conference attendees and the judge’s choice.
* Art Installations, including ""The Great Wall of Trash,"" sourced from recycling centers, to create awareness and impact.

🌿 Be a Part of the Change! This conference is all about the youth and their power to bring about positive change. Whether you're a student, teacher, parent, or just someone who cares about the environment, it's a great opportunity to support the next generation's efforts to make a difference. They are also offering sponsorship opportunities for organizations that want to promote accessible climate education and action in schools!

🙌 How to Get Involved:

* Mark your calendars for October 2023 (exact date and location to be announced soon).
* Spread the word to all the middle and high schoolers you know!
* If you know someone who might be interested in the Green Cell Youth Program, encourage them to join for more sustainability initiatives and fun.
* Help find sponsors who align with the mission and vision of GYSC.

For more information and updates, visit the official website: [**https://youthsustainability.org/**](https://youthsustainability.org/)

Students interested can register here: [https://youthsustainability.org/register/](https://youthsustainability.org/register/)

Let's come together, learn, and support the youth as they take action for a greener and more sustainable Georgia!",positive,0.998,07/24/2023

posts,"IT'S ALMOST THAT TIME OF YEAR!!!!. Alright.
I thought I was only gonna say this once but I'm gonna say it again...

I hear the talking heads expecting us to do nothing this year.

I hear the pundits claiming that we will be locked in the basement of the ACC this year.

I hear the bettors overlooking us as some sort of pushover in the midst of a coaching and philosophy change this year.

I'm well aware of the fact that we are in the midst of an extended down strerch and Coach Key and company have a lot of work to do.  And despite that, I have one thing to say.

# FUCK!!  THAT!!  NOISE!!!!!!!!!
 And you wanna know why?

# Because THIS.  IS.  GEORGIA TECH!!!  

If we want to win the ACC in the first full year of Coach Key, then by golly are we gonna push for it!  We're at Georgia Tech; we can do that!

We can hang with the big boys!  We aren't afraid to go up with the best of them!  And if there's one thing this team, these players, and these fans know how to do, it's to NEVER GIVE IN!!
Every time I see one of these stupid posts on social media about a 4-8 expected record for the season, my blood boils.  We are capable of more than mediocrity or bottom feeding regardless of the strength of our schedule or the perceived lack of talent on this roster.  Because we have mettle.  We have grit.  We don't buckle under pressure or fold when the heat is on us.

So take this season one game at a time, and take each game one possession at a time.  You never know; a few stops and successful scoring drives could be enough to score a win any given day.  And we have a chance to win every game we play this year.  Nothing is ever a foregone conclusion, and no lead is too large.  We could surprise more than a few people this year and do some big things!!

""Stand in the face of the challenger, and don't retreat.
Empower these men (on the football field) to do what they came here to do,
And you gonna sing in the end.

## WE GONNA FIGHT
## TILL WE CAN'T FIGHT NO MORE
## GONNA LIE DOWN AND BLEED AWHILE
## THEN WE GONNA GET UP AND FIGHT SOME MORE!!!""

posts,"What's up with the OIE (Office of international education)?. Is it just me or have they decided to just not reply to any emails that they get on the main contact email? They also sent crucial visa documentation over a month late and very nearly made it impossible for me to attend.  I ultimately had to ask a friend of mine going to a completely different university to email their international office and then I got an actual answer for my situation (the situation is a bit long winded, has to do with late arrival due to late I-20 issuance by the OIE meaning I didn't get a visa interview until after classes start), because the OIE just straight up was ignoring my emails. I did go to the OIE drop in meeting on zoom with an advisor, but they didn't really help out, or explain if I was all good legally with my problem, or what additional documentation I'd have to take (props to the Columbia international office for ultimately telling me this stuff). 

This struck me the wrong way especially because it literally was the OIE at fault. Has anyone else had these sorts of issues with the OIE or was I just unlucky? I don't mean to be rude or unrealistic because I understand that the OIE is ultimately dealing with a very large body of students, however with something that is as serious as US visas and the legal right to be present in the United States, I'm worried.

I'm particularly worried because visa problems, work authorization, legal requirements expected of us that non US citizens may not be aware of (like filing taxes even if we have no income) and a bunch of other miscellaneous issues with being a non citizen studying in the US can be very complicated, and if not handled/advised properly, end in very serious consequences like ending up deported. It's important to have competent advisors to guide on these issues, and international students pay a seperate fee to ensure that. I'm curious (and hopeful) to find out if this was just a one time unfortunate problem for me or if the OIE is genuinely like this all the time, and how seniors get around it.",negative,-0.9314,07/28/2023

posts,"VIP + Reserch or JD Reserch Option? Misspellings to get AutoMod to not nonsensically delete my post again.. I'm about to start my third year, and  I'm thinking about my junior design options for my CS degree (I know, I  should've dealt with this earlier).

I got in the Automated Algorithm Design VIP back in phase 1, but I haven't yet planned out the research option at all. I've identified a few professors, but haven't really gone very far with that (I am still yet to email them 😭 for reasons). I also don't have any existing Georgia Tech professors I've worked under because I've been doing all my research at CMU thus far.

I plan on getting a PhD after graduation, and I know I need to (and really want to) do more research. I already have a few publications and want to get more out, especially ones in my specific area of interest (publications have been good but in applied work, I'm more interested in theory).

Arguments for VIP + Research:

1. No fallthrough credits - I have two credit hours worth of electives left, VIP will perfectly fill those in. Research Option will have a couple of fallthroughs.
2. Research flexibility: no need to commit to the Research Option plan, can start over with different prof if needed, can go back to CMU research as well, can abandon research altogether if one day I decide I like money and want to go to industry.
3. VIP is much less intense than the Research Option, meaning I can treat it like just another class (hopefully?) and take my actual research more seriously.
4. Haven't thought the Research Option through at all; might be way too late.
5. Tight four-semester schedule, I only have four semesters left. Messing up isn't an option.

Arguments for Research Option:

1. I already dedicate half my academic time to research, the Research Option will actually contribute to my degree instead of just being a parallel thing as it has been all this time.
2. VIP + other research may be more intense than just the Research Option?

I think the main thing this depends on is how big of a time investment the Automated Algorithm Design VIP is - I haven't yet been able to get a concrete answer for that. If it's really intense and takes many hours out of every week, then that's just eating at my research time.

posts,"GT Planning Worksheet for Google Sheets - Free :). Hey guys! Me again. I made a Planning Worksheet geared towards Tech students in Google Sheets! This is very similar to Degreeworks, but it's more flexible in that you don't have to create a new plan every time. It's also a little simpler to use.

Features include a custom formula to calculate your GPA based on grade and credit hour inputs, a resources page with FAQ, and examples of how to use the sheet. One of my favorite features is that you can tailor the sheet to how many semesters you're taking, how many classes you're taking, and you can test out what you think you'll make (in terms of a grade) in each class to see what your theoretical GPA would be!

Just take the link below and make a copy for your own use!

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10rBkpQE6BLYHF98EO5NsDECHcfwD\_QN\_ku3kP1dTYE4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10rBkpQE6BLYHF98EO5NsDECHcfwD_QN_ku3kP1dTYE4/edit?usp=sharing)

Technically, anyone (not just a GT student) could use this template. However, the grades that the formula uses are only A/B/C/D/F, not A+/A/A-/B+ etc. Just keep that in mind :)
