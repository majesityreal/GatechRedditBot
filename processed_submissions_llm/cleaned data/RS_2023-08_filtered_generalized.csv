post,"GTA/GRA Position Urgent - Need Help Finding Position. I am a current BS/MS CS Student and I just graduated with my bachelor's in Spring 2023, and am moving onto my Master's in Fall 2023. 
For context, I have completed 12 credits of MSCS work during bachelor's and only have 18 credits of MSCS work left.

I was just told a couple days ago by the hiring professor of the class that I wanted to GTA for that I might not be able to GTA for that class, because they might prioritize and give the positions to International PHD students.

As such, since that position might fall through, he said to look for other options as well.

Thing is, school starts in roughly 2 weeks, and I was genuinely banking on TAing for this class because I took the class in Spring 2022 and Undergraduate TA'ed for it in Fall 2022 and Spring 2023. 
Essentially, I have 3 semesters of experience with this class and have 2 semesters of experience TA'ing for it. (This class I have experience with is a CS 4000-level class and is a GTA-able class).

I'm not sure what to do and how I can find a GRA/GTA position.

Regarding GTA, had I known that this position might fall through earlier, I could have applied to more classes via the GTA application. I still have applied to other classes that I've done well in to TA for via the GTA application, since it is still open, but I'm not sure if this will work because most TA positions for classes are getting filled up right now.

Regarding GTA, I don't have any research experience. I have applied to a GRA position through GTRI, but I'm not sure how to find other ones.

I really need a GTA/GRA position not only for the tuition waiver, but also so that I can attain full time status and live on campus for Fall 2023 - Spring 2024. If I don't get full time status, I won't be able to live on campus, and since I only have 18 credits left, that counts as 9 credits per semester.

Any help and advice would be appreciated, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get a GTA/GRA position.",Neutral,Difficulty finding a GTA/GRA position.,2,2023-08-01,"employment, graduate studies, teaching, research, opportunities, challenges, prioritization, timing, experience, application, availability, tuition, status, accommodation, support"

post,"Incredibly frustrating situation with GT Housing- need advice. My roommate, who I’ve been living with for the last two years now, was chosen to be an RA for the upcoming school year. All good, because we knew that an RA can have one roommate come with them into their apartment. Unfortunately, housing told my roommate the incorrect room they were supposed to be in, and when they finally figured out the correct room, 3 of the 4 rooms had already been taken. We reached out to housing and they told us that one of the people in the rooms had to room swap with us. Which is fine, mildly frustrating, but acceptable. 

So we found the roommates and one of them was willing to swap with us, as they were going to cancel their housing contract anyways. So we initiate the room swap and I accept, and then they cancel their housing contract. 

Unbeknownst to us, even after I had accepted the contract, housing cancelled the room swap and it did not take affect, which we can only assume is because the person I was swapping with canceled their contract. And housing told us that they were unable to honor my request. 

So I am unable to room with my desired roommate, since room swap is now over, and they filled the room with someone else. So now I’m stuck in an apartment with three people I don’t know, and my roommate is also stuck in a whole hall to RA in, with nobody they know. Additionally, I did not receive ANY email that the room swap was cancelled, so I didn’t even know it didn’t go through until I reached out to housing themselves and they told me they couldn’t honor the swap. 

I’m at a loss at what to do. This entire situation has been maddening to say the least, considering since February I’ve been doing everything correctly to stay with my roommate, and housing is seemingly not owning up to their initial mistake of misplacing my roommate and I, and we keep trying to find the solutions, and am not making any progress. Everything that housing has asked us to do, we’ve done, and we’re still getting screwed over for it.

post,"Can’t decide if I want to pursue medical school or not. I am going to be graduating soon and I still cannot decide if medical school is something I want to pursue. In a lot of ways, I feel like this is something my family expects me to do and I feel pressured into it. My aunt is in medicine and every conversation we have she somehow finds a way to bring up medicine and asks about my MCAT studying and whether or not I have volunteer and clinical experience yet…it’s overwhelming.

Truth be told, I stopped studying for my MCAT 2 semesters ago because it was too much and I wanted to focus on my current degree so I can graduate with less stress. I only have volunteer experience through a class I took because I don’t have time outside of that to volunteer since I’m working my way through school to pay for my education since I have no help from my family. I do have research experience but it’s more technical than clinical.

It’s become increasingly frustrating because every conversation I have, I feel more and more inadequate and I’m at the point where I wonder if medicine is even worth pursuing because it just seems like there’s so much to do and once I do all the things to appease my advisors and family expectations the amount of money I’ll have to shell to take exams and apply is even more anxiety inducing.

I just don’t know if I should continue trying to get experience in the ways that I can via classes and do a gap year or two (I was told that I can’t gauge whether medicine is for me or not unless I’m really in the environment working with patients) to possibly get a certification and work in the environment or if I should just go into my industry. I also don’t know if I’ll regret it if I don’t try though.

post,"reapplying after transferring out of tech? need advice. throwaway account bc this stuff is kinda personal, but I was wondering if anyone had advice on my situation. sorry in advance if it’s sort of a dumb question 

so, i went to tech my freshman year. I had a horrible time due to friendships falling apart and my own horrible self esteem, but mostly it was due to things happening at home that I had no control over (e.g. schizophrenic mother, alcoholic father, younger brothers caught up in the heat of it and telling me, who wasn’t able to help them as I was out of state at tech for college). 

I didn’t end up finishing the year as I went home in March after having a breakdown and transferred to a school close to home to help deal with everything going on at home. 

a year and a half later, things at home have finally started looking up!! I finally feel stable; however, I hate the school I’m attending now. I miss tech and feel like I’d now be able to attend again.

I guess my question is: would just reapplying as a transfer be the best bet, or is there someone I should speak to about my situation beforehand?

I'm going to be starting grad school applications within a year. I'm not sure if I want to stay here to directly my PhD in Physics at gatech and stay in the US, or move back to Europe, or to instead go to Germany/Switzerland for MS+PhD and then find jobs from there.

I heard from others that most people abroad don't really know about how 'good' GT really is, and that they really only know MIT/Harvard. Not sure if the same goes for employers/natl labs (i.e. CERN/CNRS/Max Planck), though I know that my GT degree will be worth (way?) more in the US.

While many of you know Caleb Southern as a lecturer at GA Tech’s College of Computing, the music industry is celebrating Caleb’s first career as a music producer. Back in the 90’s Caleb produced legendary local bands Ben Folds Five, Archers of Loaf, Southern Culture on the Skids, Zen Frisbee, Shark Quest, among others. His production of *Whatever and Ever, Amen* by Ben Folds Five became a gold record in 1998.

With the success of Ben Folds Five, Caleb left college to tour with the band. He later returned to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and completed his degree in mathematics and computer science with honors. And now, 30 years later, the Chapel Hill community is celebrating Caleb and his impact on the music scene. Check out this artist line-up!

post,"Is Georgia Tech accepting of anime body pillows?.  Hello fellow Jackets (こんにちは), I’m an incoming freshman who's living in Woodruff and planning on majoring in CS. So here's the deal. I was assigned a double, which is far from what I wanted originally, after not being able to secure a single. And I decided to stick with it because of the price difference. After all, it would create a greater burden for my folks financially if I had a single or double, so I just decided to take the cheaper option. Oh well, not a big deal.

The only problem is that part of the reason I wanted a single was for the privacy it affords. I'm into anime and other obscure Japanese things and also happen to own a Waifu pillow (or 抱き枕, for my Japanese Jackets; I’m actually trying to learn Japanese btw). It's not that I'm into weird stuff or anything, I just wanted to be able to hang up my anime posters and figurines and have my pillow with me without feeling embarrassed and self-conscious about it around roommates. I mainly use the pillow for comfort when I sleep.

I know GT is progressive and open-minded, but I can't shake the feeling that my roommates will judge and make fun of me behind my back for sleeping with a Dakimakura. I’m really hoping I don’t get roomed with a couple of judgmental business majors, but I honestly don’t know what to expect. And it’s making me nervous to think that I’ll have a couple of wannabe frat bros who don’t understand my interests and will try to put me down for them.

Also, I have one of the more graphic and sexually suggestive waifu pillows. I don't want my roommates being offended at the sight of it every time they walk in the room. That's why I thought it would be best if I took the further bed so that they wouldn't have to stare at it since it would be out of their eye sight. In addition, any guests we have over would not have to see it either.

Do you guys think I should even bring it? I love my waifu pillow dearly and can't imagine myself sleeping without if I’m being totally honest.

I guess my question is: Is GT Dakimakura friendly?","Neutral

I was super excited to be at tech until I walked into my room and saw my roommate's sexually explicit waifu pillow on the bed (it looks kind of like [this one](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1408969578/genshin-impact-keqing-dakimakura-anime)). At first, I was okay with it because I don't want to judge as everyone has different interests, but that was until I woke up in the middle of my first night. It started with noises, and as my eyes adjusted to the light I witnessed unspeakable acts. I won't go into too much detail but the entire floor was soaked. At first I thought it was from the AC, but I realized it wasn't your standard water. There was enough to make a bowl of cereal. Everyone can have their own thing, but I'm just trying to sleep without thinking my AC is leaking.

Additionally, corporate companies used our Design Shop due to the wide range of equipment including our 3D printers, laser cutter, CNC Mill, lathe, and more. Unfortunately, they have been told their access has been revoked and they can no longer use our equipment. This will inevitably diminish our professional connections and job prospects for BME students in the real world. 

Please sign this petition to convince the BME department to bring the BME Design Shop back: https://www.change.org/p/bring-back-the-bme-design-shop.

I moved into my apartment at Uhouse at the beginning of August and noticed a few cockroaches, so l informed the leasing office via email without response.

There are dozens of them coming out through the walls and into mine and my roommate's boxes, and management has done little to help us.

Now I receive an email saying I got an override to register for an AO section, even though I did not request one. Does AO stand for async online? And why did I get an override? I took other async courses and don't recall any registration shenanigans or AO naming (which I've seen on several courses so far, all requiring an override to get in).

I don't want to take an async course. Should I expect some people to receive the same email and drop the WL, or is it just some glitch in the system?

post,"Anyone else having trouble with the Student Center parking deck?. I have a parking pass for the student center parking deck (W02), which has a digital pass system where cameras at both the entrance and exit open the gate if they scan your license plate and see you have a pass. I've been having trouble with this system though, I've pulled up to the gate before and waited a bit for the gate to open, but it didn't open and I had to instead get one of the tickets to get let in since people were in line behind me and I couldn't pull out and try another gate and see if that fixes it.  


The exit gate has been working, which is nice, except that if you get in by getting a ticket (which I'm often pressured to do), the system won't let you out even if it sees that you have a virtual pass because it says you're already out of the parking deck. I assume this is so that people don't take off the license plates of a car with a pass and use it to get their own car out of the parking deck without paying, but it's super frustrating because with the problems I've been having at the entrance gate combined with this policy of having to be let in through the automatic pass system to be let out with it, I've ended up having to pay about $15 for a day's worth of parking.  


Am I doing something wrong? Do you guys think I'm pulling up too far or that cars behind me might be blocking the camera's view of my license plate?

Hot ""takes"" like the above are not completely true and I'm setting the record straight. Almost everything here is factual and backed by sources.

&#x200B;

**Over the years, there have been changes that ease registration and access for Computing students,** sometimes to the chagrin of others.

* CS courses have major restrictions so Computing students can get into them. This was not always the case.
* In Fall 2012 the CoC employed [2 advisors](https://web.archive.org/web/20121020020605/http://www.cc.gatech.edu/current/undergraduates), Kathy and Cathy. That had grown to [7 by 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20160313082652/http://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/college-advising/undergraduate-advisors). [They now employ 15](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/undergraduate-advising-team) advisors. I have seen people complain about their advisor changing. Advisors often change because the workload has to be redistributed when someone new is hired.
* Double majors are heavily restricted in the CoC because you had students who would declare a double major just to take a few courses and then drop it, shutting CS majors out of courses they need to graduate.
* Thread restrictions are annoying, but they exist so students in those threads can get into classes they need. Thread restrictions were not a thing in \~2016-17.
* At one point, ML was [only offered in spring](https://web.archive.org/web/20150107215128/http://www.cc.gatech.edu/three-year-course-outline) and CV was only in fall. Now both are offered in the fall, spring, and sometimes summer, and this is also true for other courses (3630, 3790, 4210, 4460, 4660,...)

**The College of Computing hires new faculty every year**. Remember, the CoC is made up of *five* schools which all hire each year (i.e. this list is *nowhere near* exhaustive)

* [Fall 2019](https://www.cse.gatech.edu/news/624837/new-faculty-join-school-computational-science-and-engineering) \- School of CSE - 3 new hires
* [Fall 2020](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/news/638703/welcome-new-ic-faculty-seven-join-school-variety-research-areas) \- School of IC - 7 new hires
* [Fall 2021](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/academic-units-welcome-new-faculty-members) \- Computing wide - 11 new TT hires, 3 lecture track
* [Fall 2022](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/school-welcomes-four-new-assistant-professors) \- School of CSE - 4 new hires
* Fall 2023 - Offers have been accepted and we will meet the new professors soon.

With new faculty comes increased capacity in courses. **Shown is a table of popular courses and available seats over time.** Source: OSCAR.

\* - IDK what happened here. Fall 2018 and Spring 2020 had more students.

\*\* - Spring 2014, it was not offered in Fall 2013.

Not *every* course has scaled perfectly (3600/4641 sure haven't), but they are **not** ignoring demand.

""**If there are 200 people on the waitlist for CS XXXX, can't they just make another section??**""

Faculty teaching assignments are planned ahead of time. If they make a new section of an undergraduate course in the middle of registration, who would teach it? You *could* get a very senior PhD student, but good luck finding one who's willing. Where would this new section be taught? There aren't many large lecture halls on campus, and their dockets are full. You *could* have an online section, but the professor has to be willing to teach it, and some aren't. I'd bet the online sections we see this semester are taught by professors who agreed to it ahead of time.

TAs are another issue. [The CoC typically employs 1 TA for every 25 students](https://sci.cc.gatech.edu/faculty-hiring/) in lower division classes (ctrl+F 25). If a new section of CS XXXX with 200 seats appears a week before the term starts, 8 TAs must be hired. I'd hate to be the professor who has this new section dropped on them AND has to hire a bunch of TAs.

""**Why can't the stupid lazy useless advisors get me into an existing section??""** First off, [advisors are not lazy, stupid, nor useless](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/wwm6ft/comment/ilmhjuv/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

If you are a graduating senior (OAG filled out), they will bump you to the top of the waitlist for a class you need if you email them. They don't do it automatically because students often have multiple choices for classes to fulfill a requirement and advisors can't read your minds. If you're not graduating, they typically won't pull any strings because what's done for you *must be done for all* and space is limited.

""**But** ***other*** **schools don't have these issues!! Georgia Tech is the ONLY university in the world with problems because other places** ***CARE*** **about their students!!!""** This is not true. Read the complaints for yourself...

* UC Berkeley - [\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qbi2mq/is_cs_enrollment_especially_awful_this_year_or/), [\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qm8hfv/eecs_budget_discussion_on_eecs101/), [\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qnq7co/comment/hjk0zac/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

* Other places - [Georgia State](https://www.reddit.com/r/GaState/comments/qhsmaj/all_cs_classes_are_full/), [U of Maryland](https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/qly5ty/how_are_there_cmsc_classes_already_almost_full/), [UT Dallas](https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/dt2jj4/cs_registration_feels_worse_than_usual_this/), [Boston U](https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/qjv69g/cs_classes_full_or_closed_or_whatever/), [UW Madison](https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMadison/comments/qwhn1j/best_formal_action_to_take_against_uws_failures/), [Purdue](https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/v55zpx/cs_251_full_cant_take_major_required_course_next/)

I've seen people insist that GT should take a heavy-handed approach and start dramatically cutting CS enrollment. As the Berkeley and UT Austin links show, having restrictions doesn't erase problems. Doing this also introduces some access/equity issues that I can expand on if someone wants.

At many peer universities, especially public peers, CS is *locked down*. Do you *really* want to attend a university where you [compete](https://csd.cmu.edu/academics/bachelors/guidelines-transfer-or-dual-degree) with [your peers](https://cs.unc.edu/undergraduate/cs-admissions/) for spots in [the major](https://us.tamu.edu/getmedia/81566f1d-64c6-41a2-9f05-8266842f7cd3/BS-CPSC.pdf)? How about a place where CS is [off](https://cs.illinois.edu/admissions/undergraduate/transfer-students) limits [to](https://undergrad.soe.ucsc.edu/admitted-students/proposed-major-standing) you [altogether](https://advising.engineering.osu.edu/current-students/applying-your-major)?

**In a landscape where CS programs everywhere are getting restricted, it is not a bad thing that Georgia Tech has chosen not to follow its peers.**

I was going to offer a list of things that the CoC and other units can do to mitigate capacity issues, but this post is long enough. That will come in my [next thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/160bi05/how_academic_units_can_improve_the_registration/).

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** The College of Computing is well aware of space and capacity issues in courses and they have done a lot to mitigate these problems. They've hired faculty, increased space in courses, offered key thread picks more often, and a host of other things. The CoC prioritizes graduating students on waitlists, and advisors will not always bend over backward for you for many reasons, but it doesn't mean they don't care.

post,"How academic units can improve the registration process.. This post contains things that academic units should do to improve the registration process.

**If you're here to complain about OSCAR, scram!** Nobody at Georgia Tech has control over the software the Board of Regents makes us use. This is about things that they *can* control.

Anyway, lets get on with the list shall we?

* If seniors with early time tickets can't register because courses are full, *who can*? That's the million dollar question that we need an answer to.
* Advisors should procure a roster of graduating seniors in their penultimate semester. OAGs are filled out the semester before so I think this is feasible. They would then survey students to get final semester courses and the CoC/other units would create sections just for them at the same time/place as the regular section. This would happen before registration starts.
   * Example: Assume Computer Vision is in a room with 200 seats. If there are 30 graduating seniors, there would be sections with 30 and 170 students (or more if space allows). The designated section would only be for graduating seniors for whom CV fulfills a requirement. If you're graduating and you want to take CV as a free elective, join the waitlist.
   * ""But what about people who *aren't* graduating??"" If someone is graduating and they have to take CV, they need the course more than you. We can at least agree on *that* right?
* If upper division courses are disproportionally filled with underclassmen, put a credit hour restriction on them. This is already a thing with CS 4400.
   * **(CONTROVERSIAL TAKE)** If this is an Institute-wide issue then for students that enter as first-years, *only* hours earned at Tech should count toward time tickets. For transfer students, all hours should count. I do not think a first-year with 66 AP/DE hours should have registration priority over a 3rd year with 60 and transfers are generally expected to graduate sooner. Anybody who came in with a ton of credits have thoughts on this? What courses do first years with a ton of credit usually take?
* If CS courses are disproportionally filled with non-CoC students, tighten restrictions on when non majors can register. If those non-CoC students are Computing minors then have sections for them if capacity allows, similar to the second bullet point. Scheller does this with T&M courses. I believe CS minors are allowed to get a permit to register for one CS course during phase I, so it shouldn't be that difficult to get a count of minors trying to take a specific course.

These are my honest critiques of registration. Let's discuss this.

SGA IT Board is looking for new members across our variety of teams.

[https://forms.office.com/r/KZwKepJdbB](https://forms.office.com/r/KZwKepJdbB)

**What is SGA IT Board?**

SGA IT Board is a branch of the SGA executive branch. Part of our work is advocating on a variety of institute committees, for stuff from data governance to wifi outages. A bulk of our work, though, comes in the form of our technical solutions that we create with our 9 different products/teams. These solutions are all born from one initative: recognizing issues that students on our campus face, and solving them with the creation of a new project.

**Who should apply?**

We've got uses for everyone! If you're somebody who cowards at the sight of HTML (me), we do a lot of fun AWS work. If you're into UI/UX and want to make good looking websites and apps, we want you! We have people who help throw some tech related events, no coding skills required! In essence, we're looking for any skill level in any discipline!

**More info?**

Our SGA website has more information on what exactly the teams are, what they do, and also what technology stack they are working with. You can find that here: [https://www.sga.gatech.edu/it/](https://www.sga.gatech.edu/it/)

post,"DS @ GT, GT Athletics Project Informational Meeting. Hi There!

I am the project lead for the GT Athletics project for Data Science @ GT ([https://datasciencegt.org/](https://datasciencegt.org/)).

The official description of my project is  *The GT Basketball Scheduling Assistant project aims to enhance Georgia Tech basketball's prospects of consistently making it to the NCAA championship by strategically managing the selection of their non-conference opponents.* 

To explain in a bit less jargon, our project is attempting to bridge the gap between the archaic analytics used by many college basketball teams (Georgia Tech) included to the ones used in the NBA, other professional sports leagues, and in other industries. The scheduling assistant is just one of many ideas I'd like to undertake this semester.

Outside of this I have a goal of having info sessions with various minds within the sports analytics fields through the semester, for example we have a Q&A with Ken Pomeroy lined up in only a few weeks.

If any of this sounds mildly interesting to you, I encourage you to come to our project kickoff meeting (No obligation, no dues to attend this meeting) on Tuesday August 29th at 5pm in CoC 16. In addition if you rsvp with this form it'd be much appreciated ([https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRE43h8tqG9DVemJamTSF0h45E05Q1UGDwUFLGKNWr5n3W7A/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRE43h8tqG9DVemJamTSF0h45E05Q1UGDwUFLGKNWr5n3W7A/viewform?usp=sf_link))

I know this might sound really dumb but I am a very anxious person and it would really help me to know in advance the process of going to the CRC to swim laps. So I’ll break this down into a few questions if anyone would be willing to answer.

1. Where in the CRC is the pool facility? If I walk in the front entrance of the CRC, will the pool be easy to find?
2. Once I get to the pool facility, do I have to sign in or anything? Or do I just lock my stuff in a locker and head to the pool?
3. Which pool is for casual lap swimming? The CRC website shows hours for the McAuley Aquatic Center and the Crawford Leisure Pool. I’m pretty out of shape so I’ll be a slow swimmer. So which pool am I supposed to / allowed to swim laps in?
4. If there are multiple people using one lane, is the etiquette to split the lane or circle swim?
5. Would it be a bad idea to keep my phone like, on a bleacher or something with my towel instead of locked in a locker? Would it get stolen that way?
6. Also, if I go to swim laps at around 8:30am on a weekday, is it going to be really busy? Or should I go earlier?

post,"Didn't report my outside fund to the financial aid office. Didn't report an outside fund because I didn't know I needed to. My tuition has already been paid through my student account by the donor. However, the FINAID department sent me an email saying the scholarship must go through the financial aid office, 2 hours before the tuition payment deadline. Will they cancel my tuition payment transaction and refund the money to my donor? If so I would probably drop out from all the courses I registered for.

post,"Does anyone know anything MBA admissions?. Hey! KSU guy here. 

I’m interested in applying to the MBA program here, but I have zero desire whatsoever to take the GMAT. I did notice however though that the MBA program considers LSAT scores in place of the GMAT. My plan as of right now is to apply to law school, but I would like to have some other options available to me once I graduate. 

I have a LSAT score that is right around the 80th percentile. The accepted GMAT scores here are around the same percentile. Does anyone know if this is equivalent in the admissions council’s eyes? Or is this a similar situation to where law schools accept the GRE in place of the LSAT, but expect a much higher score for admissions since it is not specific for law school?",Neutral,MBA admissions and LSAT scores.,1,2023-08-29,"mba, admissions, lsat, scores, law school, gre"

post,"How to have a capstone group help build an app?. Background: I am a recent graduate that majored in NOT CS. An Aunt of mine has thought of an app for a specific, but very large sector of business. She says that there are no competitor apps for this area of interest. She has not told me much but it is in her line of work of real estate. The app needs to be phone and computer compatible too with several functions.

She asked if it was possible to have a CS capstone group or something alike help code her app in exchange of a royalty. I asked some of my older XS friends if this was possible. They said it was likely possible but I needed to reach out. I do not know who to reach out to, nor how many of this works relating to the CS Capstone project. 

If anyone can point me in the right direction or provide a professor or two',s names, that would be a big help.
