Due to an extraordinary lack of judgement on someone's part, I've been asked back again to speak to the ECE student seminar next Wednesday at 11:15am in Klaus 2443. Please come and join us, all are welcome although only those registered will be getting credit.

The title of the talk is ""Beyond Engineering: Marketing, Sales, &amp; Management with an Engineering Degree"". Here's the abstract that was posted [here](https://gatech.instructure.com/courses/32398/announcements/99761):

*Your career as an engineer can take you to some unexpected places, many of them outside of what is considered “pure engineering”. Using an autobiographical and anecdotal format, \[the speaker\] will walk through career branches and options from small startups to large conglomerates, from low-level employee to the leader of a pivotal group, from a job in a lab to a job with a million frequent flier miles, and from a job that’s pure engineering to a career beyond engineering.* 

It's usually entertaining and hopefully useful. And I always enjoy staying afterward and talking with students.

Here's this year's twist. I recently published a book based loosely on these lectures and I have a few copies that I can hand out. PM me at least 1 day before the show and I'll bring you a free copy.

post,"Is it too hard to get Recommendation Letters from GT ECE/CS professors for PhD programs elsewhere (as an ECE MS student) ?. Background:

Hello everyone. I have been accepted for the Fall 2019 semester at GaTech for the MS in ECE program. I am currently enrolled in my first semester (MS ECE) at Southern Illinois University, with tuition waiver and TA. It's a pretty mediocre school with hardly any good Labs and I am considering to transfer to GT from here in the Fall (I don't really care if they accept credit or not, would be nice if they did though). Anyway, I am an international student and will have to pay for my MS at GT so I am carefully considering the options (since I am already in a program). I think I can afford to come at Tech.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am interested in the Machine Learning and Computer Vision/Perception track and am planning on looking for some professors in the College of Computing to advise me.

I feel like I might want to go into academia, hence I want to get a PhD from a top school in my field and be exposed to better research labs.

1. Now, if I go to GaTech I will be able to join their PhD program if I can manage a professor. In that case it will be a good outcome for me. How doable is this?
2. If I can't get a desired Professor to take me in, I can finish my coursework and get out with an MS, apply for a PhD somewhere else, in a Lab that would be a better fit for me (my current coursework is quite disjoint with the work I want to pursue). But I heard it would be very difficult as an MS student to get Recommendations from professors for applying to PhD programs elsewhere, how true is this? One of my friends at GT specifically told me that it would be very hard to get Letters as a MS student since the duration is just 3 semesters. 

Thanks.

post,"Starbucks @ West Village Complaint/Observation. Ever since the Starbucks at West Village started taking meal swipes and therefore made it a reasonable situation that a student would use all four meal swipes provided in a meal plan on a daily basis, the wait time and the selection has generally been awful.

Generally, all drinks (frappes, coffee drinks, hot chocolate, refreshers, etc.) will be available through say Tuesday (after restocking on Monday) at best, and frappes often start 'running out' before the evening hours on W, R, and F and are nonexistent on the weekends. They often run out of 'mocha' as well, unable to make hot chocolate; and in the case of the last couple of days, have even run out of lemonade and the refreshers. 

Not to mention that the bakery items often run out by the evening every day, meaning that the only meal swipe option is a grande beverage instead of a tall beverage and a bakery item, which provides much more value for the meal swipe.

I think that since GT Dining is not making any marginal revenue off allowing students to use their meal swipe at Starbucks (as that meal swipe would often go unused otherwise), they are doing a poor job at appropriately staffing and stocking it as to minimize its use by students forced into overpaying for the freshman meal plan.
