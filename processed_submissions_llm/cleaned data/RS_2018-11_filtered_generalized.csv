post,"Let's talk about the student employees. Look, I get it. GT is a hard school and, a lot of the time, we aren't in good moods. However, I've noticed (this semester especially) that the student employees in the student center are just downright moody and annoyed at the students that they service. Whether it's at the package pickup window, the info desk, tech rec, etc. - everywhere I've gone this semester in the student center, there's been an employee that's been rude to me. I've even gotten to the point where I recognize the few have been nice to me and only go to pick up a package or whatever when they're working, because otherwise it's just not worth it to be in a shitty mood for the rest of the day.

A lecturer cannot take care of 200+ students. But when we get to TA office hour, there are sometimes not enough TAs to ask quesion on exam or projects. Sometimes it takes several weeks to grade a project. It's also understandable because TAs are also students. They are busier cuz most of them are seniors or juniors.
