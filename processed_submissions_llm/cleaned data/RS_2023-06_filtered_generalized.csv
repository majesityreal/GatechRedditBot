As we passed, you seemed to glide, no, fly past me in a whirlwind of color.

In that moment, all of my other worries and desires melted away.  I only thought of you.

I knew immediately that I wanted to ride you, but it was too late — you had already left.  There was no chance for me to approach your entrance.  I collapsed onto a bench, heartbroken.  Was this passing by destined to happen?  Was I to be forever alone?

post,"Should I commute from OTP? Or find an apartment off campus?. I don't think I'll get housing next year, and I'm weighing the pros and cons of commuting versus getting a pricey off campus apartment. I commuted last year to another school about 20-25 minutes North of my parents house in the McDonough area, and didn't mind it too much. 

My issue is that I'm not sure how bad traffic normally is going to and fro McDonough to GT in the mornings/evenings. Google Maps says about 30-40 minutes without traffic, but I'm also considering MARTA from College Park (not sure how to plan for that either since the train only runs every 20 minutes). It doesn't help that most of my classes for fall are probably going to be super spread apart, and it's looking like multiple 2-4 hour gaps everyday M-F will be the norm.

Have any other Jackets done the commute from OTP? And if so, do y'all have any tips or tricks? Also, if anyone can link to a resource where I can find some more affordable student housing near campus I'd greatly appreciate it! Thanks for your time!



Edit: Forgot to mention a couple of things, firstly - I'm a new transfer trying to get my bearings straight at GT with the transition over the summer. Secondly, my parents are really reluctant to help out with most of my college costs - they were both OTP commuters to GT/GSU respectively in the 90's and had to work their way through college. They currently make way too much for me to qualify for any other aid than HOPE too (EFC of $40k+), so I'm kinda SOL with financial aid. I understand that there are very few colleges worth taking out loans for - and GT is certainly one of the 'worth it' schools - just looking to check all my options and see if anyone can offer some wisdom before I commit to anything!

post,"Writing a book, main character goes to GA Tech, need a few social questions answered!!. Hi all! I'm doing some research for a novel I'm writing and my main character (20F) is a sophomore at Georgia Tech and she grew up in Atlanta as well. The majority of the book does not take place in Atlanta but I do want authentic background information for her since some scenes take place as memories. Problem is, I've never been to Georgia myself. Anyways, my questions:

  
\- What are some local bars/clubs that sororities girls might go to and a follow up, do they have any fun themed nights? I remember the local bar at my personal uni did $2 tequila shot Tuesdays so that is the kind of thing I'm looking for. 

\- Which frats/srats usually pair at Georgia Tech? I'm thinking of making her a Zeta, so I guess any info about ZTA at GT would be great!! 

\- Dining hall dirt please! What is the best one and what kind of food do they normally serve? 

\- She is a biology major, so fun notes specific to bio labs or classrooms would be great

\- Do sophomores typically live in dorms? If yes, which ones would be more apartment style than strictly dorm-with-the-shared-hall-bathroom style? (I know sophs in greek life can live in the house, but I want her to stay in the dorms a little longer and in book two she will move to the sorority house)

post,"Career/Academic Path Advice for a Computer Engineering Major. Hello everyone,

I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech with a focus on Distributed Systems & Software Design and Devices. I hold a 3.95 GPA and am also pursuing a dual degree program with Emory University, studying Physics (3.90 GPA).

I have completed two internships in China related to computer vision and autonomous driving. In the former, I utilized YOLOv5 to train a license plate detection model, and in the latter, I worked on improving the occupancy network and am expecting to submit a paper to CVPR and got a strong recommendation letter from the CEO.

In addition to my internships, I have ongoing research experience in human activity recognition, with plans to submit a paper to CVPR (also a recommendation letter if everything goes well). I've also completed three course projects and am currently working on a senior design project related to indoor localization.

My future plan involves either working in the US or pursuing graduate studies. While Georgia Tech offers a BS/MS program, I'm considering applying to other schools like CMU, Stanford, and Berkeley for potentially better employment prospects.

Despite my Computer Engineering major, I've learned more towards computer science in terms of coursework and internship experience. Now, I'm unsure whether I should apply for ECE or CS programs for grad school.

Given my background, what would you recommend? ECE or CS? Additionally, do you have any specific advice regarding the grad school application process, particularly for top schools?

post,"We’re joining the Reddit blackout from June 12th to 14th to protest the planned API changes that will kill 3rd party apps. Howdy r/gatech

It’s been a minute since we had one of these mod posts, as this is mostly a pretty tight knit, drama free community. I’m sure you’ve read half a dozen of these by now, but it’s worth stating our participation and support of the blackout put on by subreddits across this site.

Recently Reddit corporate has announced changes to the API pricing structure that would effectively kill every 3rd party application used to access the site. Apps like Apollo, Reddit is Fun, Narwhal, and others will no longer work as they will now cost literal millions to operate in overhead costs.

Here’s a good TLDR on some of the other impacts of this API change, including that it'll break screen readers for the seeing impaired: https://i.imgur.com/E7jSWf1.jpg

Many of the bots that have been in use on this subreddit such as the GT risk bot will no longer be operational either.

**Why should GT care?**

It wasn’t that long ago that I was a wee little first year sitting in Under the Couch building my first API scraper using the reddit API, and these little projects helped solidify my choice of major and lead to the career I have today. I gave presentations to my previous company on the robustness of this API.

If you care about open source software, about a free and open internet, and about the ability to post, this is important. It’s hard not to sound like a boomer a bit here, but the internet is nowhere near as open as it was when I was young and this balkanization seems only likely to continue as corporations in pursuit of infinite growth look to further monetize their user bases.

Will this blackout fix things? Judging by the last one, probably not. But this is really all we can do. I’ve done my part to be amongst the least valuable Daily Active Userbase of all social media sites, but if they want to show us the door, who are we to disagree?

**What you can do**

While subs going dark is one thing, regular users can help as well.

Reach out to Reddit via the channels available to you: Modmail [r/reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit), comment in relevant posts regarding the API changes, submit your comments via the contact forms.

Spread the word about the changes and the consequences where you can. Doesn't have to be on Reddit. The important thing is getting it attention.

Participate in the communities that highlight this issue: [r/Save3rdPartyApps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps), [r/apolloapp](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp), [r/redditisfun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun), [r/getnarwhal/](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/)

And finally stay off Reddit completely from June 12th to 14th. The blackout is one thing, but users staying away from the site entirely will send an equally important message.

But don't forget: Don't be a jerk. As frustrating as this is, being toxic or aggressive is not the way to go.

However, when it comes to deciding if I want to transfer a big part of that is how I feel about the campus and academics. It just so happens ill be traveling to Atlanta here in a few weeks and wanted to take the opportunity to tour Georgia Tech. 

&#x200B;

Ive noticed there aren't any ""official"" tours happening, just the opportunity for self-guided tours. But I was wondering if there was the possibility to meet with professors and discuss about the academics and individualized courses? More specifically Im interested in AI, Computer Science, and Cybersecurity. I didnt know where to begin or who to reach out to about it though.

post,"As a continued protest against Reddit's API changes, we are implementing ""Touch Grass Tuesdays"". As the blackout approached the end date, we began looking at what to do as a next step. Some subreddits are staying dark indefinitely, including many large subreddits such as r/music and r/videos.

This subreddit, however, is not well suited to remain private indefinitely. A lot of people use r/gatech for information or advice that is important to their education and college life. **We're not going to take that away.** At the same time, some of you noted protests work best when there is no end date. There won't be one.

The biggest impact the blackout has made so far is to cause concern among companies who advertise on Reddit. What we intend to do is to follow hundreds of other subreddits in hitting advertising revenue *again* while maintaining the community's usability. Starting from next week, **the subreddit will be private again every Tuesday**, the day with the highest ad revenue / ROI, in a protest movement called “Touch Grass Tuesday”. You will not be able to access the sub on that day - but we will return the day after. The aim is to confirm the advertising companies' concerns by causing the highest profit loss to disruption ratio, in a sustainable, ongoing way and we intend to continue this until the situation improves.

We aim to balance our individual community’s interest with the larger sitewide problems, and we are reading your input on Discord and elsewhere, so please let us know your thoughts. As always, as a small-sized sub, we follow the direction of the larger mod community: our protest will end when demands are met, when directed by the larger leadership, or when unable to continue.

If you are looking for a great way to make friends, a unique accomplishment for your resume, internet fame, and a sea of riches (kind of)... look no further! Join Survivor Club at Georgia Tech TODAY!!  Now, you might be asking yourself... what exactly is Survivor Club? Survivor Club is a group of students passionate about strategic games, video editing, friendly competition, pushing the limits of their strengths, conquering their weaknesses, creating strong friendships and connections, and of course, the greatest social experiment ever conducted, the CBS reality tv show, Survivor.

Throughout the semester, we host watch parties for episodes of the CBS show and this upcoming fall, we will be hosting watch parties for the very first season of Survivor: Georgia Tech, filmed in fall 2022. Join us for game nights, reality tv mini games, puzzles, challenges, and more!

Now to get to the part you've all been waiting for.... every semester, Survivor Club casts 16-20 students to participate in a semester long college adapted game of the show Survivor. Students begin the game divided into tribes, competing against the other tribe for safety from tribal council. Mid-game, students will merge into one tribe and the game becomes individually focused. Playing the semester long game is the ultimate test of one's mental and physical strengths, social skills, and willpower. Friendships will be made, promises broken, rivalries born, and all of it will be recorded, edited, and uploaded onto YouTube.

post,"Mod Post: Poll and Follow-up to Touch Grass Tuesday. Afternoon r/gatech,

As many of y’all are aware, we came off of private this morning after the first of our “Touch Grass Tuesdays” as discussed in this post here: https://old.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/14allju/as_a_continued_protest_against_reddits_api/

In this and the prior post, we received quite a bit of feedback on the stance we were taking both positive and negative, and we want to ensure that your voices are heard and that we make decisions together that best serve our collective interests. Additionally, the administrators of Reddit Inc. have made further antagonizing actions against moderators, going so far as to [liquidate the mod teams of subreddits pushing against their policies](https://old.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/14eqtma/apparently_the_entire_mod_team_of/) and [threatening to de-mod the r/gatech mod team should we leave this subreddit private](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/623653807867428870/1121095101813379072/image.png). This is on top of further revelations that Reddit does not have any current accessibility experts on staff, [so all of the promises made were yet another lie. ](https://old.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/)

The current state of mod tooling on reddit is untenable, and there seems to be no willingness from the admins to back down from their position. I’ve been a mod on reddit for close to 7 years, and reddit has yet to add modding features beyond those created previously with 3rd party extensions. In light of this situation, we are initiating a poll to determine the future course of action for our subreddit. These options will be posted in locked comments below. Feel free to vote for either, neither, or both.

Options for Consideration (Links take you to the comment to vote):

1.	**[Continue Going Private Every Tuesday](https://old.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/14fcf6p/mod_post_poll_and_followup_to_touch_grass_tuesday/joz9apu/)**: We maintain our practice of going private every Tuesday as a response to the threats directed towards our mod team and the impacts on the Reddit API. By doing so, we aim to demonstrate solidarity and protest against any unjust treatment. This will likely result in us being removed as moderators, unfortunately.
2.	**[Keep the Subreddit Open as Normal](https://old.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/14fcf6p/mod_post_poll_and_followup_to_touch_grass_tuesday/joz9e0e/)**: We will remain open to all members, discussions, and activities, adhering to our current policies and guidelines.

In both of these options, we will be adding messaging similar to the comment from r/games on all posts to this subreddit.

Frankly, this situation fucking sucks. We didn’t want to be here. The subreddit being private sucks for y’all, and the actions of the admins can be most generously described as “fairly antagonistic”. I’m not expecting y’all to have much pity for people doing it F O R F R E E, but this is seriously disappointing from a site where I and the rest of the team have provided dozens of hours of unpaid jannie work.

Let us know your thoughts below. This poll will be open for 1 week, then we will revisit. 


**We will be following the direction of this poll.**

post,"How far is too far for off campus housing?. Hello everyone!

I'm currently at a bit of a reflection point after making it to GT. [A couple of weeks ago, I asked the community if commuting from McDonough was too far](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1412g7z/should_i_commute_from_otp_or_find_an_apartment/), after a barrage of some fantastic comments (which I cannot thank y'all enough for!) - moving out seems to be the right choice.

Here's my issue - and what seems to be a lot of people's issue in the coming weeks. On campus housing appears totally full, and of my roommate party 3/4 of us have received waitlist notifications literal minutes after completing the application. ***Can any upperclassmen advise us in this situation - did y'all get housing after being on a waitlist, or are we SOL?***

Another issue we have is of cost, I truthfully was hoping to get harris or woodruff thanks to the total cost being less that 8k for a year with a parking pass. This seems to be a total sweet spot in terms of what I (and another one of my friends) can pull of financially. I was also planning on doing study abroad next summer, which I can't do if I'm off campus since everywhere we looked required 12 month leases (2 of my friends also want to be able to go back home for summers too).

The cheapest off campus housing option appears to be WestMar student lofts, at about $900 a month (\~$11k a year). The issue is that it's about 20 minutes removed from campus - so I'm wondering if it's even worth it at this point. [WestMar also doesn't have the best reputation on here at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/u1nofi/person_found_shot_dead_in_front_of_student_lofts/), and [I didn't even know about this one until I googled the name while typing this](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/man-shot-at-student-housing-complex-party-atlanta-police-say/SFXQIUSXVFG6FFHKKMPBE6TLYE/). ***Has anyone on here lived at WestMar?*** And if so, can you give some insight into whether or not you think it was worth it and how your time was? How was the shuttle - and was safety an issue while there? We're 4 pretty quiet guys who will most definitely stick to ourselves if that helps.

Our issue is that it's pretty much all of our first times at a big college with actual things to too (2 in state, 2 out of state). None of us want our time here to be ruined or tainted, and we're trying our best to do whatever we can to make it work. GT administration has literally given us absolutely no support whatsoever, and if anything has actually made this process harder by telling us all conflicting information. (They told me that we'd have housing at Harris since they were almost all saved, but then told my friend they had absolutely nothing available.)

The next cheapest option we can find, without dealing with subleasing in HomePark, is about $1100 a month at Catalyst midtown with a $125 a month parking pass cost (\~$15k a year). I simply just cannot afford this - I'm totally out of luck with FinAid, and got absolutely nothing besides unsub loans. We talked and have no idea how to handle pursuing HomePark since we'd need furniture, and need to deal with utilities - which put the total monthly cost well over the $900 a month of WestMar.

We've tried looking just about everywhere online through the official channels ([GT's off campus website](https://offcampus.housing.gatech.edu/listing), apartments.com, zillow, etc) - but we just can't seem to find anything. We're all a little lost at this point, and would really appreciate if someone in the community could reach out and provide an olive branch and help guide us to a better place!

Thank you all for your time! And I truly appreciate it!

post,"Don't live at U House (ranting). I'm sure UHouse isn't the only student housing in the area with similar issues, but for the amount of money we're paying for rent, some of these things shouldn't be problems.

Bigger things:

* Moving in: Our unit and my room had clearly not been cleaned before we moved in. I had literal trash and clumps of hair all over my room floor as soon as I walked in. I had mold growing in my shower and urine stains on my toilet seat. There was trash left in the laundry room (and some old clothes next to the machines) from previous tenants. The HVAC vent in the kitchen was just clogged with dust. I showed the building manager photos, but he just shrugged and went on with his day. I'm not expecting a luxury resort when moving in, but if you charge the previous tenants a cleaning fee upon moving out, at least pick up the trash.


* Elevators: Elevators were a mess for the first month or so when moving in. The back set of elevators (by the Taco Bell stairs) were completely down for about a month or so, leaving the front elevators for the whole building. But surprise, of course only 1 of those happened to be in service at a time. Taking stairs every time if you live on a higher floor isn't ideal, but it was still faster than waiting 30+ minutes for the elevator to get you to your floor, since everyone just had to press the button for every floor. It was also suspicious that some of the elevators had inspection cards that expired in 2021/June 2022 when moving in August 2022, but I'm sure that they were still compliant and that the office had the right paperwork upon request lol. The new issue with the elevators is that the button for your floor might get punched in. So naturally you'd think it'd be ok in this case to just get off one floor above or below yours and take the stairs, but then you'd realize that your key card doesn't work in one of the stairwells to enter your floor, and you're trapped, so you need to go all the way down to exit the building, then take different elevators or the other stairwell. I've also recently had friends get stuck in the elevators, so there's that.


* Water outages: This could be a consequence of living closer to construction sites, but we've had a lot of random water outages, especially since the start of 2023. Closer to the beginning of April, my unit had no water for about 36 hours due to a burst pipe in the building (although there was water on some lower floors, so I just got ready for the day in the lobby bathroom). I actually noticed some water damage on the ceiling and walls in our unit in January, and I showed management as well. I'm not saying it's due to a lack of preventative maintenance, because I have no proof of that, but surprise surprise, I've counted about 4 outages in the last few months, each with their own unique stores from management. Life lesson: keep a couple of gallons of water and some old plastic water bottles in your apartment to take a quick shower before class.


* Packages: I've lived in several different apartment complexes before (in and out of Atlanta), but I've never had as many packages lost as I have had here.


* Security: There was a break-in to an apartment about a month ago, and I've heard stories of this happening several times here in previous years. The only change I've noticed is that a security officer will now occasionally walk through a couple of floors in the evening, but this leaves no one at the front security desk.


* Parking garage gate: The gate has been left open overnight multiple times over the past few months, although I'm assuming it was due to some maintenance issues. What's the point of paying $130/month for gated parking if the gate is left open though?


Micro aggressions that aren't too bad:

* Wifi: Wifi issues might be isolated to my unit, but it's been really spotty all year. There's a good bit of buffering while streaming, but video calls/meetings are particularly bad. I started calling into meetings with the phone number it gives you in case I got kicked off on my laptop. My roommate that uses ethernet hasn't had any issues, though, so I don't think it's an issue with the ISP per se.


* Pool: the pool was shut down for a majority of the year, at first because someone dropped broken glass into the pool and it had to be cleaned out, then I'm assuming weather? But once it was finally opened a few weeks ago, I went to go check it out, and it was disgusting. Like the floor of the pool was just brown, with a lot of dirt floating. I understand that it is an outdoor pool though, and it won't be perfectly clean 24/7, but it's still annoying.


* ButterflyMX and side door: I actually really like ButterflyMX when it works (the door doesn't actually unlock when you swipe to unlock on the app/put in your door pin about 20% of the time). It worked great for a little while when it was first installed. Then, the system went down at the front door for a couple of weeks, leaving everyone to go in through the parking garage, creating more elevator issues. What made it worse though is that the Taco Bell stairs door to get into the building has been chained up for the past several months, seemingly because they can't get a hold of the parts to replace the door handle (?). The elevators on that side are working though, so you could still walk over to those elevators after getting into the building, but it's just inconvenient to do so. Not the biggest deal, but that side door is still unusable.


* Appliances: Most of the appliances are relatively older and starting to fall apart at the same time (around now). They're not the most efficient appliances I've ever used, but they get the job done for the most part. Maintenance is usually pretty good about at least addressing issues within 1 business day, so that helps.


There's some bigger stuff I'd rather not share online. I understand that complaining doesn't help the situation, but my word of advice is that any deal that they offer you for lower rent isn't worth the savings. I can't wait to see the move out charges after I do lol. Find somewhere else (probably for cheaper) if U House rent prices fit your budget, but if you're able to shell out a little more money, it's definitely worth the premium to live at a different off campus student housing.

I will say that the office staff (non management) and the maintenance crews are some of the nicest people I've ever met, and they genuinely try to do their best to get things that they can resolved ASAP. A lot of stuff is pretty much out of their hands, though.

post,"Advice: doing part-time internship while taking 3 grad classes?. I am a CS masters student and I have 3 more classes to go before graduating. I have an option to either do a 20hr part-time internship (which I have an offer for) or be a TA (which is still pending). 

The TA position can give a tuition waiver which would be sick but it’s not the most critical thing since I can afford to pay the tuition bill.

The part-time job is a continuation of my current co-op and with an almost certainty, will be my full-time job after I graduate. My boss is pushing me to accept this part time job but he understands if I want the TA position. 

The thing is, being here for many months has led me to be in charge of multiple projects including one complex still-in-dev one for which I am the sole creator and maintainer. It’s gonna be devastating for me if that project just goes to waste because no one is there to maintain it in the fall. The continuity in the projects of the midsize company has a weight here and that is pushing me to accept this part time position.

But I am concerned if I am mentally able to take it with my course load which includes Deep Learning. 

On the other side, I am confident of taking the TA with my classes as I’ve been a TA at Tech many times.

post,"GT Orchestra / Music program / Application process for HS. I’m currently in my senior year of high school, and I was wondering about the GT music program, and how to apply, or get into the school. I’ve done my best to research and find out, but most of what I saw was limited information, so I’m hoping a student at GT has some idea where I can start. 

My main question is how do I get into GT school of music, and in the process I do, is it the same thing as getting into GT in general? My biggest concern is if music doesn’t work out for me, and I want to transfer, or switch majors, will I be able to do that since I’d be “Accepted into GT” or because the orchestra is a different part of the school, I would have to reapply? 

From the limited information I was told, if I wanted to join the orchestra / music department, instead of going through the application process, I’d have to audition instead, how far am I off from here?

I have one question about transfer credit to meet the english requirement here at Georgia Tech.

Also, do AP courses and scores appear on a college transcript? GaTech admissions said to make sure that your AP courses show up along side what credits that course gives you. Is it normal to have the name of the ap class shown in a college transcript?

post,"Likelihood of securing a GTA/GRA for an AE master’s degree. Rising GT ChemE senior here— I’ve decided that I want to go to grad school for AE, but am facing a difficult financial decision. Here are my two options:

1) Accept a full-time return offer for the company I am interning at and get a virtual master’s degree paid for, which I would have to complete on my own time. I’d also have to commit to working at this company for a few extra years which I’m not too sure about.

2) Reject a full-time return offer OR accept a return internship for next summer, and go back to Tech in Fall ‘24 for an in-person master’s degree which I would have to fund through GTA/GRAs. This option would also let me partake in other internships before graduation.

I prefer option 2 but am worried about funding availability. So my question is, how hard is it to get a GTA or GRA as a master’s student?
