post,"North Ave Dining Early Closing and Food Problem Today. Can a Aramark Student Ambassador please explain why North Ave closed at 8pm today when it was supposed to close at 9pm and why the workers did not replenish any food until right before closing?

I came in at 7pm to go to North Ave, and they did not have any food aside from the vegetarian and burger station. I have attached a picture for proof.

It was like this for a good 30min at least: [https://imgur.com/a/BLeebyO](https://imgur.com/a/BLeebyO)

Not to mention there was no server (although I am perfectly ok with that if food is self serve).

Some other students and I have repeatedly asked if there would be more food -- and while the workers said they will, it wasn't 7:40 that there was new food. As soon as I went to get food, the North Ave Dining lights started to turn on/off and one of the workers said it was going to close at 8pm. 10 min later they cleared out all the food stations as well, basically forcing us to leave.

&amp;#x200B;

It clearly states on the GT Dining North Ave Website AND on the Posted Notices in the Dining Halls that during this Labor Day Weekend North Ave Dining will be open from 10am-9pm.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I am writing this because this is not the first time there has been delays in food restock, and steps should be taken so you don't waste students time.",Negative,Complaint about early closing and food problems at North Ave Dining.,128,2019-08-31,"dining, complaint, food, closing, problems, north ave, aramark, student ambassador, explanation, replenishment, vegetarian, burger, station, picture, proof, server, students, asked, delays, restock, steps, time, labor day, weekend, website, notices, wasted."

post,"I don't know who needs to hear this, but take care of your mental health. After five years of being gone from tech, I sincerely hope that our counseling center, and psychiatry services are doing a better job. If you have a history of mental illness, and feel like you might have some struggles this semester, go ahead, and look into booking your appointments now. The counseling center in my time was pretty good, despite the plethora of paperwork. The psychiatry department was objectively terrible though. If you're suffering from anxiety, or ADHD, don't even bother. I once saw a kid visibly suffering a panic attack, and they just told him to make an appointment. Back then, that was nothing short of a month long wait. The psychiatrist I had was extremely deceptive, and lazy. She heard that I'd been diagnosed with depression, even though I was there because I was more concerned with ADHD, and she didn't tell me that they were unable to actually prescribe anything for that. She put me on a dangerous dose of antidepressants that made me feel like a zombie. Find outside help if you can. After I left, it took two years of trying different psychiatrists, and after a particularly bad suicide attempt, I finally got diagnosed with bipolar, along with anxiety, and the ADHD I'd known about since I was five. I'm not going to tell you they don't care, but I will say that in my experience, they were understaffed, and dishonest about what they could do for you. I'm happy to say that I finally got the care I needed, but only after I moved home. I didn't finish my last semester at tech, but I finally got a degree. Don't let yourself get in a bad spot. Schedule early, and look for psych services off campus. That's my advice for the freshmen, and anyone else. Tech is a tough school, but you got in, and you can get out. Stay strong.

&gt;I am thrilled to be back at a place that means so much to my family and me, and I am honored to be able to work with you and serve this remarkable institution.

&gt;Since I was selected in June by the Board of Regents, I have spent a great deal of time learning about the Institute. I have spoken with members of our administration and the University System of Georgia, board members, elected officials, alumni, and friends. I have read briefings and reports. Having been on the Georgia Tech Advisory Board for the most part of the last decade, I thought I was reasonably well aware of what was going on. But what Georgia Tech has accomplished over the last years is even more impressive than I knew. 

&gt;We attract some of the most talented students from throughout the state and around the world. We conduct groundbreaking research that makes a difference in people’s lives. And we produce graduates who are making a real difference — innovating, creating economic opportunity, and solving some of the most complex problems we face as a society. Georgia Tech today stands as one of the world’s great technological universities and as one of America’s leading public institutions. Our Progress and Service motto couldn’t be any more fitting.

&gt;As much as I have tried to prepare myself, I realize that there is much more I need to learn from you. I already have meetings scheduled with students, faculty, staff, and other stakeholders, and I know there will be many more. On Sept. 5 at 11 a.m. in the Ferst Center for the Arts, I will give my first Institute Address and will share my plans for the next few months. Among other things, I will announce a new strategic planning process during which we will have additional opportunities to engage in a dialogue about the future of Georgia Tech.

&gt;I am humbled to be following in the footsteps of great leaders who’ve steered us skillfully over the past decades. I am particularly thankful to my predecessor, Bud Peterson, for his extraordinary contributions to Georgia Tech and for all he’s done to facilitate our transition.

&gt;I owe much to Georgia Tech not only professionally but personally. Beth, who grew up in northern Alabama, and I, who grew up in Madrid, met at Tech during orientation, started dating a year later, got married before we graduated, and have been together since. We have lived and raised our family in Spain, Arizona, and Virginia. But we have kept coming back to Atlanta, a place we’ve always considered our shared hometown. We are excited beyond words to be back in this great city and at a school that, quite literally, changed our lives.

&gt;Thank you for the warm welcome and for all you do to make Georgia Tech what it is. I very much look forward to getting to know you and working with you.

post,"My Summer Spaceflight Fellowship Experience Meeting Elon Musk and Buzz Aldrin while working to provide global broadband internet coverage. (And how you can join the program next Summer!).  

TL:DR at the bottom!

Hey all! This past Summer I had the opportunity to take part in the Matthew Isakowitz Fellowship Program (MIFP) as part of the Fellow Class of 2019. As the application period for the Class of 2020 approaches in the next week or two, I thought I'd write down some of the highlights of my experience while also sharing application information with my fellow Yellow Jackets. If anything in this post piques your interest, please come to the [information session](https://ae.gatech.edu/event/info-session-brooke-owens-and-matthew-isakowitz-fellowship) on both the MIFP and the analogous Brooke Owens Fellowship Program on Friday 9/20 from 4-6pm in Guggenheim 442!

The Matt Fellowship is designed to inspire and grow the next generation of young men and women to be the future innovators, entrepreneurs, and leaders of the commercial space industry. As part of the program, fellows are matched with one of the host companies (SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, OneWeb) for a Summer internship, matched with executive mentor, and attend a 3-day summit in LA. The four main components of the MIFP are Internship, Mentorship, The Summit, and Networking. Through these four components, fellows are able to gain hand-on experience in the commercial space industry while becoming **extremely** well connected to major industry players.

**Internship:**

As part of the Fellowship I was placed in a paid internship with OneWeb Satellites in Cape Canaveral Florida. OWS is the 50/50 joint venture between Airbus and OneWeb with the primary goal of the company to manufacture, assemble and test OneWeb's telecommunication satellites. I got to work out of OWS' brand new Florida production facility that has the ability to produce 2 fully tested satellites every **8 hours** at approximately **2%** the cost of a traditional manufacturer. My work saw me working in a joint product evolution / business development role and allowed me to travel across the country to work with various hardware vendors and attend SmallSat in Logan, UT. I found the work extremely gratifying and got to learn from coworkers who are experts at their craft. Additionally, working within a stones-throw of the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex had its perks too. Getting to work at the Cape during the Summer of Apollo 11's 50th anniversary really brought things into perspective when watching various rocket launches and touring the different launch pads. (Watching the first night launch of the Falcon Heavy was such a treat!) Thankfully, OWS has allowed me to continue my work remotely part-time this Fall to support a few contracts so if you have any questions feel free to reach out!

**Mentorship:**

During last Spring I was matched with John Gedmark, CEO of Astranis as my executive mentor. John has provided me with a lot of vital guidance as I finish up my last semester here at Tech and is still in contact with me even after my Summer at OWS. His work to provide high-bandwidth satellite internet to Alaska complimented my work quite well and he was able to give me an intelligent perspective as to where he thinks the commercial space industry will grow in the years to come.

**Summit:**

During the last week of July, I had the pleasure of attending the MIFP Summit in LA. The summit gave me the opportunity to meet and fraternize with the other 24 fellows while touring various commercial space companies and playing some intense space trivia on the bus rides. I'll be honest, I was very nervous to meet the other fellows. The only information I had learned about them was from their LinkedIn pages, papers they had published or presentations they had given. The summit tore down all of these walls and within 72 hours I had gained 24 fast-friends who were all space-geeks like me. Over the course of the summit I had the opportunity to meet two of my idols; Elon Musk and Buzz Aldrin.... IN THE SAME DAY. In between two of our company tours (Virgin Orbit and Boeing), it was announced as a surprise that we would be taking a detour to SpaceX's Hawthorne headquarters to sit down with Elon for \~30min and ask him any questions we had about life, liberty and the pursuit of Mars colonization. He was a bit taller than I imagined and the best way I can describe the way he talked is if an overclocked CPU could be a human brain, it would be Elon Musk. He jumped from point to point in his answers and you could tell he was doing tons of 'back of the envelope' calculations for each thing he said. Here are some of my favorite quotes from our chat:

""Getting a PhD is like eating glass and staring into the abyss.""

""If you have enough patience to get a PhD, you probably have too much patience.""

That evening it was also announced as a surprise that the Buzz Aldrin would be attending the summit reception dinner as the guest of honor. As if meeting Elon wasn't enough, getting to meet Buzz and shake his hand just a few days after the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 sent me over the moon! (pun intended) Buzz was curt, no nonsense and straight to the point. We asked about the events that led to him becoming the second man on the Moon his response was very on character: ""Being in the right place at the right time... and a whole lot of bullshit!"" During the rest of the evening I met executives from almost all of the host companies as well as other prominent figures in the industry. I got to learn more about what they were up to currently as well as the steps they took out of school to get to where they are today. The summit finished with a closing ceremony and a wonderful opportunity to meet and mingle with fellows from the class of 2018. By the end of the night current and past fellows were playing cornhole and singing bad karaoke around a bonfire. What a weekend.

**Networking:**

The final component of the fellowship is networking and there certainly was no lack of this element. Being a part of the MIFP provides you with an **insane** network in the commercial space industry. I think that 2018 Matt fellow Sydney Dolan put it best. When asked about the networking benefits of the MIFP, she said ""It's probably how Peter Parker feels."" Joining this family is truly akin to gaining super powers. To give an example of the type of networking that I experienced during the program I only have to list the 4 non-fellow guests seated at my table during the summit reception dinner:

Peter Diamandis: Founder of the X-Prize

George Whitesides: CEO of Virgin Galactic

John Gedmark: CEO of Astranis

Tim Ellis: CEO of Relativity Space

Many of the Matt Fellows have gotten their first jobs out of college from the connections they made during the program. The MIFP gives you the power to seek out almost any team within any of the host companies and have a direct line to hiring managers and recruiters. All you need to do is ask and the community is almost always able to get you in contact with your desired party. IT'S CRAZY.

**How Can You Take Part?:**

As stated earlier, the application for the Matt Fellowship Class of 2020 will be opening in the next week or two. The requirements to apply are as follows:

* At the time of application, is a **college junior, college senior, or graduate student** who intends to pursue a **full-time career in the commercial spaceflight industry**. 
   * *Commercial space* is broadly defined as activities in entrepreneurship, intrapreneurship, and innovation that will enable new or dramatically improved products or services that do not depend solely on government cost-plus contracting to prove viable. In its most aspiring terms, commercial space promises to alter the space industry through new business models that will open up the space frontier.
* Has either earned an **engineering degree** or is working towards one at the time the Fellowship begins. 
* Has a diversity in experience and academic interests such as in engineering, science, management, business, and other related fields that can be related to commercial space. 
* Is a **U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident** (green card holder) due to export control regulations at the host companies.

Luckily for you, the Matt Fellows (and Brookies) will be hosting an info session to go over the MIFP and BOFP and application process for each program in more detail in a couple weeks. We can provide more insight on the type of applicants the programs take and what we found helpful during our application process. If you have any questions feel free to reach out and I hope to see a bunch of you on 9/20!

I'm part of the GT Filmmaking Club and am trying to find a place for us to shoot our short film for the upcoming Campus Movie Fest. The setting of our film is a laboratory, so we'd like to use one of the many on/near Tech's campus.

I assume I'm going to have to get in contact with whoever is in charge of a given lab, but I have no clue where to find that sort of information and Googling has been fruitless (so far). 

We'd ideally like to be filming in Klaus or another CS building, but beggars can't be choosers so I'll take what I can get. We can only film on Friday and Saturday (6th and 7th) according to the festival guidelines, so hopefully that won't be an issue.

In the recent weeks, we have heard student feedback and frustration about the change in frequency of the Community Market, formerly known as the Farmer’s Market. As your Student Government, it is our duty to represent your opinion-- the students’ opinion-- to the fullest extent, and we will continue to communicate to you any updates we receive throughout the process and conversations around the Community Market. 

When we asked Auxiliary Services about the new Community Market schedule, they emphasized that their goal in changing the schedule is to prioritize service quality as well as a greater variety in what the vendors offer. Their hope is to continue to offer good, diverse options on a frequent basis. 

We value the tradition and history the Community Market has on our campus, and we are working to ensure the Market picks back up as soon as it can. In response to food trucks on campus, they will return next week. They typically have returned to campus the week after Labor Day. 

In sum, we hear you, we understand your frustration, and we are with you. Conversations have already begun with Georgia Tech Auxiliary Services, and they will continue to happen.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



Let  me first thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with me  in regards to the Community Market. I assure you your concerns have been  heard. I also want to apologize for not replying directly to each of you, but the sheer volume of emails I  received made that a formidable task. I want to first say the Community  Market is not going away. Due to organizational changes, my office was  asked to take on oversight of the Community Market. As we took on this program we recognized some exciting areas  opportunities for the market, but realized we could not achieve them  alone. 

The  first thing we did was establish a steering committee to help  coordinate the logistical and programmatic components of the market. The  group consists of students, faculty, and staff who are invested in and want to create a thriving market. As with many new  initiatives, we’ll need time to fine turn things. To ensure a successful  and sustainable launch, it was decided that during the initial months  of the Community Market we would operate on a monthly schedule and then consider adding additional dates. 

We  wanted to make sure the market met the needs of the Tech community, not  only this year but moving forward. We also wanted to better incorporate  locally sourced and sustainable options into the market in the form of fresh fruits and vegetables and reduce  duplication amongst vendors. To do this, we looked closely at the food  and retail options provided and decided to only include those vendors  who we believed offered a unique option not already available on campus or available at other locations in the Atlanta area.  Upon initial review, an invitation was not extended to Marrakech  Express; however, based on the outpouring of support for Marrakech  Express the steering committee will consider extending an invitation to the vendor. 

I  want to assure you we have Tech’s best interest at heart and many people  on the steering committee share your passion for the Community Market  and would to like to see it occur more frequently. These changes are being implemented to ensure greater return on  investment for all vendors, increased anticipation and participation in  the market and to allow the steering committee time to develop and  implement new programmatic features into the market. We’ll also be conducting surveys at the markets to gain valuable feedback from  the Tech community. We have identified two dates thus far, Wednesday,  Sept 25 and Wednesday, Oct 30, and will be adding a date in November. We  hope that we can add additional dates during the spring semester and expand the market in the coming years.

Marcus

post,"Looking for a photographer willing to take a cosplay photoshoot. Hiyo! I enjoy cosplaying a lot and plan to see myself competing in many competitions and conventions in the area. I'm a freshman CompE major. Most of my cosplay revolves around armor and weapons, as well as other props. However, I didn't have much room in my car to bring much cosplay, so now I'm excited to build a whole new collection here at GA Tech.

The year-long project I'm currently working on is Bondrewd, the Lord of Dawn from the popular anime and manga, Made in Abyss. It's even my first time using 3D printers instead of Pepakura, which is like a kind of origami printing thing. I've even been printing 2 12 hour prints each weekday between the Invention Studio and the HIVE, mainly in preparation for the upcoming Anime Weekend Atlanta. 

However, I've run into quite a problem. I suck at taking photos, and I don't own any fancy cameras. I would like to run several photoshoots throughout the year to detail the progress I make in the cosplay (cuz it's going to evolve). I might even be able to pay (depends on the circumstances).

post,"What GT does when you have a mental breakdown.. First off, I don’t want to scare anyone away from help.  Get help, but avoid campus resources for now.  You do not want them involved in your mental health;  find a private counselor, a good friend, a professor, or if you’re feeling worse than all of that:  Take an Uber to the hospital (PM me and I’ll even pay for the uber)

That having been said, here’s what you can expect if you let GT get involved:

In early spring ‘18, I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and I called the “counselor on call” at Georgia Tech.  I told them my situation and they *offered* a ride to Ridgeview institute.  I accepted, as an uber would have been expensive.  I could have said no and went home, meaning I was not an involuntary transport.  GTPD was chill and understanding, and we had good conversation on the way over.  But my mistake was that the GT bureaucracy was now involved.

My time at ridgeview was acceptable, and is not my main concern.  I worked honestly and exerted  effort with professionals I felt could make my mental health improve.  I was discharged 5 days later.  In my discharge paper, there was an exclusionary option for release of records; I filled it in with a few substances I was or had been on.  I signed the records to be sent to the GT counseling department, because I was told they’d want to do their own evaluation.

Upon my return, I was mandated to return to the dean of students before I could even attend class or return to a dorm.  Even before I could see the counselor I was required to see.  I set a meeting and the next day I arrived and she had in front of her my entire discharge manual.  This person, who had no medical or counselor training had my blood pressure, medicines, therapy notes, dietary observations, *and* the list of drugs I specifically prohibited to be on *ANY* discharge paper.

Her first words were “you need to get off of the xxxxx if you want to stay here.”  No “glad you’re better” “I hope you’re Ok.”

She asked me if I considered a retroactive withdrawal (withdrawing unconditionally from all classes for the semester), but I had professors who were willing to work with me over the coming summer to clean up the work I had missed.

I still don’t know where my discharge records are.  I missed the 180 day deadline to file a complaint to the HIPPA officials, so I guess I’ll never know.

tl;dr needed help, contacted GT, took their advice, got better, signed exclusionary discharge forms to counselors office, entire booklet ends up at dean of students’.",Negative,Mental health resources at Georgia Tech.,368,2019-09-13,"mental health, resources, georgia tech, support, assistance, counseling, treatment, campus, bureaucracy, discharge, records, dean, students"

If you're like me and moved out of The Standard on July 31st, you recently received your security deposit via mail. Mine is postmarked September 10th. The Standard was obligated by Georgia law to return your deposit (or at least have it in the mail) within 30 days of move out. Failure for them to do so entitles the tenant to up to 3 times the security deposit amount.

This may seem like a small amount of money, or a small error on their part, but The Standard has consistently taken advantage of Tech students, and its really not cool. Enough of us making legal claims will put a well-deserved burden on them.

Bringing them to small claims court definitely takes time, and you might not deem all that time worth it for your potential (not guaranteed) ~$150 profit, but I'm just letting everyone know that it is an option. Also, I have heard that international students had a much larger deposit, so it would definitely be worth your time if your deposit was like $500 compared to my measly $100 deposit.

What self-proclaimed yellow jacket fan would want third down in Bobby Dodd to be quieter? I don’t even care about Money Down or whatever they play on the loudspeakers, MONEY DOWN AND THIRD DOWN CHORDS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. That you have a volunteer organization of the loudest and biggest Georgia Tech fans in a prime section of the stadium, and then tell them to be quiet when the opposing offense converts third down after third down is idiotic. 


Having the band play chords on defensive third downs is what gets the fans in the entire stadium loud as well. When you have the people who practice hours every week to be as loud as they can silenced on GAMEDAY, you lose half of the volume and 100% of the atmosphere of college football in Bobby Dodd Stadium. Georgia Tech Fans were louder and more excited at the away game in Clemson (where we lost worse than the spread) than they have been for the past two HOME games. I was there for both, and the biggest reason why is because the band could play as loud as they wanted at an away game and can’t in their own stadium.


If you don’t want to hear the band support the atmosphere of college football at your home games, then you might as well stop funding them all together and replace them with the PA system. Go ahead and see if that will fill your North Stands when the football team loses to Citadel. If you’re going to fund a band, let them play often and loud. 


Third down chords are one of the band’s greatest traditions, and we better start recognizing what we had before it’s gone.

post,"To all e-scooter riders: wear a fucking helmet.. I just took a super nasty fall off of a Bird behind the MRDC. The slabs of concrete aren't level, and a bump I've hit a dozen times before sent me flying. Bird went one direction, I went another. My knees are scrapped the hell up, my left elbow is a bloody disaster, and my chin is a mess. As far as I can tell, nothing is broken, but there is some sharp occasional pain in my left arm and leg. Health Center patched me up and sent me on my way, telling me to come back in the morning if anything got worse.

And ya know what? It would have been a thousand times worse if I hadn't had my helmet on. There's a huge scrape across the front lip that would have been my forehead smacking dead into pavement at 15 miles an hour. At the absolute very least it would mean that my face would have gotten even more messed up, but it likely would have been a concussion or broken skull.

Literally on the way back to my dorm, I stopped a scooter rider who was heading downhill straight for an even worse bump that he apparently didn't notice. And guess what? He didn't have a helmet.

post,"Unpopular Opinion: You should not be allowed to be a TA if you can barely speak English. I have a feeling this is going to be unpopular for not being “inclusive” so I decided to make an alt for this one.

I think that the most basic TA requirement is that you should be able to understand/speak English well. I’m tired of being in a lab and having to ask the same question 8 times to get an answer because the TA can’t understand what I’m saying.  It wastes tons of time and I end up getting the wrong information from the TA all the time since they will just guess what I am asking and provide a response. On a lab that takes the entire 2:45 class, time is precious.

Also, even if they do understand what I am saying, half of the time understanding their response is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. Yes they are technically answering the question, but I have to uncomfortably ask them to repeat themselves several times (which visually annoys them) because whatever they said was only half English under a very thick accent.

All prospective TAs should sit down with someone and not be allowed to if their accent is too thick to be understood, they can hardly understand English, or they can’t provide clear responses in English.

I know I am not the only one who has had this frustration in many classes.  I’m aware that we have a lot of international graduate and undergrad students who are extremely capable people way smarter than myself, I just don’t thing those who just barely speak English should be allowed to TA for the betterment of all other students.

post,"[Cybersecurity] Targeted Gift Card Scam. Hello everyone,

We wanted to let you know about an ongoing phishing scam that has been targeting faculty, students and staff on campus in order to social engineer them into purchasing gift cards. 

This is a scam we have seen before but it has become more prevalent over the past two weeks. The sender asks if you are ""available"" and will ask you to send large amounts of money in gift cards. Sometimes if you respond and question their legitimacy they will respond with something akin to, ""I have to go now, there is a meeting really soon. Please have this completed as soon as possible"" to instill a sense of urgency from the recipient.   
Many of these phishing emails will also pose as an authority figure or someone you may know. We advise that you be wary of receiving an email like this, as Bud Peterson is NOT going to ask you to send $400 worth of Steam gift cards.

Here are some ways to tell if an email is fishy:  
1. Impersonating a Gatech email in a way similar to \[username\].gatech@gmail.com  
2. A short message requesting other contact information (phone numbers, other email addresses, etc)  
3. Trying to escalate to requesting gift cards or other transferable funds  
4. Poor grammar or spelling  
5. Perceived sense of urgency (Urgent!)

We have a website, [phishbowl.gatech.edu](http://phishbowl.gatech.edu/), that contains a list of recently analyzed emails that were reported to us here at GT Cyber Security. On this website, we list whether or not these reported emails are legitimate.  
If you do not see your suspicious email on this website, please forward it as an attachment to [phishing@gatech.edu](mailto:phishing@gatech.edu).

post,"Should I drop game studies?. So I took this class as a means to finally decide my threads between games or UX design (CM Major). i’ve always loved playing games so why not learn how to make them. through the first week I felt kinda meh but still felt worth it to try. Second week I learn that the prof (a grad student) grades strangely harshly on the assignments even though this is an intro class and barely the second week. I started off with a C because he felt like I could have “explained more” on a short assignment when I followed the instrument he posted exactly. that’s fine cool i’ll just try harder on the following assignments. we had a partner project that I ended up doing ALL. BY. MYSELF. b/c my partner never answered my questions of ideas or which parts to split. that’s fine it’s ok as long as we were not in the same group again. Then here comes today. on tuesdays we usually have a programming assignment in c# due by 11:59pm and it’s paired with a youtube tutorial on what the hw is about. Not only was the video barely helpful with anything but the assignment was a freakishly big jump from our last assignment. note that I would like to say I usually start these assignments day of and finish within an hour or 2. but this shit was impossible even for Google.
So here I am, tired, angry, and definitely wanting to steer clear of game studies.

Anyway, I’ve come to terms that I may not be as rich as I wanted to be as a kid. I’ve decided that success to me is 50% financial stability and 50% genuine happiness and contentment with life. I am struggling still with the idea that I may not be as well off after college as I wanted to be when I was younger.
One thing I am nervous about though, is disappointing my parents. They literally worked and sacrificed so much for me to be able to go to college (I am a first gen)

post,"Aerospace Vs. Computer Engineering ??. I'm interested in electronics, etc. and my final goal is to work in the space industry. Avionics looks like the perfect career path, but I'm honestly not sure how to get there. I'm currently a freshman in AE and considering switching to CompE with a minor in AE next semester because from what I researched online, more CompEs or EEs work with satellites and flight systems.

I talked to recruiters at the career fair, and some people said if I balanced out AE with research in EE, or did CS or CompE with research in AE it would be a fine combination. I also like the fact that CompE's have a wider job scope/opportunities than AEs.

Problems:

\- I haven't taken a single AE class yet, so I haven't had the chance to see if I even like or don't like AE classes yet (thanks FASET 7). I do know I kind of like working with computers/electronics/a little bit of programming.

\- I'm worried as a CompE I won't get as much exposure to the space industry, or space-related research opportunities

\- Also still not 100% sure if CompE will qualify me to work on satellites or spacecrafts or rovers and stuff

I've been super split about this, so any advice is appreciated.

post,"PSA: Rules of the Road on North Avenue Crosswalk. Today was an interesting morning where I almost (EDIT to clarify: accidentally) took out a scooter driver at the pedestrian crosswalk across North Avenue. I know this gets posted all the time, but let’s review what those lights mean for drivers on North Avenue:

FLASHING YELLOW = Proceed with caution, the pedestrian crosswalk will be activated soon.

SOLID YELLOW = Prepare to stop, the light is about to go solid red.

SOLID RED = Stop. You may not proceed, even if the crosswalk is clear. This is a red light like any other.

FLASHING RED = Stop. You may proceed if the crosswalk is clear but must stop for pedestrians. This is a stop sign, like any other flashing red light.

So let’s sum it up: if I stop for the crosswalk and wait for it to go flashing red and your little scooter decides to dart across the crosswalk and I hit you, you are 100% at fault. Scooters are not pedestrians and CANNOT use that crosswalk unless they dismount.

If you want to try to lecture me on your scooter about how I should have stopped (which I had), then try learning and obeying the road laws yourself.",Neutral,Road safety and crosswalk rules.,94,2019-09-18,"safety, crosswalks, rules, traffic, pedestrians, drivers, scooters, laws"

Glad to know that I'm paying 800$ to pay this extra 50$, and I'm sure a few more to come.

Now, I understand the point. Help facilitate actual learning, force us to go over what we've missed. But damn it, we've already been examined, and the final exam will force us to go over it again. To me this is just needlessly stressful. Because of small errors, this is the first test in 3 years at tech that I've legitimately failed.

post,"The ""Visiting every building on campus"" challenge.. Greetings /r/gatech,

I'm a [bored](https://xkcd.com/267/) CS student, and I like to explore. I also want to meet new people outside my major. It seems a little sad that even though I've been here for a year already I've only really been to a few places on campus. While my life is centered around Klaus and CCB, I've never been in any of the bio quad buildings, for example!

Therefore, I decided to make it a challenge to visit every building on campus at least once before I graduate. But I also think it's not very interesting if I simply just go to a building and walk around aimlessly. So it would be better if I had someone who was familiar with the place to show me around and point out anything interesting or cool that people outside your major might not be aware of. It also seems like a fun way to learn and share what cool stuff we have on campus that not many people know about.

That's where you can help! If you're a different major, I would love to meet up sometime, hang out, and explore any of the places that you go every day. The places that are mundane to you are new and exciting to me! If I piqued your interest, please send me a PM. Or send it to your friends. Thanks for reading my post! :D

**List of places I'm already familiar with**:

* Klaus
* CCB
* CODA
* The Hive / IDC

**Cool-looking places I want to see:**

* [~~Nanotechnology building~~](https://cleanroom.gatech.edu/content/Capabilities) ~~(isn't there like a die fab here?!?!?!)~~ Visited!! And there *IS* really cool equipment!
* Petit building (What's with the clean room in the basement!!!)
* Caddell building (it looks cool from the outside. but I don't know what they do)
* Bio Quad: Petit biotech, Whitaker, Ford, Molecular Sci.&amp;Eng. (these buildings look super fancy, I wonder what cool stuff is inside.)
* Krone (This building has really cool architecture and I keep seeing busy-looking grad students come out of here. But I don't know what it is they research)
* [Manufacturing quad](https://mill.mse.gatech.edu/): Love, Manufacturing research center, Manufacturing complex (there's an electron microscope!!!!)
* ~~Architecture (there's pretty art inside.)~~ Saw it!! And learned about their major.
* Scheller (looks really fancy)
* ~~Howey, Mason (maybe cool physics stuff here?)~~ Visited! Saw Jupiter and Saturn through the telescope for the first time in my life :)
* Skiles (I've been here, but surely a math major knows more than me.)
* Coon, Weber (Maybe cool space stuff here??)
* Guggenheim, Knight, and Eng Sci &amp; Mech. (Maybe cool aerospace or ME stuff here?)
* Van Leer (Isn't there a huge radio tower on the roof?)
* Boggs, Burger-Henry and Allen, Cherry Emerson, Savant, Swann (I keep walking past these places but don't know what they even are for)
* Anywhere else you think is interesting! Your dorm, your fraternity, your research lab, where you work, etc!

Edit: wow, I didn't expect to get such a positive response. People already messaged me about Howey and Marcus. Would love to see more!

post,"W's Effect on PhD Admissions?. Hey guys! So in the Spring, I took a W in a class that's somewhat related to my major, but not a requirement. I originally took the class since it was a prerequisite for a major I was originally thinking of switching into. I was doing well in the class, but I realized I wasn't really interested in the subject and wanted to focus on my newfound passion for my original major. Fast forward seven months and I'm thinking of dropping another class this semester that's completely unrelated to my major. Due to scheduling conflict in Phase II, I didn't end up with all the classes I wanted and had to take a humanities course that I expected to be not too difficult and somewhat fun. However, two weeks into the class I realized it has a very heavy workload (essays every week - I didn't know about this until the second week since I wasn't even registered for the class on syllabus day) and the subject is so boring to the point that I fall asleep every other class. I would much rather spend my time with major classes, research, or just getting exercise hours in.

Problem is it's always a dream of mine to be a professor and going into academia. How much will PhD programs here at Tech (or similar schools) care if I have these two W's on my transcript? I've been reading posts about this and I'm getting mixed results; some say they won't care at all and others say it may hurt. I know graduate schools care more about experience, recommendation letters, GPA, and GRE, but it seems like with the exception of a high GPA, I don't have a particularly strong application compared with other students here. Will having two W's hurt my chances even more in this case and destroy my dreams? Any input is much appreciated, thanks in advance!",Neutral,PhD admissions and the potential impact of receiving two W's in unrelated classes on future academic goals.,6,2019-09-20,"phd admissions, academic goals, w's, unrelated classes, impact, future, academia, graduate school, experience, recommendation letters, gpa, gre, strong application, chances, dreams, input."

Pretty much every CS major knows that they need ""a good GitHub"" to be competitive in the job market, but I've realized that not as many people actually work on open source projects, or even know where to start. I was definitely there a year ago, and I've spent 2019 getting deeper into open source, and would love to have a place to share this really awesome aspect of the software world with others! As far as structure goes, we'd probably have some open coding times weekly/biweekly for people to work on their projects, and maybe host a technical talk every month or so covering some aspect of open source software, either from a student or a local professional.

What do y'all think? Any takers?

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 6 of 12

28. Schultz’s appearance corresponded to the description he provided to the 911 dispatcher – he was a white male with long blonde hair dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans.

29. Each of the officers saw that Schultz was walking slowly. 30. Each of the officers saw that Schultz was alone.  
31. Each of the officers saw that Schultz’ arms were at his side. 32. Officers drew their handguns and pointed them at Schultz. 33. Schultz was barefoot.

34. Schultz was verbally calm.  
35. Schultz did not state any threat to either of the officers.  
36. Schultz did not move his arms in a violent or aggressive manner. 37. One officer shouted at Schultz, “Speak.”  
38. Schultz did not immediately respond.  
39. One officer yelled at Schultz, asking for his name,  
40. Schultz did not immediately respond.  
41. Each of the officers was twenty or more feet in distance from

Schultz’s position. As Schultz moved slowly, officers adjusted their position to keep a safe distance from Schultz.

42. Schultz paused and turned the position of his body so that he was facing several of the officers.

6

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 7 of 12

43. Schultz slowly walked a few steps in the direction of the three officers.

44. One of the three officers told Schultz not to move.

45. At the time that he was told not to move, Schultz’ arms remained at his side.

46. At the time that he was told not to move, Schultz was facing in the direction of the three officers.

47. Each of the officers observed that Schultz was not acting rationally and was not responding rationally to officer commands.

48. Schultz’s actions as of the time that he was told not to move were consistent with a person who is experiencing a mental health crisis and were actions which a reasonably trained law enforcement officer would recognize as such.

49. One or more of the four officers had received training designed to equip police officers with the observational skills to judge when a subject whom they are confronting is undergoing a mental health crisis or is otherwise engaging in behavior reflective of mental illness.

50. The specialized training, Crisis Intervention Techniques, trains an officer in methods to de-escalate a potentially dangerous situation when

7

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 8 of 12

dealing with a person undergoing a mental health crisis or engaging in behavior reflective of mental illness.

51. Officer Beck was not one of those officers.

52. Several of the officers at the scene remained calm and followed standard de-escalation techniques without initiating physical force directed at Scott Schultz.

53. Unlike the other officers, Officer Beck did not de-escalate and instead used physical force.

54. Immediately after Schultz was told not to move by one of his fellow officers, Beck shot Schultz – firing his weapon one time.

55. Beck was the only officer to fire his weapon at Schultz.

56. At the time that Beck fired his weapon, Schultz had taken no physical or verbal action which constituted a threat to the physical safety of Beck or the other officers.

57. At the time that Beck fired his weapon, Schultz had taken no physical or verbal action which constituted a threat to the physical safety of another person.

58. At the time that Beck fired his weapon, according to news reporting at the time, the majority of Georgia Tech’s police officers had not completed the Crisis Intervention training.

8

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 9 of 12

59. The steps taken by Georgia Tech to train its officers in Crisis Intervention Techniques were clearly insufficient to prevent Schultz’s death.

60. The failure to properly train its police officers in Crisis Intervention Techniques was the result of inaction and decisional failures which occurred well in advance of Schultz’ death.

61. The need for such training was well known within the law enforcement community.

62. Studies published years in advance of Schultz’s death estimated that “at least half” of all fatal police encounters involve persons with psychiatric disorders. Kelley Bouchard, “*Across Nation, Unsettling Acceptance When Mentally Ill in Crisis are Killed*,” Portland Press Herald, Dec. 9, 2012.

63. Once he was shot, Schultz did not die immediately.

64. Schultz endured pain and emotional harm in anticipation of his own death.

65. The death certificate declared, correctly, that Schultz’s death was caused by a gunshot wound to his torso.

66. Schultz was pronounced dead just after midnight on the morning of September 17, 2017.

9

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 10 of 12

67. Schultz’s death was the result of Georgia Tech’s and the State of Georgia’s failure over time to properly train their personnel to act in such a way as to prevent the exclusion of persons such as Scott Schultz from the safety to which all students were entitled on the campus of Georgia Tech.

68. As of the preparation of this Complaint, Plaintiffs have, through their counsel, repeatedly sought, without success, to obtain the investiga- tive records of Georgia Tech, of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, of the City of Atlanta, and the Office of the District Attorney of Fulton County, Georgia. The records sought include, but are not limited to, witness statements, photographic and auditory recordings, still photos, ballistics evidence, and physical evidence. None of those records have been produced.

69. As a result of the denial of access to the information contained within those files, Plaintiffs anticipate that an Amendment to this Complaint may be appropriate in the future.

CAUSES OF ACTION  
70. The actions of Tyler Austin Beck violated the constitutional right

of Scott Schultz to be free from unreasonable seizures as established by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Beck’s actions not only caused physical harm to Scott Schultz, they killed him.

10

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 11 of 12

71. The Board Of Regents Of The University System Of Georgia By And On Behalf Of Georgia Institute Of Technology is and has been at all relevant times the recipient of federal financial assistance. Part of that financial assistance has been used to fund the operations, construction and/or maintenance of Georgia Tech. By its actions or inactions, Georgia Tech denied Scott Schultz the equal access to the benefit of its services, programs or activities in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794 and the regulations promulgated thereto and in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and such denial is actionable through Title II of said Act.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF  
For and upon the foregoing, Plaintiffs pray that this Court:

a. Afford them a trial by jury as to all claims and issues for which a jury is available.

b. Award them all damages available to the Estate of Scott Schultz which are permitted by the laws of the State of Georgia and the laws of the United States – damages from each of the Defendants.

11

Case 1:19-cv-04083-JPB Document 1 Filed 09/11/19 Page 12 of 12

c. Award William Schultz and Lynne Schultz all damages which are available as a result of Scott Schultz’s wrongful death – damages from each of the Defendants.

d. Award the Plaintiffs such costs and attorneys’ fees as are available by operation of the laws of the State of Georgia and of the United States.

So submitted on this the 11th day of September, 2019.

post,"In memoriam: James Strock. Dear Students, Faculty and Staff:

I want to bring you an update to last night’s message. It is with a heavy heart that I share with you that James Strock, a second-year student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, passed away after a swimming accident yesterday.

James, who was originally from Uganda, moved to the United States at age 16. He worked hard to adapt and excelled academically, according to his parents. James was a computer engineering major and an active member of our campus community. He was an avid user of the Campus Recreational Center and attended campus ministry. He completed a co-op program with DataPath in Lawrenceville this past summer.

On behalf of Georgia Tech, we offer our deepest condolences to James’ family and friends during this difficult time. I have been in constant contact with his family and will continue to be there to support them.

This is a tragic loss, and I urge you take advantage of the counseling services that are available on campus. Grief counseling is available through the Counseling Center (counseling.gatech.edu) in the Student Services (Flag) Building from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. throughout the week and after-hours by calling 404-894-2575. Staff and faculty may find support through the Employee Assistance Program at hwb.gatech.edu/eap.

post,"ME classes on the side as an ID major?. I'm currently an undergrad studying Industrial Design, but Tech has some of the best engineering programs in the country. I love ID and I would never change my major, but I would like to know if it would be worthwhile to learn some engineering on the side. I have some open credits in my last three semesters. Are there any ME classes that would potentially help me in the future (i.e. in communicating with engineers, design for manufacturing/assembly, a better understanding of technology/innovation, etc.), or would focusing on ID be more beneficial? I'm potentially interested in innovative design along the likes of Dyson, both design and mechanical-tech heavy. Tech does not offer an ME minor; the closest would be AE, Physics, or Robotics. But would taking some classes potentially help me enter a more tech heavy field while job searching?

post,"Come Shoot with the Marksmanship Club!. Hello Everyone!

We will be holding a pistol fundamentals workshop on **Saturday, September 28th. We will be meeting at the Student Center Parking Lot at 11:30 AM. We will be leaving the parking lot promptly at 12:00 PM.** It is a ~40 minute trip from Georgia Tech to our shooting range, and we typically shoot for 2-2.5 hours; we will most likely  be back on campus around 4:30 PM.

This workshop will be most useful to people who are novice/beginner pistol shooters or who want to learn/reinforce  the many fundamentals of pistol shooting in a small group, hands-on, range environment. The workshop will focus on fundamentals, with a good amount of dry fire practice before doing live fire with rimfire and centerfire handguns. **In order to make sure all participants receive focused instruction, we will be limiting this this outing to 7 people only.** We will be holding additional instructional outings throughout the semester, if you signed up for this outing but were not selected you will get top priority for the next one.

This class WON'T cover more complex topics such as drawing from holster, fast mag changes, etc. **The end goal of this class is for you to be able to effectively put rounds on target during slow fire, with a decent grouping.**

If you need a centerfire gun, we can loan you a gun to train on (indicate caliber preference in the Google Form, subject to availability).

If you have one, you should bring your own centerfire pistol and magazines (and a rimfire if you would like, please let us know). In any case, we will provide the ammo (common service calibers including: 9mm, .40, and .45).

post,"Tired, unmotivated, and in need of advice. Hi, I'm a first year HTS student. Aside from that, I've had an ongoing issue of being unmotivated and finding or doing schoolwork or studying pointless. I can even remember doing this in elementary school with the easiest of projects, and procrastinating on a small 3 sentence summary on a book chapter until the day it was due. I just didn't see why I should care other than needing to get good grades to eventually make good money. I am relatively smart. When I study, I usually understand things pretty easily. But, for years I have only really joined harder programs and courses or pushed myself to be academically ""successful"" or try to be the top percent in anything I do because I feel that if I don't I'm a failure. I don't know what I want to do and feel lost. I feel like if I don't find a career I want to go towards soon, I will have no opportunity to feel motivated based off of enjoying my future. I'm afraid that I will continue to live like this, working hard to be the best or trying to survive vs doing it because I like it. I have learned to be a Jack of all trades, but lover of none. Even when I do find something I might enjoy, I think to myself ""can I actually make money off of this? Will I be struggling financially like my parents and the people around me forever?"" I can most definitely blame this stupid school system in the US and that's likely found globally, but I think it's best to conform for now as I always have. I just want to know for sure that I'll have stability, but that desire for stability and success is being driven without an actual road to drive on. I've been free falling off a cliff with no bottom I feel like for years now. No, I'm not suicidal. I'm stuck in that annoying ""I don't want to be here in this state anymore, but I don't want to die either"". I just want to be a better me at least if I can't find a better setting. I should just go see my therapist again. I feel like I'll soon relapse into that state of utter uck. I just want a sense of direction and motivation. What should I do?

TLDR What can I do to stop being a lazy mofo and achieve a sense of direction and motivation to do my work and figure out what to do with my life?

post,"Officer Issuing Tickets to Bikes Running Stop Signs. Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

So within Georgia bikes must follow all traffic laws, such as not riding on the side walk, yielding to pedestrians, and stopping at stop signs. Recently I was issued a traffic violation for running a stop sign by Officer T. Foster for running a stop sign. This happened at the intersection of Ferst and Hemphill about 1 week ago. I fully admit that I broke the law, and now I will have to pay a fine, which I have no issue with. 

As a result I have now been much more careful with how I ride my bike and have done my best to follow traffic laws at all times when ridding my bike. I have also noticed Officer T. Foster has been regularly patrolling the intersection at Hemphill and Ferst as well as the intersection at State and Ferst (Right in front of the new Kendeda Building) and I have seen him stop bikers other than myself on two separate occasions. I don't know if I just wasn't aware of it before, but GTPD seems to be cracking down more of bikers this year especially, so I encourage all of you to be safe while you are riding and follow all traffic laws.

Here are some *basic things* you should always check first:

1. **Proper English Grammar** (punctuation and flow of sentences, English is usually not the scammers 1st language)
2. Does it seem **they are in a hurry**? (Are they out of the country traveling / in meetings and can't answer the phone)
3. **High Pay for little work** ($25/hr to Shop, Pay Bills, Placing and Expediting orders, scheduling meetings)
4. The email is **asking for your personal information** (Full name, Exact / Billing Address, Phone Number, Age, Occupation)
5. Always **check the signature** of the email (Scammers will use past/ recent employees of the company, check their LinkedIn)
6. **Check their email address** (if the email is coming from a GMAIL address, it is most likely a SCAM, real companies would send you an email from their own domain)
7. **Check the links** in the email (If the email address domain is different from the website domain; ex: extra letters)
8. Does the sender claim that this job is **EASY / LEGAL / VERY ATTRACTIVE**
9. The **pay will be in form of a CHECK** This is the whole point of the post, scammers will send you an EXTRA amount of money in the check saying that they made a mistake, requesting you send the remainder of the money back. After you send that money the original check will BOUNCE which means you won't have that money any longer as well as have lost the money you send them.
10. Know your capabilities / skills; ***verify that you actually did apply to that job*** on whatever website they're claiming they found you on.

After class, I walk back to my vehicle in a parking deck to find this on my windshield with some things in it that I can only presume to be potential Gatech students that are now lost. This was Parking Deck 5 between the 3rd and Fourth Floor Parking Ramp. I can only assume this had to be another student since I doubt a random individual could be walking around until he got to the Fourth and Third Floor, deciding to choose my vehicle to deface. However,  I can always be wrong as life can be interesting. The only thing I can see for me getting this on my vehicle is due to my bad parking which was done with two vehicles already in between the space that I chose and still with that, it was not as if my tire or vehicle was in a space for someone to park, making it impossible for someone to turn in or back up from the spaces from my left or right This only affected the space between two parking spots which if you have parked in the Visitor Parking Deck, still allows for someone to back up and even turn in if someone messes up and gets a tire in that space.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that I can say is that I am at least not angry since I have too many things to worry about anyway and therefore no time to get too bothered by this. I have still reported this to Gatech PD since I do not want this to become a thing that is allowed for others to do just because they get angry about bad parking(which in this case, I still don't see how it could have affected them) or even deface a vehicle for any other reason.

#####Community (Farmer's) Market Updates 

In response to the most recent developments with the Community Market, we want to be honest and transparent with you, and we also want to provide you with accurate information directly from those involved. 

Here is an update we received today from Georgia Tech’s Auxiliary Services: 

“Campus Services is committed to offering a quality community market, in conjunction with student needs and institute sustainability goals. While the market was originally scheduled for today, it has been rescheduled for a few reasons:

During the Spring 2019 semester, the Health Department raised concerns with the type of permits that were required for market vendors to operate on campus. This caused Campus Services to temporarily suspend market operations in order to review our processes and procedures, as well as legal requirements, to ensure the Institute is fully compliant. This review is not yet complete, so the Market scheduled for Sept. 25th has been postponed to Oct. 9th.

A steering committee has been created to guide the market and focus its direction. The committee is comprised of several stakeholders including GT Sustainability, SGA, the Student Center, Auxiliary Services, Health Initiatives and GT Dining. The committee has decided to align the market with Institute sustainability goals and broaden its scope to include local farmers in addition to merchant vendors as well as participation from GT sustainability groups.""

A survey has been created to generate feedback on what the community would like to see in the Market. The results of this survey will help the steering committee choose applicable vendors for future markets and mold the future of the program.

post,"Math Placement for Business Majors. Hello fellow yellow jackets :)

I am a first year ie major who has come to the realization that more intense math and science classes are not really for me. (Physics hit me like a ton of bricks and then ran me over hahaha) For this reason, i've decided to become a helluva business major. The only thing is that you can't be a helluva business major without taking a helluva lot of classes, and I need ya'lls help to make sure I'm, in the right ones!

Ok so basically, I have Calc AB credit (1551). I understand that there are two tracks you can go on: the 1500's track, and the 1700's track. 

To my knowledge, the 4 hour 1711 class covers the 2 hour 1551 material as well as 2 hour 1553 stuff (lin alg). Since i have 1551 credit, I am in a place where I can take  2 hour 1553 and fulfill that requirement, but since math is not my strong suit, would it be beneficial to take the full 1711 class at the expense of my hope/zell attempted hours? I am coming in with a ton of credit already, so I do have wiggle room.

If I take 1553, would I then have to take 1552, or can I do 1712 to fill that requirement.

Are the 17xx's classes significantly easier than the 15xx's ones, or am I in for it with whatever I pick?

Thank yall for helping with all my confusion!!","Positive

This morning, the NCAA Committee on Infractions issued its report regarding violations that took place in the Georgia Tech men’s basketball program in 2016-2017.  As president and as an alumnus I am deeply disappointed by these violations, which are inconsistent with our values and our legacy of principled competition in intercollegiate athletics. I am encouraged that our athletics department leadership took immediate action once the violations came to light. It must be an institutional priority to ensure this type of conduct never occurs again at Georgia Tech.

I am struck by the severity of the penalties imposed by the NCAA and the impact some of them will have on student athletes who had nothing to do with the violations. While I respect the Committee’s work on this case, we are exploring our options as to whether to appeal some aspects of the decision.

Regardless of the outcomes of this process, we are committed to maintaining the highest level of ethical standards in Athletics and across the Institute. I know Todd Stansbury, Georgia Tech’s Athletic Director and a fellow alumnus, feels as strongly as I do.

I am a high school senior applying for early decision at GA Tech, and I was wondering how you guys felt my chances were. My parents said that I would not stand a chance in the early decision pool--I agree (worth the shot though, right?). My friends that are applying have done a lot better than me. For example, one has a 34 superscore, another one has a 1480 SAT Score (also a semifinalist for National Merit Scholarship), and the other has a 36 composite (naisu). Be as blunt as possible so I can get a real assessment of my chances. If you have any tips on Common App essays for tech that would also be greatly appreciated. 

A bit about me:

I am salutatorian (was valedictorian until this year came around)  at my school with a 4.6 weighted GPA. My highest ACT composite score is a 31 (pretty low), but if I superscore, I will have a 33 ACT score with math being my lowest at a 29 (pretty pathetic for an engineering and comp sci school). In my superscore (scores from 3 tests), I would have a 29  - Math, 35 - Reading, and 34 - ELA and Science. I obviously don't plan on going into engineering or comp sci at tech. I was looking to go into something similar to MIS, international policy and affairs, and business. My sister graduated from Tech 2 years ago, and she got a job right out of college with her degree. 

In addition to all the boiler plate information I have: 100+ hours of community service hours, I work outside of school, I am in school clubs (Model UN, NHS, Math and Science Club, Student Council), and other unimportant stuff.

Title. I'm a second year business student who studied abroad this summer. In HS I lifeguarded but that's it for work experience.

I know this is the time of year when people look for stuff next summer, so I was wondering where to look/what resources to use to find an internship (probably in ATL). I'm currently trying to figure out CareerBuzz. Is that the main/best online resource or are there others? Also, can anyone fill me in on what kind of resources Scheller might have?

I was offered transfer pathway program that gives me strong consideration for my transfer application to Georgia Tech's college of science if I apply for fall 2020, I really want to study at Georgia Tech so I'd like some suggestions. Any help will be appreciated.

Rn my major is just mathematics because UF has only mathematics, once I transfer I will be (probably) choose applied math. At this point I think I'm in a good standing of getting into it (perhaps), but I do wanna hear from people who can give me some ideas about how math and the transfer admission is like at Georgia Tech, or any advice in general. 

Other than that, I want to add CS as my second major after my first semester at Georgia Tech. Is this doable? My main concern is that I heard students can only add CS as a second major after they are done with your first major, so they might not get the CS classes you want as a non-cs student. How much would this policy impact a math student, if I want to double major in CS? 

I want to do a double major of math and CS because I plan to study for a master's degree on CS. I know this is a long journal, starting at UF as math and double major then study for CS after 4 years. It might be early for an undergraduate freshman, but I just wanna to learn some advice from people who have related experience on their academic life.
