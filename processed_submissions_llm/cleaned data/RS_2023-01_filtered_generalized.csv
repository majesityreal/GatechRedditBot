2/ Which is best for networking with potential employers?

3/ Any insights on how competitive the membership process is would be helfpul.

4/ Do people join multiple clubs? For example, CYC and Epic Intentions appear to be geared toward upperclassmen who are trained in case interviews and have developed skills already.

post,"Why is instructor different on the registration system?. So, I kinda built my schedule around a certain class and section (MATH 1554, section L). I sacrificed certain other classes in order to get Barone, who several friends of mine consider among the best profs they ever had. 
Yesterday, I showed up to the first lecture, and Barone was there. He started out by saying that our prof. is gonna be David Darlington, but he had ""transportation issues"", so Barone would teach the lecture this time. So, I couldn't observe my actual prof. 

So:
1. Does anyone have experience with Darlington? It'd be really helpful bc I couldn't find reviews anywhere (RateMyProf for GATech, for other colleges, or even Reddit).

2. Why did they lie in the registration system? Other sections taught by other prof showed ""Barone, Kumar"" or ""Barone, someone else"", or ""TBD"". If people predominantly favor one prof over others (bc sections L and J filled out quicker than others ran out of half of spaces), that's not a justification to lie about the instructor. Is there some good reason for that I am not seeing? 

3. Is there some way I can prevent a situation like that in the future? Some place to actually see who will teach the section?

4. There is a section J that's actually taught by Barone (it's written on Canvas). Is it realistic to go to those lectures, or will I likely miss some material/info?

post,"[Airsoft Club @ GT] Intro Meeting Thursday 5:30 PM @ Skiles 371!. ***EDIT 2:  We finally rescheduled our first meeting! The first meeting will be*** ***next Thursday (Jan 26), 7 PM at Skiles Classroom 202*****. Hope to see you there!**

***~~EDIT: MEETING HAS BEEN CANCELLED DUE TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM AND TORNADO WATCH! WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE LATE NOTICE! New date will be announced as soon as it's decided. Please DM for Discord invite in the meanwhile! Thank you!~~***

Hi everyone! Hope everyone is having a great first week!

My name is Eric, a 4th year CS student serving as the President of Airsoft Club.

I want to announce that we will be having our first meeting for this semester ***~~this Thursday~~*** ~~(1/12) at~~ ***~~5:30PM~~*** ~~in~~ ***~~Skiles Classroom 371~~***~~!~~

We will be discussing what Airsoft is (short answer: a team-based sport where we use air-guns that shoot small plastic pellets to out your opponents), answer general questions like club fees and gear rental, introduce the exec team, and just hang out. I know Airsoft may seem intimidating at first, but it's a whole lot of fun and a great way to get out of your dorm on the weekends! Also, it's comes to a lot of people as a surprise, but ***you don't need ANY experience or ANY gear to get started***.

Cool story--last semester, we participated in a multi-day continuous (which means night raids are included) MilSim operation (short for Military Simulation) in Barnwell, South Carolina, in a fight against a fictional faction over a decommissioned nuclear power plant, complete with vehicles and helicopters, all while camping and having a great time.

***So, if you have any questions (or can't make the meeting), don't hesitate to reply to this post, or even DM me! We also have a Discord, so ask me for an invite!***

Hope to see you there, and have a great first week!",Positive,Airsoft Club Intro Meeting.,9,2023-01-10,"meeting, club, introduction, airsoft, event, announcement, discussion, q&a, fun, experience, gear, team, sport, weekend, dorm, milsim, operation, adventure, discord, invite"

post,"Being new here, am I asking for too much?. For some context, I just transferred over this semester and was a pretty social person where I was from (went to some parties, had a couple friend groups, etc). But even though it has just been 3 days of classes I already feel lonely and stressed about some stuff, but I also feel like I'm asking for too much.

I have gotten decently close to a couple of my roommates and plan to join a club after being introduced to some by talking to some people in my classes, but that's the extent of my socialization; occasionally talking to roommates, sometimes talking to one person in class, then staying in my dorm for the rest of the day. I guess I see some of my home friends having relationships and socializing a lot at their university, so I kinda feel down already but at the same time I'm pretty sure I'm asking for too much just being here for not even a week.

Secondly, being a transfer student makes getting my courses so difficult it's crazy (at least for first semester). I'm in 3 basic courses at the moment (7 credits) but need to get my major courses done so I can graduate on time, but I still haven't gotten off the waitlist for any of the courses I need to take. I have been bugging my counselor and registrar about getting my courses cleared on time as well since they still haven't cleared pretty much 1/3 the courses I took back home yet which are NEEDED to take the major courses if I do get off the waitlist. I feel like I'm wasting so much time and money here because of this, but again, it has just been 3 days that classes have started.

With these I just have some questions: 

Is there some sort of way to see where and when events are happening and what clubs to join (ways to socialize more)?

Even though the time for us to register for classes was literally a week before they started, is it still possible that I will get into the courses that I want to get into (can I talk to the professors about it)?

Lastly, am I asking for too much?

It's fine to be as honest as possible, plus I also made this post on a burner fyi. Thanks everyone :)",Neutral,Adjusting to a new university as a transfer student.,15,2023-01-11,"transfer, university, adjustment, socialization, courses, events, clubs, registration"

post,"Most of Georgia Tech faculty cannot fathom the energy to be nice people. Just want to say that in my past few years at Tech I have encountered rude professors, and even ruder working faculty/staff. Almost always through email where they can hide behind their screen, and hope to never meet us. I just really do not understand why they have to be so rude, and give sarcastic responses to genuine questions. My friends, as well, have encountered rude faculty, which I come to learn is the majority rather than the minority. Not to say I don't understand that they must constantly be bombarded with emails and requests, but I suppose the money coming from our pockets to pay them is not reminder enough that they could be a decent human. Or the fact that maybe we are stressed students trying to get our schedule together, in need of genuine advice, or need to hear back in a time of urgent need and stress. I understand how asking questions that have answers on the syllabus or on some website could be frustrating, but the fact I have not even done that but the responses are still rude? This goes from advisors to professors to even the bus drivers on campus. When I first came to Georgia Tech I had come from a bubbled environment where everyone were nice people. My first rude encounter with the professor almost made me cry (she had said we could email her asking what our final grade would be, and when I did she snapped and ranted at me how busy she is). Like to them they could feel some sort of weird satisfaction in belittling a student, but I don't think they even understand how this impacts us? Not only the stress from classes there's stress from home environments, financial situations, and just life in general. It really does not take much effort to be nice. Especially if you're simply a faculty member, and you're not even here to do research but literally just work for the school and its students. It can be easy to belittle students when you have no clue what they're going through, and more likely than not they will never write a rude and sarcastic email out to you.

post,"CS 3600 - or should I say 6601?. This class is wild - I've spent 20 hours on this homework already and only at 30 points. Plenty of people are in the same boat with this homework as well. 

The flipped classroom setting is terrible, and the class has a massive time sink with the ludicrous homework, weekly modules, and readings. 

The course has been modified to match the graduate 6601 AI course, with the same assignments - they even send announcements with 6601 in the title instead of 3600 - overall leaving many of us feeling mislead from what we expected during registration.

Had I known the class has taken such a massive increase in difficulty this semester I absolutely would have avoided registering for it with my already busy schedule. Talking to people who had taken the course previously were pretty confused when I had told them the time commitment and difficulty of the assignments. 

Despite Professor Starner being more generous with the grade scale, the course is already starting to drastically cut into the time I have left to spend on my other classes.

Overall, it feels like the CoC drastically fucked up the way the class was meant to be run, even with the larger enrollment this semester.

My name is Eric, a 4th year CS student serving as the President of Airsoft Club.

I want to announce that we will be having our first meeting for this semester THIS Thursday at 7 PM @ Skiles 202! We moved the date from earlier (due to heavy thunderstorms).

We will be discussing what Airsoft is (short answer: a team-based sport where we use air-guns that shoot small plastic pellets to out your opponents), answer general questions like club fees and gear rental, introduce the exec team, and just hang out. I know Airsoft may seem intimidating at first, but it's a whole lot of fun and a great way to get out of your dorm on the weekends! Also, it's comes to a lot of people as a surprise, but ***you don't need ANY experience or ANY gear to get started***.

Cool story--last semester, we participated in a multi-day continuous (which means night raids are included) MilSim operation (short for Military Simulation) in Barnwell, South Carolina, in a fight against a fictional faction over a decommissioned nuclear power plant, complete with vehicles and helicopters, all while camping and having a great time.

post,"Crosland's Rooftop Sucks! (Rant). Alright, this has been on my mind for a while so I will finally spew it. The tinted glass on Crosland's rooftop is one really horrible idea!! Here is why:

A) Ruins potentially one of the best (and probably only) view of Tech Tower and the skyline. Its optical interactions with sunlight leads to one horrendous brain numbing viewing experience.

B) Little to no artistic value (at least in my opinion since that is subjective). And if there was any, it can be easily preserved by relocating the thing to a more suitable place.

C) No historical value (I could be ignorant too) so that does not help the case either.

I really am not sure if this is an unpopular opinion so please let me know what you guys think of it. If there is good consensus, maybe we should sign a petition, and relay our voices. Heck I am also willing to organize protests against its existence. I find it pretty conceivable that a good majority dislike it but no one talks about it.

Anyways, everything on campus is well thought out but this sadly just sticks out to me as a sore thumb. I really think the rooftop can be made into a much better place, it has plenty of potential but this is definitely not it.

So yeah...thanks for listening to my rant! Venting feels good and I think I can sleep peacefully now.

post,"Bike and Scooter Safety Reminder. Good afternoon, Sgt. Strully here with some safety reminders! In order to make campus safer for everyone, we have begun targeted education and enforcement efforts at campus intersections with respect to cyclists and scooter operators. Remember:


* Bicycles and scooters must obey all traffic laws and sidewalks.
* Motorized vehicles may not be driven or ridden on the sidewalks.
* Vehicles must yield to all pedestrians in crosswalks.
* Pedestrians must use the crosswalks.


GTPD is going to start with warnings to violators, but we *will* be escalating to citations (yes, you can get a ticket on a bike or a scooter) in the future.


Here are some further resources to help educate everyone on safe riding:

They quickly took action by cowering-I mean taking cover-under the middle awning and staring with a mixture of confusion and disbelief at the family of squirrels that inhabited Brittain Dining Hall yesterday. To counteract this threat, the unit resorted to pointing and discussing amongst themselves while the squirrels sought to defend the high ground from the inevitable attack.
