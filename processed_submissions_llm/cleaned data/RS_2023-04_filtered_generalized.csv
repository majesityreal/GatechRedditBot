post,"Rejected as Transfer Student even after meeting all Conditional Transfer Pathway Program requirements. So, a friend of mine was offered the option of the Conditional Transfer Pathway Program for Summer 2023 last year, which guarantees admission as a transfer student. He met all the requirements for the program, but just received a rejection letter from admissions. Is this an error on admissions part or can you actually get rejected from the conditional transfer program?

Edit: It turns out he screwed up his sequential lab sciences and was rejected because of that. He had gone to the registrars office to get clarification on the lab science requirement a year ago, but they gave him the wrong info. He lost his conditional pathway and will now have to keep reapplying as competitive transfer unfortunately.

Edit 2: Great news! So my friend spoke to the registrars office and they admitted they were at fault for giving the wrong info about the lab science requirement and wrote it up in an email. My friend was then appeal to use that email as grounds for an appeal and he just found out that he got accepted today!

post,"GT Transfer Tool: Find Courses that Transfer Back to GT. I've been seeing some discussion about transfer courses, and with summer approaching, I wanted to share a tool I made called [GT Transfer Tool](https://gt-transfer-tool.com/). [GT Transfer Tool](https://gt-transfer-tool.com/) helps you find courses that transfer back to Georgia Tech. It is similar to the existing [Transfer Equivalency Table](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_location) except that it also goes in the reverse direction i.e. showing all transfer courses available for a specific GT class. With the availability of online classes in schools, you may no longer be limited to your local vicinity to find classes. This can especially be useful for general education requirements that are common across many schools.

The following are excerpts from the GT Registrar's Office about the Transfer Policy and Residency Requirement:

>Georgia Tech accepts credit for coursework as listed on the transfer equivalency table online at oscar.gatech.edu. If the course is not listed on the transfer equivalency site, the course must be submitted for review to Transfer Credit site.  
>  
>If the transfer equivalency site states: No Credit for Online Section, you will need to submit a syllabus for the course to be reviewed. Please allow time for review and the update on the equivalency table.  
>  
>No student may be considered a candidate for a degree unless the final 36 credit hours required for the degree are earned in residence at Georgia Tech and approved by the major school.

post,"Regarding unsubsidized PhD health insurance if one has a fellowship. A few months ago, I asked if anyone knew why PhD health insurance was unsubsidized when someone (like me) was on a fellowship. I deleted my reddit account since then, but I made a new one because I wanted to provide some additional information on this topic for other students facing the same issue. I hope this information can help new students work with the administration to find a suitable compromise, or at least help them understand the background on the issue. The first paragraph will give some background on the health insurance problem PhD students with fellowships face, the second an argument for why this is a problem, the following paragraph will outline my conversation with an upper level GaTech finance employee and finally I will wrap up with my thoughts. All numbers in this post refer to the 2021-2022 academic year.

For context, all PhD students who are employed by the school have 70% subsidized health insurance that drops the yearly $2,805 health insurance to $841.5. Some PhD students apply for and receive fellowships, like the NSF or NDSEG, that pay a slightly higher yearly income (ranging from around $5,000 more a year to $12,000 depending on the amount each school pays). At GaTech, those who are awarded with these fellowships are not considered school employees anymore and are thus charged the $2,805 cost for health insurance. For example, students who receive the NDSEG have $1,400 in health insurance yearly covered, and this means they are responsible for an additional $1,405. This amount is $563.5 more than those with subsidized health insurance.

This amount operates like a tax on the students who receive the funding which can frustrate them, as these fellowships don’t just benefit the students, but also the university and academic advisors. One, the university receives a lot of prestige based on how many of its students receive fellowships. In fact, universities often use these fellowships as evidence of their prestige to attract international talent and raise business interest in its graduates. Additionally, each student’s fellowship brings in tens of thousands of dollars to the university. This saves a student’s advisor money for certain things like tuition and overhead that the advisor would normally pay as well and allows that advisor to use their funding to hire an additional student, which increases the research output of the university, and, thus, the prestige. Given this fact, it would make sense that the university would not want to alienate those with fellowships, and, in fact, many universities do not. They do not charge fellows more for things like health insurance just because they have a fellowship, but not Georgia Tech. However, given my recent discussion with upper-level members in the finance office, I understand why they struggle.

Keep in mind this is my understanding from my conversation, so it may not be 100% accurate, but I wanted to provide some written documentation for future students dealing with this problem who want to try and address it. Essentially, because fellows aren’t classified as employees, they are not able to receive subsidized health care. Since GaTech is a state school and many fellows are out of state students, the only funds that would be able to cover this are donor funds. Many donors will only donate to cover research in specific areas, such as cancer research, so these funds cannot be used. If they donate to a general fellowship fund, those could be used, but these funds are also used to cover the Presidential Fellowship, which is a topper that helps attract PhD students who are ""highly qualified U.S. citizens"" (this is the school's logic, not mine, everyone here is highly qualified in my view). They do not want to deplete these funds, so promising to cover the difference in all fellows’ health insurance is a challenge.

In my view as a student with a fellowship, the current situation is unfortunate. From the student perspective, graduate school is already very financially challenging, and I know I wouldn’t have initially been able to go to Georgia Tech without the Presidential Fellowship. I do not want them to reduce the funding for it to make up the difference for the other fellowships' fellows' health insurance. I also understand why those with other fellowships (I received the NDSEG as well in my 2nd year) find it unfair they are being charged more money than other students just because they are receiving it. I think to address this issue, all students that face it need to collaborate to bring this issue up in a respectful way. The university is aware of it, but the individual I spoke with specifically stated that donors (who they get money from for these types of things) do not care as much when the administration says stuff. They care about how it impacts students. If other graduate students could collaborate with the administration on trying to raise donor funding, then perhaps this issue could be ameliorated. Alternatively, I do not see why fellows are not considered employees, and perhaps there could be some way to convince the university to reclassify us as employees. Regardless, I am coming up on my fourth year soon here and have other issues I am attempting to address, so I strongly encourage other graduate students to choose an issue (perhaps this one) and organize to fix it. I have had success organizing colleagues to address issues in my department's TA program, so it is possible if you can be pragmatic when dealing with your administrations.",Neutral,Unsubsidized health insurance for PhD students with fellowships.,20,2023-04-04,"healthcare, education, funding, university, fellowships, donors, collaboration, administration, students, challenges"

1. Do quant firms recruit from GT **for trading roles**? If yes, are they the big ones like 2sig, HRT, JS, etc? Or smaller ones? I know that quant is meritocratic and all, but does the GT name help/suffice?
2. Directly to quant trading roles Or going into SWE at FAANG/Shops/other known companies and then going to quant trading.. which in your opinion is better/more doable?
3. Do these quant shops come to campus for recruiting like tech firms do at career fairs?

post,"Incident during synth lab lecture. Hi everyone,

Most of y'all might not have known what happened yesterday, so heres the story for context:

A group of four or five guys that were not part of a lecture were sitting in the back of the lecture hall, and during the session, one of the guys was being obnoxious when the professor was trying to teach the class, like answering in class questions by shouting out jokes like ""lebron james"" and ""21,"" and being overall disruptive to the class. The professor asked him to stop but he wouldn't, so he got frustrated and angry, and asked the student to leave. He tried to stay in the class by remaining in his seat, and tried to say sorry and said ""I thought the joke was funny"" but the professor was silent and was not going to continue the lecture until the guy had left. The guy was stalling the class, slowly walking his way out, he even tried to sit in the back corner of the lecture hall to try and wait for the professor to give in and let him stay. He slowly walked down the stairs, and some people in the class were telling him to leave because he kept trying to stall and delay the class, and he shouted ""F U"" to them and left. For the next five minutes, he kept staring through the small glass of the window, and then he eventually walked back in with two soda beverages trying to apologize to the professor, asking him to accept them and let him back into the class. The professor said no and asked him to leave, but he still tried to get him to accept the drinks. The professor then said that he will call GTPD if he does not leave. He put the drinks down on the podium and walked towards the door, but he did not go through it and was hiding behind a blind spot of where the door is. He then tried to peer over behind a wall to see if we noticed him. At that moment one of the guys walked down towards him, grabbed him, and shoved and dragged the guy out the door with him. The other remaining guys walked their way out through the door, and none of them returned to the class after that. Since physical confrontation was present at that point, the professor had to call GTPD to file a report, and class was dismissed early once the police arrived.

And during all of this, my friends and I were scared and anxious, not knowing what was going to happen next, because we didn't know if it was all fake or not. We were worried that when the guy left the first time, that he could come back in with a weapon. I'm so grateful that that was not the case, but it does not dismiss the fact that I'm angry about this. People were scared, they had adrenaline kick in, and some were scared of walking back home.

The strange thing is that even the person that shoved him out of the lecture hall was apparently also not part of the class. The question now is if they were even Tech students. I'm starting to think that it might be staged, which makes me even more mad.

Assuming that this was staged, why would you pull such a stupid prank or joke like that. The only thing that they accomplished yesterday was put fear in people. All for what? Gaining attention? Views? I didnt see any one of them recording but if they did I hope they realize how stupid they look.

Even if it was not staged,  it still falls on the guy who was being disrespectful. This is supposed to be a lecture, and I get that there can be a few jokes in class that might be more class related, but otherwise it is a serious learning environment. This guy was not obeying that, and was just outright being rude and disruptive. The professor asked him to stop multiple times and he still continued on with being obnoxious. People are trying to learn, and you're taking that away from them. You're just being a detriment to the school, whether you are an actual student here or not.

On a side note, I'll be honest, I am one of those people that complain about social media like Tik Tok and how its poisoning the minds of our generation even if to some people that might sound like an exaggeration, but honestly there's without a doubt that certain content on there promotes this sort of behavior, and even the defenders of social media cannot deny that this is a terrible outcome of it.

Im sure that the people on reddit are not prone to having this sort of behavior, but I really hope that anyone reading this does not mimic what happened yesterday. It's really not funny, in fact its actually infuriating to think about. You not only disrupt the class and prevent students from learning about their course and future assignments, you also put people in fear and distress. You only hurt yourself when you do something like this. Please think twice before you do this sort of thing, and ask yourself what could the outcome be. You might find yourself in a better position by shutting your mouth up and moving on rather than opening it and eventually getting your ass handed to you.

EDIT:

UPDATE:

Thank you all for the comments, makes me feel better about the situation. Anyways here is the update.

The individuals were identified and its **confirmed that they aren't enrolled at Tech, nor are they from in-state.** They traveled to Atlanta from out of state for some convention and had time before their return trip so that was when they decided to come to campus to do the pranks. Its also confirmed that they also went to other classrooms to do the same thing, which confirms the other cases some of y'all mentioned in the comments. **Charges are being pursued with the intention of warning them to not do this sort of thing again.**

Kinda do feel bad about them being pressed charges, but with there being five of them plus the teacher making it clear to stop, and they also did it in other lectures, from a perspective I think it is deserved. Still, makes part of me hope the charges are not as severe and that really in the end they just learn their lesson and not do it again. Especially during this time with all the violence and political drama, this sort of prank is just not worth doing since it has the potential to do damage. I understand that theres a time for being funny, and that this sort of thing might have be more acceptable and maybe funny in a different time period, but the timing was not good at all, and that they should have thought about it twice instead of making the situation into a headache for all of us.",Negative,Disruptive behavior during a lecture.,254,2023-04-04,"incident, lecture, disruption, prank, fear, consequences, social media, behavior, warning, charges"

Dear Georgia Tech Students, 

As you may know, micro-mobility devices such as e-scooters and bicycles have become increasingly popular on campus in recent years. We are a group of Georgia Tech students working on a Traffic Engineering Final Project that focuses on the safety concerns of micro-mobility devices across the campus. As part of our Traffic Engineering Final Project, we are conducting a survey to gather data and insights on the safety concerns related to micro-mobility devices on campus. Your participation in this survey will help us gain a better understanding of the issues and develop effective solutions to improve safety on campus. The survey will only take a few minutes of your time and is completely anonymous. You can find the link of the survey as follows:

I’m currently planning the funding for my admission to MS ECE this fall.

As a second-year CS Major with more projects and experience than my first-year self, it has been more difficult to get an internship this year than last year. Usually, it's supposed to be the opposite where the first year getting internships is hard, but that has not been the case for me.

My mindset coming into tech and before this semester was to focus on maintaining a 3.0 and grind more on your personal projects + learning new things in the industry. Basically, learning skills over school work as long as I'm over a 3.0. And it was working!! I landed an internship in my first year and I thought I was doing things right. But this year, after applying to so many places and not getting a single offer year, I'm starting to think if it's my GPA that's lacking?? 

I understand that there are layoffs, but at the same time some of my friends are getting interviews and offers much more easier than me who have a higher GPA but not more experience than me. And I'm so confused as to why this is happening.

And I really do mean partners, I understand that without help I can’t bring this idea to fruition, so I’m open to changes and criticism if anyone is willing to hear me out and sign a NDA.

post,"At Georgia Tech, We Care (Official Announcement From School Administration). As an official Reddit representative of **Georgia Tech University**, I am happy to announce our new well-thought plan of making students' lives easier and helping you academically during the exam month. 

In this post, I'd like to explain the reasons for the recent decision to postpone registration for some of the students and not others. 

We understand that course registration can be a bit stressful. We really do. That is why we decided that you all will be better off registering a couple of days later.

We then realized that we should take this further. If we give half of our seniors two days of extra registration in front of all others, they will take out all senior and junior courses! This way, we will save the hustle of registration for our juniors!

We do plan to force another outage when sophomores get to register to make our freshmen happy as well, but let us know your opinions in the comment section. 

We are also considering other plans, such as completely removing our online registration system. If students have to bring a physical list of their preferred class options in-person to the Registrar, we are sure it will create a great opportunity to socialize while standing miles in line! Because nothing brings people together like a common struggle. 



Follow our accounts if you are interested in our further developments! Without spoiling our surprises to student body, I'll just say you'll wanna be first to find out if we decide to cancel internet on campus in spirit of the Medieval Festival Week or switch all pass-fail courses to grades and vice-versa for next April fool's day.

post,"Early Stage Political Tech Startup Dev. EDIT: filled

Hey everyone. Local ATLien here with plenty of friends and family that went to GT—much respect. 

I'm working on a political tech startup, Civi, and our MVP is almost ready, but we need a Dev who can help us finish strong. Our current outsourced Dev needs help, and we'll transition him to part-time.

Comp is $2-3k per month commensurate on experience along with equity incentives for part-time work. Ideally, the right fit would stay on and become a tech leader at Civi in a larger capacity.

Full role description: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mp7G7u3MBJ4t-i7F9i0H6OLQCbbyWMmZZ_l1e46ceMY/edit 

Some background on Civi and the founders:

-two Yale alum: 6+ years of experience in political campaigns, communications, and fundraising (founder); 2+ years ex-Mckinsey and 2+ years in startup ops and fundraising (cofounder)

-advisors: former CTO of 30+ years with multiple $100m+ exits; national political operatives for various Presidents, Governors, Senators, etc. 

-frontend and UI is done. Backend database and microservices are currently being migrated to AWS.

-early adopters and investors are lined up",Neutral,Political tech startup development.,0,2023-04-11,"politics, technology, startup, development, team, experience, advisors, frontend, backend, database, microservices, aws, early adopters, investors"

post,"Georgia Tech Doesn’t Care About Its Students (Kanye reference lol). But no seriously, this whole situation is REALLY annoying.  For a school that’s #1 in the state, and really high up in the country, they do a piss poor job of acting like it. And as a student not on the inside , it just looks like tech is being greedy and not caring about its students. They brag about a record for most admitted students for 27, admitting more and more freshmen every year, and then every year without fail there’s a housing or registration (or both) issue, due to the fact that the website can’t hold so many people at once. Maybe if they took care of their students they already had, and downsized the amount of people they take in every year, they could actually have a good system up. And don’t even get me started on everything else, from dining hall salmonella and other sickness last year, to multiple dorms reporting rats and water issues, and the constant increasing moving out upperclassmen due to higher freshmen intake (example, last year eigth street was for upperclassmen and now like half of it is for freshmen).

This past semester was tough, I took 6 credits and both classes had group projects with weird deadlines.  It was tough to keep up with the various time zones and orchestrating all team members, and it added a lot of unnecessary stress to this semester.  Starting in the Fall, I'm dropping my load to 3 credits per term.  This summer, I'd like to get another 6 credits in, but I want to avoid group projects if at all possible.

My plan this summer was to take either CS7643 Deep Learning or CS 7646 ML4Trading as they are both related to my day job.  For the second class, I was considering MGT8803 Business Fundamentals for Analytics.  

If anyone's taken these courses before, I'd greatly appreciate insight into what's expected.  I want to get one more semester of 6 credits in before I reduce my course load.  My wife is expecting in the Fall so it's important I have classes w/o group projects.  I know it sounds silly, but getting everyone on the same page for project and orchestrating deliverables for deadlines throughout the semester has been taxing for me this Spring.

post,"Looking for students to participate in a paid research study about team-matching AI agent. Hi everyone!

We are a group of researchers in the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech and we are looking for students to participate in our study. Our research team is developing an AI agent named SAMI that can help students with project team formation. We envision SAMI to be able to make inferences about the students based on their self-introduction and provides recommendations of potential teammates based on those inferences. The goal of the current study is to understand students' reactions and perceived accuracy of SAMI's inferences, which will help us improve the agent design and performance in the future. 

This study will be conducted remotely and will last for 45-60 minutes. You will be compensated with $25 Amazon gift card upon completion of the study. To be eligible to participate in our study, you must be 18 years old or older and be located outside of EU and People’s Republic of China at time of study participation.

post,"Research Option for Junior Design - reasonable to pursue as a rising Junior with no Gatech research experience?. I'm going to be a rising junior, and I'm thinking about my junior design options for my CS degree (I know, I should've dealt with this earlier).

Right now, I'm about to submit the form for a VIP, but honestly I feel like I'm much more inclined to the research option. Thus far, I've been doing applied AI work under a lab at CMU and publishing some solid papers there, so I know research is something I enjoy doing.

For a while, I've been working on my own personal research in more fundamental AI work, and I've identified some GT professors who work in the area. This is something I'd work on anyway, so it'd be nice if I could cover Junior Design with it. I do have a couple concerns though:

1. Because I haven't really done research at GT, I haven't yet established an actual connection with any of the professors here. Is this potentially a problem? Do I need to be spending a significant amount of time working at a lab here before pursuing the research option?
2. I'm at the end of my second semester of my sophomore year - I don't know how people normally do this, but is research a risky option when you haven't done GT research before and you've gotten this far into your degree? The process seems to take 4 semesters, and I want to graduate on time - is this something that's fairly stable or am I taking a gamble here?
3. I want to get a PhD - I'm not sure if this is relevant at all, but one thing I understood was that having publications in your field is really helpful when it comes to PhD admissions. I have no idea if this is a stupid question but because it's important I wanted to put it here anyway: does taking something like Junior Design research in any way impede your general ability to work on a bunch of projects? Does it become this all-consuming thing, eating at your ability to work on more immediately publishable research?

Alternatively, I could pick the easiest Junior Design option (whatever that is) that takes the least amount of time, and do research separately.

post,"Asking upperclassmen or alum: how was your GPA progression?. Maybe its just my anxiety, but I always hear that GPA is a big deal when it comes to a lot of jobs. Since I did a pretty rough math for my first semester, my initial GT GPA was 3.09 this fall. It does seem like it will get a little better this semester, with it either being a 3.3 or 3.4 depending on a final. Also, I do know anything 3.0 or above for this school is good, but I know that some other jobs/scholarships/etc. like it higher (3.5+), so I was wondering about y'all's experience with it.

1. What was your lowest cumulative GPA? When was it? What is it now/what was it when you graduated?
2. How have you found your GPA impacted opportunities?
3. How much of a GPA jump is possible or how much is solidified later down the years? (I want to graduate with a 3.5 at least)

post,"are there any drawbacks to attending FYSA (gt europe)?. I was really surprised to get an invitation. although I’m sure they send invitations to a lot more students than the 50 who actually attend, I hadn’t actually wrote an essay in my FYSA application when they sent me the invite. I’m an international student so the cost of attending FYSA vs starting school in fall is comparable. Are there any drawbacks to attending FYSA?

Some drawbacks I’m thinking of (please rebut me if they’re wrong or if they’re right, how badly will they affect me and how to circumvent them):
1. Friends 
I know that the FYSA cohort will probably be closely knit, but what if there aren’t many from my major? Are there many international students amongst the 50? 
2. Extracurriculars
Will I miss out on being involved in clubs/sports/research/other commitments at GT? Is it difficult to hop aboard after coming back from GTE? 
3. Professors and faculty 
Will I limit my interaction with the GT faculty and miss opportunities to connect with my professors? This sounds so suck up and I know that even if I’m in GT it’s such a big school that they probably STILL won’t know me but the FOMO is still real
4. Classes
Will FYSA affect the number of credit hours I can complete in the first semester? Am I able to overload? Am I able to overload in GT in general?
5. Other LLCs
How does it compare to the Honours Program or the Grand Challenges LLC? Would any be more preferable over the others?

I am an international student, recently admitted into Georgia Tech CS, committed, and was also offered a FYSA@OXFORD program invitation 

Now I am really excited about it, since Oxford has been my dream university since I was 10 (couldn't apply due to visa complications) but I haven't been able to find much feedback from students that attended the program and so I want to ask you guys here

For those who attended, How was your experience in terms of course load, social life, internships and opportunities both during and after the program. Overall, would you say you benefited? And as an international, what would my best option be, this program, or living first year in Georgia?

Only to find that the classes they need,
Are full and gone with great speed.

Showing no seats left, crushing dreams,

post,"Have any Americans studied abroad at the Shenzhen satellite campus? What about the one in France? Was it worthwhile?. I toured ga tech the other day, as I'm in the state of ga I have free tuition through hope, and I want to major in engineering. To my delight, I discovered on the tour that ga tech also has a satellite campus in Shenzhen: one of my dream cities. So it seems the stars are aligning for me to go to Ga tech. However, I have 4 concerns, as a Jewish and gay American with ADHD. 

As an American, I'm slightly concerned about the current state of global politics. I don't want to make any assumptions about any governments, but I'd also rather be safe than sorry.
I'm Jewish, and I'm finding a surprising lack of information on how Jews are treated in China. I care more about the laws than anything, most of the world is antisemitic, and I can hide my identity, but I would want to know if word did get out.
Same as the Jewish thing, I could just hide that I'm gay, but again I want to know I'll be safe if it is discovered
And I have adhd, I know China is more stringent with prescription medication. I'm not sure I would be able to continue taking my ADHD medication if I'm in China.

If I do decide to go to Ga Tech, this opportunity could be the deciding factor. Given my reservations, I'm interested to hear everyone's experiences on the satellite campus; whether about similar concerns or just about how incredible the program is.
Thank you, I hope this reaches some people who have been to the Shenzhen campus- as I can't seem to find much information online!

A recent post caught my attention ([https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/12rvvek/does\_ellucian\_course\_registration\_have\_an\_api](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/12rvvek/does_ellucian_course_registration_have_an_api/)) not necessarily for the original question it was asking but because even if ellucian didn't have a proper API, I believe it would be possible to build a custom registration site by reverse engineering its API requests and sending them out from the custom site.

# is it possible?

I know its possible to write custom applications sitting on top of Georgia Tech's SSO (SAML) sign in system (i.e. gradescope, but I've seen others too) so theoretically you should be able to build a clone of OSCAR with your own custom features/better UI. Looking into it further, it seems both degreeworks and oscar store ""IDMSESSID"" in their cookies so I assume its the one responsible for authentication. Haven't confirmed it but seems likely, as the other cookies can be obtained by sending empty requests to certain URLs like a post request to [https://registration.banner.gatech.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/term/search?mode=search](https://registration.banner.gatech.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/term/search?mode=search) (what the gt-scheduler backend uses for its crawling). I'm sure there is some documentation for interfacting with the SAML system or worst case you can reverse engineer it from how gradescope's requests look like during the auth process.

Looking into the requests that are made when registering for a course, it looks like the main request is a POST request to [https://registration.banner.gatech.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/classRegistration/submitRegistration/batch](https://registration.banner.gatech.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/classRegistration/submitRegistration/batch) with a disguistingly long payload that does indeed contain the registration information of the course you want to register for, albeit with lots of other data.

# ethics/difficulty to implement

So based on all this I believe it is most likely possible to create a custom registration portal based by reverse engineering these requests, since there does not seem to be a formal API apart from their internal one. The requests look quite complicated though and it is definitely no small task, and you'll have to account for edge cases like major restrictions, linked sections, and much more. Not to mention the ethics / implications of making such a service including whether or not is goes against ellucian TOS or whatever.

It's very much possible that I could've missed some glaring reason why this wouldn't be possible, but it looks like the registration system communicates in post requests that can easily be forged if need be, and worst case if authentication doesn't work out you could possibly make some kind of chrome extension that pulls the cookies from your SSO login and uses them, although I feel like doing it the proper way would work. Speaking of which, that could be another viable alternative: just creating a chrome extension that augments the existing interface to make it easier to use, although a custom one would be better.

It needs more discussion but is most likely possible in my opinion, although possibly unethical. After all, a tool like this isn't too far from a tool that just automatically registers for you.

# potential features

The potential benefits of creating a custom registration site could include:

* A notification page that alerts you if you have moved up in any of your waitlist positions without you having to check them individually
* an easier to look at table UI with important notes added such as which courses are major restricted (ex: although the majority of MATH 3012 sections are major unrestricted there are currently two that are restricted to math majors) (these would be viewable without having to click around the UI like you currently have to), or where the section is located (again currently this involves clicking on a modal multiple times)
* for each section listed, the professor's corresponding RMP rating, difficulty, etc. and average course critique GPA baked into the same table UI.
* a prettier UI that's easier on the eyes, probably something similar to the design of GT scheduler that would also be responsive (viewable on mobile without significant cluttering of information)
* ""real time"" updates to the table UI to reflect changing seats (during times of rapid seat changes like when phase I time tickets open it would be useful to see changing seats without refreshing the page) (I say ""real time"" in quotes because there would likely be a \~84 second delay to refresh the data for all courses - I know this because I've coded up my own seat notification discord bot (if you can't beat em join em lol) and this is about how long it takes to scrape all \~12633 sections given a relatively modest request delay of 500 milliseconds and page size of 75 sections per request). Alternatively it would be possible to send the requests every x seconds from the browser directly instead of via a websocket from a backend scraper (kind of like grouch but in website form) for an almost instantaneous update, but sending that many requests repeatedly from potentially 100s of users would probably make the registration system shit itself lmao.
* course add/drop utilities: ex: if dropping a section and adding a new one simultaneously fails, then it automatically adds back the previously dropped section, etc. (edit: it's come to my attention this already exists in the new oscar)
* anything else lol

So those were some of my thoughts, although building such a thing would be an absolutely monumental task probably fit for a team of devs rather than a single one if it were to be implemented sooner than later. Just wanted to stir up some thoughts and discussion regarding the earlier mentioned post with some additional insights as a dev that's done some amount of fucking around with the registration system.

post,"Recommendations For Circuits/Analog or Op Amp Refresher Courses. I'm a CompE that graduated at the end of 2020 and ended working at an EE based company. I've enjoyed the software skills I've been able to bring to the company, but I honestly feel like I've been getting more and more behind when it comes to circuits, specifically analog circuits. The reason I feel this is happening is due to the nature of my position. To be honest it usually does not require high analog capabilities but more so just a general understanding of what is going on. Most of the hardware I work with has digital serial interfaces, so testing is straight forward. I don't do circuit analysis or design very often at all. The most complicated thing I've done hardware wise was setup an RC filter with a specified load. As a result, I feel like I am losing all my circuits skills. I enjoy working with hardware and wish to be the type of computer engineer that can dabble in both deep software as well as a strong understanding of basic circuit analysis and some analog circuits.

Does anyone have good recommendations for free online courses or material I could go through to strengthen these skills again? I guess I'm specifically asking other alum or maybe seniors or master's students. I'm looking to at least to strengthen all circuits analysis knowledge and re-learning basic analog circuits again. I have some schoolbooks but to be honest I don't think most of them focus on a practical understanding. I'm not trying to do too much unnecessary math as that is not what we do at work. I'm looking for something that reinforces concepts and really hits on the practicality and why we are doing things. I'm to the point that I am thinking of going back and getting an EE masters. For reference I did not take any analog circuits classes in undergrad so I don't know how much of a learning curve it would be. I know I probably should have but to be honest who knows exactly what they are going to do (or even want to do) after graduation anyhow.

post,"Finals week at Georgia tech, a tale as old as time. In the halls of Georgia Tech,
Van Leer's silence is kept,
Asbestos in the ceiling looms,
A reminder of the dark and gloom.

Therapy dogs and candy treats,
Meager offerings for mental health needs,
Distractions, but not enough,
To quell the fear and stress that's tough.

Competition and grades rule the land,
Innovation and creativity? Barely stand,
Soulless place where numbers reign,
Success the only goal, and never in vain.

But despite the weight and the pain,
Georgia Tech students remain,
Resilient, determined, and strong,
Working hard, to achieve their lifelong.

We may be in the city of Atlanta,
But finals week feels like a dragon,
Breathing fire on our spirit and soul,
The pressure of the ring, taking its toll.

Yet we persevere, with eyes on the prize,
We engineer the future, with honor and pride,
In this world of steel and concrete,
Our strength is found in the hearts that beat.

Our Tech family, a fellowship strong,
Together we push through what feels wrong,
In this high fantasy, a journey we embark,
With grit and determination, we light up the dark.

So despite the shadows that loom,

post,"CS MS difficulty and how to handle it?. Hey everyone, I’m a BSCS student right now and I applied for the BSMS. I’m really worried about the workload as a grad student though and wanted some honest advice and feedback. I had a lot of trouble with just the bachelor’s (I’m a junior but like 90% done with the degree), and people are saying just one MS class is like 20 hours a week. I ballparked like 40-60 hrs/week of work depending on if I get a part-time job or GTA/GRA but how do you survive this? Like if a class is 15-20hr/week and you take four that’s 60-80hr/week of grueling work not including any other life activities. Is this level of difficulty only if you want to keep honor roll? What does the workload look like in practice and how do you survive while still handling stuff like financing the degree, socializing, physical health, etc

Edit: for more context I was thinking of doing computing systems or computational perception and robotics but after some more responses it seems like these are the classes where you get 20+hrs/week of work. Any suggestions for something where I can do stuff like os, compilers, software dev process are appreciated.

post,"Freshman CS Internship Search for Next Summer. Hi everyone. I am an incoming freshman studying CS and looking to go into SWE/Quant. I have seen several posts on this sub saying that I should start looking for freshman internships now. I'll be entering college with an internship and research experience(going to be done within a professor's lab at the university I will be entering in the fall) during consecutive summers under my belt. I understand the market is pretty bad right now and thus getting an internship during the summer after freshman year will be hard. I won't be able to take DS/Algo during my first year but I will be self-studying during the year - hopefully to the point that by the end of the year, I can solve Leetcode Easys with a decent amount of confidence. I have found a repository like this: [https://github.com/codicate/underclassmen-internships](https://github.com/codicate/underclassmen-internships) that has a lot of opportunities for freshmen but if anyone has any other databases/places where this information is consolidated that would be helpful. I also think I will have an opportunity at a semi-big company next summer mostly due to nepotism/family connections. Is that something I take? Do I sort of punt on this year for internships and come back with a very strong resume for the summer after sophomore year(where I would aim for FAANG even though that is unrealistic), and take my freshman year to work on projects and flesh out my tech stack? Additionally, what are other things I can do to make my resume stronger? I'm looking into TAing as well as doing projects/hackathons/club involvements. Any advice in my search would be considered very helpful. I can also post my modified HS resume(and projected freshman resume) if needed.

Additionally, thoughts on changing my grad date(wouldn't be too dishonest since I am coming in with a lot of AP credit and could technically semi-feasibly graduate in 3) to try and get sophomore opportunities as a freshman? Maybe keep a couple different copies of my resume?

and finally, when should I start looking? some people say I should start in a couple months - which seems kind of weird because I'll be making an entire resume based on things I have not done yet, but others say January 24 will be too late.

PS: Is it worth it applying to minority/underprivileged programs if I am not what they're looking for?

post,"Is D a passing grade for ECE courses?. *Title Edit: Is a D a passing grade for ECE courses in an Electrical Engineering Bachelor’s program?

Asking because courses dealing with statistics have never been my strong suit - and for all my work I’ve put in to this course- it almost never feels like enough.

I’m within a decent range of getting below a C depending on my final grade, and although I feel confident enough in my potential final grade, it still makes me nervous. I noticed that Tech lists D as a passing grade in general, but it seems that CS courses in CS bachelor’s degree program are required to get C’s. It’s explicitly stated in the CS Bachelor’s degree program overview that Cs listed as required for a thread must be completed with a C+ to be counted towards degree requirement (I am Pre-Thread).

post,"Locked out of my account due to two-factor authentication. Hello!

I'm a prospective graduate student to Georgia Tech this upcoming Fall of 2023. Unfortunately I've been locked out of my passport account:

Last time I logged in, a notice indicated that two-factor authentication was not yet required of me. I was willing to set it up, but seeing that I would need to use a different application than Google Authenticator, I just logged out and moved on.

Logging in again, a notice indicated that two-factor authentication is now required, and that to proceed with logging in, I would need to set it up. Upon clicking 'Set up two-factor authentication with your phone', I am redirected to a page asking to authenticate with Duo to continue. However, I did not set up two-factor, and I don't have access to any codes. Pressing 'Need help?' produces a box with empty quotation marks. When I try to manage the devices on my account, it indicates that no devices have been paired with my account yet, which is true. I am an international student, so calling Georgia Tech internationally to fix this would be difficult. Upon trying to contact the OIT Enterprise Service Desk's link, I am also prompted to log in using a Duo code.
