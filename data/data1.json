            "selftext": "Hi all,\nI\u2019m an upcoming freshmen first the 2024-25 school year. I recently received an email from GT offering me the Tech Promise scholarship and was wondering if it\u2019s actually that good. It mentions that it \u201cwill meet 100% of your financial need, assisting with costs associated with housing, food service plan, books, supplies, personal expenses, and, of course, tuition and fees.\u201d However, is this saying it will cover all costs for food, housing, books, etc? Or does it vary based on how much aid a student actually needs? \n\nThe part about \u201c100% of your financial need\u201d is really tripping me up. I was wondering if any of yall have experience or information to share. I couldn\u2019t find much else online that gave a definitive answer. \n\nAlso, I know I shouldn\u2019t worry about this, but is this scholarship actually selective? Or is it given to pretty much any student who meets the income requirements? \n\nThank you all!",

It will cover the balance after your Hope/Zell, any other scholarships you may have received and any other grants like the Pell Grant. It will be obviously confirmed by your FAFSA and they will probably ask for supporting docs like your family tax returns. \n\nIt\u2019s a great scholarship!! Congratulations!\nIt should cover fees, housing, meal plan, books and a small personal expense stipend. Hope should cover your tuition.",

Specific offices, colleges, and programs at GT will seek out FWS students over other applicants, as it keeps the overhead cost of employment low (the government pays a portion of your income), making it a bit easier to get an on-campus position.",

Tech promise covers the gap in your financial aid, and does this in a way that you\u2019ll also receive a refund from GT- (when your financial aid goes over the COA) to help with books and materials and such. You can also request up to $1,100 for a laptop through tech promise! also, your cap and gown will be paid for when you graduate. Tech promise is extremely prestigious, it only goes to 75 freshman a year, so congratulations!!! Also, if you ever decide to live off campus, tech promise will also provide you money for housing (up to the standard housing allowance that is stated in the COA). \n\nBasically, tech promise will help you get through GT entirely debt free, and you should receive a financial aid refund (mine was about $700/semester this year) to help you cover books and materials. If you have any questions, shoot me a message! Congratulations!!",

I had many classes not transfer, which is okay because gt is a great school but all the hard work for those classes were thrown away. I want to switch out of CS because I dont enjoy coding that much and the field is SO oversaturated. I've always had an interest in robotics and I want to do something meaningful with my life. I'm aware with switching my major, it would take me longer to graduate but thats fine with me if Im enjoying what I do and create meaningful projects. I'm not sure if I should do CompE with a robotics and CHIA concentration or if I should go for EE or ME. I'm not too big on coding and I want to work with my hands. I'm also aware EE is very hard but if its something I enjoy and can make good money with after college then sign me up. Im not too sure which engineering to switch into because I dont want to waste even more time.",

EE and CompE curriculum is almost identical through the 2XXX level courses, aside from some extra CS classes that CompE\u2019s have to take, which you might already have credit for. After that, you\u2019d have to take 3040 and 3043 together, and likely 3025 at the same time, which is a notoriously difficult combination. They\u2019re very heavy on EE fundamentals: electromagnetics, solid state physics and circuit analysis. If you\u2019re not motivated to study these topics, it\u2019s going to be a very brutal semester. If you are, then you\u2019d be able to succeed, but not without a significant amount of effort.\n\nAfter that, you\u2019d just have threads left within the major and you\u2019d be able to study robotics and another thread. The robotics thread is mostly controls which is very math heavy, looking into systems, impulse responses, laplace transforms, etc. \n\nIf your interest is really only in robotics, I\u2019d probably recommend taking CompE, not because it\u2019s easier (I can\u2019t speak towards the difficulty of the major) but because I think it matches your background better and would probably be the path of least resistance to get there. \n\nAs for ME, I can\u2019t comment much on it either but I\u2019d probably say the same as EE; if you don\u2019t have any interest outside of robotics, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. However, their robotics program is different, and I\u2019d recommend looking into it to see if you\u2019re more interested in those topics than the EE/CompE robotics thread.",

I recently received an email suggesting there would be another 5 assignments in the remaining 30 days of the semester (ie weekly assignments). This seems like a complete change to the course expectations, and I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this in other classes. In my opinion, weekly assignments shouldn\u2019t even be allowed in grad courses. Most grad students have more important things to do than coursework.\n\nEdit: I feel like there\u2019s no downside to sharing what course this is. It\u2019s AE6012 with PK Yeung.

(approved by Couchman) It will be on April 5th (a Friday!) at Tech Green (the giant green space in the middle of campus by the student center) from 3-11pm, and will be most importantly FREE and OPEN TO ALL. If you are not familiar with the ATL DIY music scene, this is the perfect chance to get familiar with some of the best prog rock, noise rock, emo, shoegaze, and math rock Atlanta has to offer, alongside some acts hailing from outside the state. Personally, I just wanna let you know that you do NOT want to miss this as this is a once-in-a-lifetime lineup that will go down in the history of 1000 Couches and Couchella lineups!!! That's it, see you there! P.S. Couchman might make an appearance ;) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b38k1sd6owqc1.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6714812bec4b190faf4239beccda312c7e5ccd65",

We think it\u2019s worth it (but we\u2019re maybe a little biased, as we\u2019re hosting the event)!\n\nThis is the first time we\u2019re hosting Grad Gala since 2020, so there may not be many graduate students around who attended the last one. However, in 2020, tickets were also $45 and we sold out all 500 of them. The event was a hit!\n\nWe got a ton of support from the various Colleges and Departments to help us host the event this year, and trust us that we\u2019re subsidizing it as much as we can. Formal events (and especially alcohol) are just pretty expensive these days, but we\u2019re happy to have been able to not increase the cost since the last time the event was hosted.\n\nEach ticket comes with admission, entertainment, hors d'oeuvres, and two (alcoholic) drink tickets (non alcoholic drinks are unlimited).  We\u2019re happy to answer any questions you have about the event!",

I\u2019ve volunteered there once a week for over 3 years now, and I\u2019ve never met a more dedicated group. All the volunteers and workers LOVE those cats and will do anything for them. I\u2019ve genuinely never seen anything questionable go on. The cats all receive excellent medical care, as there are multiple vet techs and 1 full time and 1 part time vet on staff. And if it doesn\u2019t work out or your pet gets really sick and you can\u2019t afford treatment or for any reason whatsoever, they will always take back a cat adopted from them. It\u2019s also a cageless shelter, so you get to really interact with the cat and sit with them before you adopt. 10000/10 I love it there, cannot recommend enough.\n\nEdit: They also have a 96/100 rating on Charity Navigator and post their tax forms every year, so you know the finances are legit too.",

So basically, I wasn't sure about accepting the offer until recently, and I was more focused on looking for jobs in the earlier part of the semester.\n\nHowever, now that I plan on staying for a year longer, I am trying to look for internships this summer, but I know I am a bit late to the game. A lot of offers seem to be gone, and I guess I regret not being decisive about job vs internship earlier in the semester.\n\nIs it really too late to score an internship? For those who are still searching/have gotten offers really recently, what resources have been helping?\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "\\[Throwaway\\]\n\nI have some questions regarding RSO ethics and morals. I'm interested in gauging public opinion on distinguishing between behaviors labeled as \"college kids being college kids\" and those deemed inappropriate for a Registered Student Organization (RSO). I'm trying to ascertain whether my concerns are overly stringent or if there are genuine issues at hand.\n\n1. Regarding alcohol events without proper authorization and the presence of minors: While it's not uncommon for minors to consume alcohol in college settings, if RSOs hold unofficial events not listed on their official platforms (such as their Engage page), and fail to adhere to institutional protocols regarding alcohol events\u2014such as obtaining required waivers or appointing sober monitors as outlined in GT policy\u2014does this fall under the umbrella of typical collegiate behavior or is it inappropriate for an RSO? What about traditions at these events that involve getting minors to drink?\n\n2. What are your thoughts on RSOs using their funds for such events? This includes collecting entry fees or utilizing dues/fees paid by students for exclusive board/executive member gatherings. Note that in that last situation, the students who paid the dues/fees are not eligible to come to the events, only the board/executive members of the RSO are allowed. Additionally, what's your stance on RSOs potentially accessing funds from various sources such as SGA, RHA, or Parents funds for these events? While the funds might not directly finance alcohol purchases but instead cover expenses like venue bookings, is this practice acceptable?\n\n3. Concerning the use of SGA funds for purposes not explicitly indicated on invoices/bills: Given the challenges in obtaining funding from SGA, do you believe that if strategies such as submitting a bill for something and then utilizing the funds to do something else prove successful, they should be employed? I know SOFO reimburses clubs but I'm coming from the angle where RSOs might get invoices for one item from a vendor, and show that to SOFO, but then not use that money reimbursed for that, either through a deal made with the vendor or through refunds/returns offered by the vendor. This entails generating invoices that may not accurately reflect the RSO's expenditures.\n\nI'm seeking clarity on these matters to determine whether my concerns align with broader perspectives or if they are indicative of a more stringent viewpoint.\n\nIf this sounds reminiscent of ChatGPT, it's because I utilized it to refine the questions for clarity. English is not my primary language, and I wanted to ensure the questions were articulated as effectively as possible.",

Tldr, one bad apple can spoil the barrel :(\n\nFor the RSOs that are doing this, this is 200% NOT ok to abuse the system like this and ruin it for the rest of us RSOs who are working hard and doing our absolute best to comply with rules and regulations (there are so many already, it is what it is). Again, RSOs that are partaking in this this behavior *will* ruin it for the rest of us, and it's already as hard as it is getting money (re: SGA running out of money TWICE without any prior warning) trying to fund events for members possibly due to reasons like you mentioned, which makes me really sad and frustrated. Smaller clubs like my own are really feeling the weight/hit of these funding lapses in trying to keep member engagement up. \n\nI don't feel more can be done about the receipt issue without heavily impacting especially smaller and younger RSOs for the worse - I'd actually strongly advise against any further rules imposed on the rebursement process (we already submit a cleared bank statement and invoice) due to the funds OFTEN coming out of officers' *personal checking accounts* and then taking easily a month for reimbursement with the current process in place due to SOFO being perpetually broken for lack of better term. To put into perspective: when you're paying for *$3000 worth of food out of your own banking account* because you cannot in good faith trust SOFO to clear your GTF (if your RSO has one) or custodial account in time for payment, the last thing you want is for more delay on getting that money back from Parents Fund/SGA/Buzzfunds. \n\nI really do believe the majority of RSOs are here because they want to make a positive impact on the student culture and general community at large (my RSO is a small philanthropic one, and I know my board works and arm and a leg BTS to make it an org with a mission we stand behind), but unfortunately such issues will persist. I do want to take a \"holier than thou\" stance with my RSO but rather use it as an example of what most RSOs are doing - working hard and trying their best to comply with things. \n\nI think one way to combat this issie without massively impacting things for all other RSOs is ito make it so a student can file a concern/complaint to SGA about a certain RSO's misuse of funds for alcohol, SGA can conduct an investigation, and then use leverage of it coming back on the exec team + get the RSO advisor involved (also really sucky of the RSO to not consider how this could affect their sponsoring GT faculty :/).\n\nSo there's my unfiltered 3 cents heh :')",

I took calc BC in senior year of highschool and got a 4 on the AP exam, giving me credit for both of the classes. I am currently a second semester CS freshman. My uncle and an alumni from here keep saying that I should retake the classes because I will learn so much more than I ever could in the AP class. I do not care if calc 1 and calc 2 are harder here, I will find some way, probably (lmao), and I do not mind being \"behind\", as well as the money but what do y'all think? Are they worth retaking at GT? Or should I go ahead and go forward in multivariable calculus? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much :)",

Multi-variable calc is really simple in the beginning and you can refresh your calc knowledge during the first half of the semester. Shit gets quite tough and weird at the end of the course, but if you did well enough in the beginning, you will have a buffer. Even if you have to squeeze by with a C, it is much better than retaking.",

            "selftext": "Hey! I am submitting this as an update to a post I made on this account a few months ago\n\nLink: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/17b26d9/maybe\\_i\\_do\\_not\\_belong\\_at\\_georgia\\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/17b26d9/maybe_i_do_not_belong_at_georgia_tech/)\n\nYou can (probably should) read that post for context. TLDR for this one: I am still not really doing well. I am unsure if this school is a good fit atp. I especially would appreciate advice from those who have taken alternative routes to get here (or even left if you're in this subreddit!). Also, students that aren't so intensely stemy.\n\nI have tried a lot of the advice given underneath the post. I didn't give up and I have been doing well on paper. But, I feel like I am in a dark place mentally.\n\nI have meet more people, but this school makes everyone so busy and I am just not high on people's priority list. I wish I at least had a consistent study group. I finally started psychotherapy and medication for my ADHD which has helped, but it does hurt when they recommend \"body doubling\" and I have no one to do that with. It feels like I am lost in a sea of people. It doesn't help that their productivity doesn't motivate me anymore. It just makes me feel like I am wasting all this time being sad when I am suppose to be actually working. Self fulfilling cycle.\n\nI'm not sure if I like my major anymore. I dread taking upper division courses soon. I feel stuck because this school is such a stem bubble, so I feel like if I choose another option I am going to be fucked. Probably not realistic, but I have no idea what to do. The only classes I really enjoy taking are LMC courses and some maths. That could be a solution instead of just transferring, but I am completely unsure of what to do. I feel like honestly I should've went to a school with a bigger arts department, instead of such a STEM heavy school. I have a lot of different hobbies that I would to realistically pursue, but the bubble makes trying too feel futile. I feel like being here has changed me in a bad way.\n\nI have tried so many different ways to be happier here, but it seems most of my complaints come back to this school's environment. I've have done so much personal work to try to become \"better\". I think atp I have used up most of my avenues. I might be clouded in my judgement, but something about being here is very depressing about being here. Part of it is probably that it feels like others don't share my feelings, which I know is not true, but it's hard to gauge that when it seems no one really wants to gain or deepen their friendships with me. I have joined support groups which make me feel a bit better, but idk.\n\nI don't feel this way when I am at home, even tho I don't even *like* being at home. Coming back here after spring break made me very emotionally upset, and I have tests coming up that I need to score high on. And homework due right after break. etc etc. So now I feel like my rest isn't even due. I kinda dread being here. I don't want to feel that way. I don't even really have anything to look forward in the summer except sleep since I haven't gotten an internship or well *anything.*\n\nWhat I do know is that I feel significantly better around people from other schools in the area. Which, in theory, should be easy to find a tech equivalent, but it's not happening. It makes me feel trapped since obviously I spend most of my time here, so this should be the environment I at least mildly enjoy.  I know some of the judgement is in my head, but they feel a lot less judgy and have things they do that aren't pure academic pressure points. They are hobby groups here, but having conversations just leads straight back to how \"oh I didn't sleep because I studied all night\" or \"Oh I'm have like 3 tests this week\" like omg. I just want somewhere that's a complete destressor place. The times I have found those, people don't come long term! I'm in groups on campus that have dwindled down to 3-4 people. (Feel free to recommend orgs below, there's so many here so this might just be a spotlight issue).\n\nThey also seem to just judge me less...socially? Like no offense to anyone here (please I get it I am also nerdy and introverted), but a lot of y'all are socially awkward to a fault. I have the most luck making very temporary connections at parties, otherwise I am not sure what I am doing that's wrong. I have had long talks about it with my therapist, and she has some theories about me (I'll only expand if asked lol). This makes me hesitant to give up entirely, however,  I even see this problem in a lot of group activities I do (not even trying to make friends I just want to work on projects efficiently). I am definitely a similar breed, but that feels so weird! Why am I one of the *more social* people on campus but the least social at home??\n\nThere have been events this semester I have enjoyed, but they are dampened due to how much WORK I have despite not taking that many credit hours (I have a grivance which a certain class but I don't want to say too much). So, either I go to the event and feel like I could've used that time doing work, or I do the work and feel stressed. This is something I have personally improved, however, this late into the semester makes me feel like I'm playing catch up. I am seen as quite bubbly and personable to many, so no ones really check in on me. I feel not only isolated but a bit masked as well to people.\n\nIt even got to the point I decided to attempt to look at some actual social clubs. For some, that would mean greek life. Being black (and a women since people did not clock that on my last post. Might be part of the reason why I feel the way I feel about these orgs) I tried to attend some Divine 9 (google if needed) related events. However, I do have some reservations about them, which is a whole other conversation. In short, I realized even if I joined one, my problems wouldn't be solved really.\n\nThe institution is also irritating me (again). I feel like I'm jumping through hoops to fix problems that aren't even my fault. It can take days for them to reply to me, and I even once got an email reply after I got no confirmation on something basically saying \"students aren't told every step of the process\". I just wanted to know if they received my documentation or not :(.\n\nThere might be something that I should do that I am missing. I already contacted a friend to talk about it since I know people (even you people of reddit), would prefer to hear my problems than hear that I had a mental health episode. But yeah, it's heavy times for me.",

The STEM thing is all a big joke at the end of the day, people put way too much weight on the idea and that influences how they view GT as a whole. LMC, Business, Design etc are all great majors here with awesome professors.\n\nAlso, you are welcome to transfer colleges, but I'd be surprised if much changed socially. There are obviously some awkward people at Tech, but by and large it's the same people you'd find anywhere, just maybe a little more GPA focused. Stereotypes can influence how we view our environment and you might be stuck viewing Tech through a stereotypical lense. There are friendly people everywhere here, they might just be doing their own thing. I'm telling you this because I'd hate for you to put in all the effort to transfer schools only to realize the grass isn't greener.",

I don't know much about transferring majors, but I'm sorry things have been really rough for you. \n\nI empathize with the imbalances of communicating with others. That issue of you being the only one to reach out, or the only one to coordinate plans, was something I had to navigate the beginning of this fall. \n\nMy solution was to find activities that I was comfortable doing with others (if they happened to join) but that I can do on my own. Furthermore, I try to seek out people to talk to one on one (since groups are more difficult to work with sometimes), and after that, I opt for studying hard and doing research I care about. As my schedule continues to get busier, I have less time to worry about other people, allowing me to more naturally stop communications with someone if they haven't consistently reciprocated. \n\nIt's important to remember that the lack of communication isn't your fault, but that means you've got to also identify what makes you content, happy, or gives you meaning separately from others. I wish you the best of luck with everything, and please be kind to yourself!",

I was also female, (although not Black or a minority,) way back when the ratio was I think even smaller than it is now, and I felt quite alone and struggled a lot my freshman year too. \n\nBeing a female at Tech can be very isolating in a lot of ways, especially in certain classes. And not having a social scene you feel connected to can make it even harder. I appreciate all you\u2019ve done to try so hard and to try and change your circumstances. \n\nI will say that the best decision I made (and it sounds counter intuitive) was to take summer classes after my freshman year. I met some of my best friends that summer because it\u2019s a much more relaxed environment, professors are generally more chill, and the things going on around campus were more fun to me. \n\nAlso you say you aren\u2019t looking forward to upper level classes, but I found those to be easier and more helpful in making friends as well because they were smaller and required group work, and often had the same people in them. I settled into my niche part of campus that way rather than being in giant lecture halls all the time. \n\nI wish you all the best, no matter what you decide. Tech isn\u2019t easy and you\u2019re already this far, but you also shouldn\u2019t sacrifice your own mental health. Good luck.",

But that doesn\u2019t really work. For one thing, that group will break up at some point, likely sooner than you think, and if you\u2019re not actually close to anyone in it you\u2019ll be back at square one with no friends. Going to a club or joining a frat isn\u2019t going to actually create the closeness you\u2019re probably seeking unless you actually make an effort to build relationships with the people there. Otherwise you will have no more socialization than the obligatory \u201cgroup events\u201d that everyone in the club is invited to and even those may not be super fun if you don\u2019t really talk to anyone there. They can be a good jumping off point, but you should focus more on individual friendships. Don\u2019t be trying to get in with that big, loud group - they all already have lots of friends. In stead, go somewhere *consistently* - it doesn\u2019t really matter where, club, gym, study sport, can all work - and try to have a conversation with someone there. Again, not someone who is part of a big group, just someone who is alone or with one other person say and who is there regularly. Then when you find someone you enjoy talking to, ask them if they\u2019ll be back, get their number, make plans, etc. It\u2019s also likely this new friend had a friend or two who you can now also make friends with.",

The design   states \"Georgia School of Technology\", as it was named until 1948.\n\nEdit: I will add that the small round shape on the bottom is the City of Atlanta Resurgens seal with the phoenix, the top round shape is the seal of the State of Georgia, and the image in the middle might be a representation of either the Greek Hephaestus or the Roman Vulcan, both gods of blacksmiths, metalworking, carpentry, etc. and thus technology in general.",

They're all going to the same city, so they decide to split a rental car instead of sleeping in the airport and waiting until the next day.\n\nAfter a 6 hour drive, all 3 are tired, it's almost midnight, they have several more hours to go, and the rain keeps getting worse. In need of rest, and with a long way to go to the next town, they finally decide to stop at a random farmhouse and ask if they can spend the night there.\n\nThe farmer is happy to welcome them, but only has room for 2 people, and the third will have to sleep in the barn where he keeps his animals. They reluctantly agree, with one of the two Tech fans in the barn and the other two guys inside.\n\nAfter half an hour, someone knocks on the farmer's front door - it's the man from the barn, who says he's a Hindu, and he can't share a room with a cow as they are sacred in his religion. He switches spots with one of the guys staying inside.\n\nAnother half hour later, he also bangs on the door - he's a devout Jew and doesn't want to be near a pig since they're \"unclean animals\". The farmer is getting annoyed and tells the 3rd guy to switch places. Now the two Tech fans are together in the house with the UGA fan in the barn.\n\nLater there's yet another knock on the door, it's the pig.",

(Assuming you are referring to OMED's Challenge Program)\n\nThey will definitely let you leave if you have an emergency, but you won't really get days off, only hours. If you have to leave, you'd need to contact your assigned counselor and let them know what's up.\n\nChallenge is a very intense program that simulates a 12 credit hour late summer short semester, meaning 4 classes over the course of a month. On weekends, there will be lots of activities you will be required to attend, from volunteer work to career development to company field trips. In fact, we usually did a full career day with several company executives visiting. I don't know if it's still done, but we also did white water rafting and a talent show every year. I think the students also got one weekend off to study for finals, but that's about it.\n\nWith all of that plus classes to keep up with, your schedule will likely be so full you wouldn't have time to go home.\n\nI'd recommend contacting OMED and see if they can give you the full schedule of activities so you can plan.\n\nHope this helps!",

The person I spoke with made it seem you won\u2019t be able to choose your roommates, room, building, floor, anything. I was specifically told they\u2019d assign us as they see fit to make fall move in easier. They said that the two places we signed on the housing contract about self assign basically aren\u2019t applicable. \n\nI\u2019m posting here because when I asked where this info was released I was told they did not post anywhere, and I find it very disingenuous to make a major change like this without notifying anyone. I\u2019m just sorry I didn\u2019t know about this when I filled out the housing form.\n\nIf I have any incorrect information I\u2019m happy to edit the post, just going off housing help desk correspondance.\n\nEdit: for context I\u2019m a junior BS student, no clue what\u2019s going on with ignite or for grad students",

Currently targeting April 9th-11th, but the final / official dates will be emailed soon.\n\nEdit: To clarify, incoming first-year dates and process will look a little different. You'll get program specific  information soon.\n\nApologies for the delay - long day. There are a few reasons why there might be some confusion:\n\n* If your fall assignment is in one of the buildings that will be open this summer, we will pre-assign you to your future fall space, so you will not have to move at the end of the summer\n* Similarly, if your current spring assignment is in a building that will be open for the summer, we will pre-assign you to your current room\n* These steps will be taken in that order and before the self-assign period begins (so someone else can't take your room). You can technically change it during self-assign, but... please don't\n* For all other returning students, self-assign is tentatively scheduled for April 9th - 11th, but we will email out more info and confirmed dates soon\n* **If you are a grad living over at Tenth and Home this summer**... you will not have a self-assign period. There are major projects happening in that area, and multiple buildings will be offline. Our team will assign the very few spaces that are available in the most efficient way possible. These students have been heavily communicated with over the last few months though -  I think the initial communication about the project and it's upcoming impact went out like a year and a half ago. Family residents should have received an email today about their assignment, and individual grads should receive their assignment email tomorrow.\n\nI'll speak with our team tomorrow to make sure we're communicating correct information.\n\nHope that helps - let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nCC: u/International_Air561, u/Classily_Classless",

The prox chip can be cloned pretty easily (I've done it before). So can the magstrip on the card. And when BuzzCards used to have a barcode printed on them, well... those were pretty easy to clone too.\n\nHowever, to my knowledge... the MIFARE DESFire EV2/3 chips have not been compromised, hacked, or cloned to date. Some of the older chip technologies designed in like 2002 have been hacked, but not the latest ones. The new door access system uses these DESFire chips.\n\nI had other security improvements in mind when I mentioned it, but this is a good one too.",

Also, I'm not certain if this is allowed to be posted, so I do apologize mods.\n\nSince the beginning of fall semester, It's been extremely tough for me.\n\nI had a bad breakup of two years where I invested everything into it. I dropped everyone for her, and suffocated her due to it. I wanted to spend 24/7 with her, and once she left, I had noone and nothing to be happy about anymore. She's since found someone new, which also now crushes my heart even further, that someone can move on just like that. My view of love is that I'm willing to work through anything with someone and dedicate everything to them, but parts of that view is just so twisted, as much of it is rooted in insecurities and selfishness. I never changed during the relationship, and only is changing somewhat now.\n\nI also feel so behind compared to my peers, and feel like I haven't made any meaningful relationships since I've been admitted. I've tried clubs, talking to people in my classes, and continuously pursued contact with the people I've already met, but I still feel like I'm just slowly suffocating myself to death. I've tried care, but It kind of was a repeat of everything I've tried, being the typical do new things meet new people, but I just don't feel like I connect with anyone. Everything above has been a detriment to my mental health, and my overall motivation, and I feel like I'm just spiraling out of controlling right now.\n\nI really feel so alone right now... I really don't know what else to do at the moment. This spring break has been just reminiscing about the time I spent with her, but she loves someone else now. It's been around half a year now, and I just feel like I'm slowly killing myself.\n\nOn the topic of meeting someone new, I've had a few girls ask for my number, but my heart just doesn't sit right with it. It feels like I don't click with any specific one of them either. This isn't the love that I imagined as a child... My heart hurts so much :)\n\nI know I haven't matured yet, but if this is maturing, I don't want it. I want a childish kind of love, but It feels so hard to love anyone else at the moment... I know my mistakes, but I can't change them anymore. I need to move forward, but It's been so difficult.\n\nIs anyone down to talk or give me some tips? I'm really sorry if this doesn't belong here haha.",

It seems your identity was her and now you need to find who you are.\n\nEveryone feels behind all the time - I promise you are not alone there. Instead of comparing yourself to others, evaluate how you feel about your progress. What are your goals at Tech (I hope to get an education)? Write down your goals and hang them somewhere. Remind yourself of those goals and that those are what you work towards, not being like someone else or \"catching up to peers\". Honestly, when guys give me trouble is when I work the hardest on my grades/other goals.\n\nSoon all this will pass and you will find someone else. In the meantime, find contentment in singleness (and don't feel pressure to get in a relationship either, I joke that there is no reason to settle until you are at least 30 :)).\n\nIf you are religious at all I'll leave you with this: God has a plan for your life. All you need to do now is sit back and let him take control. Don't worry about tomorrow because he's got it all.\n\nPraying for you.",

That I should go to clubs, go to parties, go to bars. I just don't know why, but I don't want to do any of that. it doesn't sit with me morally, and I'd prefer if the one I love doesn't do so either. It's an immature look at things, I know.\n\nI also wished I was religious. She was too and I regrettably mocked her for it because of how immature I was. Because of my athiesm, I am a nihilist, and just want to make the person I'm with happy in the end. \n\nOverall, I think my mindset needs a complete change. I'm just a bit sad right now still.

Work to build a future for yourself and the people you care about now (maybe parents or siblings). If this doesn't work, maybe money isn't your goal. Do you want to help people? Maybe you want to make a product to help people of a certain demographic?\n\nHere were some of the goals I made for myself before I even got on campus - granted some of them are kind of silly given I was young, but still:\n\n1. Make someone smile everyday\n2. Trust God in everything\n3. Do my best in my classes\n4. Stand up for my beliefs\n5. Participate in research\n\nI actually still have those as well as some new ones I have added saved to my desktop so I see them everyday.\n\nAs for your other things:\n\nDon't feel pressured to go to bars or clubs or anything like that. Anytime anyone tells me to do that I just say \"No thanks, I'm not into that stuff\". That is not an immature point of view at all. I much prefer having real, meaningful conversations over loud music and drunkenness.\n\nI know you say you aren't religious, but surprisingly many of your morals seem to align with religion.\n\nYou can completely ignore this next part, but I just wanted to put it out there in case you have been feeling this way: Sometimes we just need to hit the bottom before we can realize the truth. Even though you have gone through rough times, God is waiting for you with open arms. No matter what you have done or how lost you may think you are, he forgives and he loves you. Unlike humans who come and go, God will never leave you. I have also gone through some rough patches where I have felt completely alone, and those are the times I grew closest to my religion. If you want to discuss religion at all let me know. You seem to be questioning, that's why I bring it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd for your internships, you're a second-year - go for it!

I realized I started them to impress her, but should really start attending again haha.\n\nI really did wish God was real, but I'll be honest, I'll never believe. I'm too rooted in reality. I really did wish there was a heaven. We had a plush daughter named Bunbun. She has since then told me that Bunbun is just a plush, and that Bunbun matters nothing to her anymore, but I can't take her back because it'll just remind me of her. I hope she went to plushie heaven... I don't want her to suffer on this earth anymore.\n\nI'm so weird. I've tried all of the methods to move on. It's really not helping right now.

Similar to a sport, Aristotle believed that good morals and values need to be developed over time. By forcing yourself to be generous, you will eventually develop that trait and start acting that way naturally. Many Asian philosophers shared in this perspective as well.

                    "body": "I want to start off my saying your feelings are completely valid to have. That\u2019s not just \u201ctherapist talk\u201d, that\u2019s the truth. You invested a large chunk of yourself into this relationship and now that it\u2019s gone, it has you feeling lonely, dejected, and betrayed. Those are all normal feelings to have after a breakup. How do I know this? Because I went through the exact same thing you\u2019re going through. Literally, it is almost exactly the same. I had a relationship of two years, invested everything I had and more, thought I was going to marry this girl. Then sophomore fall comes along and she breaks up with me to start dating someone else. Reading your post is almost verbatim exactly what I experienced. \n\nThat said, I\u2019ll comment here, but if you want to talk in more detail, my dms are always open.\n\nI want to try to address each of your points in the order you wrote them, and then give my opinion and how I got through it. It\u2019s going to sound harsh, especially right now, but you need to hear it. I always want to emphasis that you won\u2019t get better right away. It\u2019ll take time. Even more time than you have already given it.\n\n\n\u201cI invested everything into it. I dropped everyone for her. I wanted to spend 24/7 with her\u2026\u201d \n\nit sounds like you already know this, but I want you to recognize that this is not how relationships should work. I\u2019m sure you let her keep her friendships, but then, whenever you tried to hang out with your friends, she complained about not spending time with her, so you slowly started to ignore your friends. That\u2019s not how relationships work. You should be allowed time for your personal friends (and relationships) and she should be allowed time for her friends (and relationships). Note: relationships does not mean romantic. Hopefully, this breakup will show you that this is an unhealthy/toxic relationship trait. Although, it might take a few more months to recognize this.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s since found someone new\u2026she can just move on like that.\u201d \n\nIf there\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned, is that girls don\u2019t just \u201cmove on.\u201d She most likely had ended the relationship mentally weeks before. Note: this is just my personal experience, yours may vary. But, I could tell something was up weeks before I got broken up with. I just didn\u2019t imagine it would lead to us breaking up. So, take a hard look at the last few weeks of the relationship and see if she seemed more distant, or if arguments suddenly stopped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to work through anything\u2026and dedicate everything to them.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re religious, but something that helped me, after talking to my priest, is the idea that God should be your number one relationship. That your relationships should point to God and not dominate God. What this means, is that you should feel the way you described towards God, and then lesser towards your mortal relationships. If you\u2019re not religious, take it like this: relationships shouldn\u2019t take precedence over your own well-being. They should only enhance it. (Obviously there will be times when they do not, but that does not necessarily mean they are bad relationships.)\n\n\u201cI feel so behind.\u201d\n\nI got C\u2019s and honestly didn\u2019t even care about school for the entire fall semester after the breakup. It\u2019s normal to lose all interest in school. Maybe consider taking a semester long break to rediscover yourself. But I honestly, would advise against it.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t made any meaningful connections\u201d\n\nConnections are hard to make. It\u2019s relatively easy to talk with people. More difficult to deepen those connections. All I can say to this is keep trying. Some of my best friends were people I had only passing contact with for an entire semester until the last week, then we got super close super fast, and completely unexpectedly. Honestly, and I am being 100% honest, download hinge, bumble, (maybe not tinder), and go on dates, or even just text people. Don\u2019t look for anything (not hookups, not relationships), just go and talk with people. Use it as a way to get to know people and ask people more personal questions, even if they don\u2019t lead to anything. Use it as a place to try and develop deeper connections, because that\u2019s kinda the point of them. Listen to the podcast \u201cPeople I mostly admire\u201d no. 126. It\u2019s about having deep conversations. \n\n\u201cThink about Time spent with her\u201d\n\nMost importantly, stop doing that. She is out of your life now. She is not coming back. Don\u2019t try to Gatsby your way out of this. It\u2019s not going to happen. That was the hardest part for me. There\u2019s this sort of glory or honor that you can trap yourself into, thinking it\u2019s honorable to wait for her. Don\u2019t do that. There\u2019s nothing honorable about making yourself feel terrible. \n\n\u201cHad a few girls ask for my number\u201d\n\nThe good news is\u2026you\u2019re still attractive! And I\u2019m going to be honest, after the breakup, I didn\u2019t really start to deeply connect with girls until about 2 years later. I had hookups and flings that I was attracted to and cared for, but none of them that I \u201cloved\u201d. And I got called out on it by one of them. It took me a long time to feel comfortable, to feel safe to open up again and give myself the opportunity to be hurt again. My guess is the reason you don\u2019t \u201cclick\u201d with them is because you\u2019re either 1) comparing them to her. 2) are afraid to be vulernable because the last time you were, you got betrayed. Or 3) both. It takes time to heal, so don\u2019t expect to get right back into another deep relationship immediately. Find a way to let yourself be loved, and to love others. It\u2019s easier if you make yourself vulnerable to your friends first. Also, Ted Lasso has unironically good examples of mantras and mental health for men.\n\n\u201cI want a childish kind of love\u201d\n\nThe good news is, childish love still exists. But you have to choose to have it, and that requires being vulnerable. What is a childish love? It\u2019s a love that loves 100% without fear for the consequences. If you are afraid of the consequences, you will never have a childish love. It\u2019s easier when it\u2019s (I\u2019m assuming) your first relationship. Harder once you\u2019ve been hurt. But you have to give yourself time to heal, otherwise it won\u2019t get better. It took me 2 years to heal. But each day was a little bit easier.\n\nOkay, I think that answered your things. Now to talk about my experience.\n\nIt hurt. It really really hurt. For a long time. More than I\u2019m willing to admit. I wasn\u2019t necessarily suicidal, but I wasn\u2019t really enjoying life. I had a panic attack after seeing her driving with her new man. The panic attack was terrifying (but I did go and hit a bench press PR afterwards that took another year to hit). The point is, healing takes time. I wasn\u2019t back to 100% until 2 years later. But, I was back to 50% by about the 6 month mark. And 80% after about a year. I think you might be in a similar boat. There\u2019s good days and there\u2019s bad days. And I think it will probably take the same length of the relationship before you\u2019re finally fully over it.\n\nThings that helped me. Going to the gym (cliche). Im still there every morning at 6am. It doesn\u2019t have to be weightlifting, but gaining some muscle is always beneficial for confidence. It also doesn\u2019t have to be the gym (although I strongly recommend getting in shape), it could be art, poetry, writing, paintball. Do something with your newfound time. Learn something. Friends are helpful. I know you\u2019re struggling to find them, but lean on anyone you have. Parents, family, siblings, etc. Stop following them on social media. Seriously. Nothing beneficial will come from seeing their life without you in it. They didn\u2019t want you in it, so don\u2019t try to keep up with them. There\u2019s no reason to. \n\nGoing back to Ted Lasso, don\u2019t watch \u201csigma male movies\u201d like blade runner with Ryan gosling or American psycho. Those just mess with your mental state.\n\nI want you to know, it does get easier, and eventually you will get over her. I\u2019m living proof. I\u2019m now finally getting into another fulfilling relationship, and it feels amazing. But, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without finally allowing myself to open up and be vulnerable.\n\nMy dms are always open if you want to talk or hear more about my experience. Feel free to interrogate me!\n\nAlso, watch [this](https://youtu.be/ZQht2yOX9Js?si=dsdAMenN0RRJM64k).",

You need to move on before trying to be with someone new. Instead of trying to heal your wound with others, you need to heal yourself first.\n\nEveryone will say these things, but instead of trying to socialize with people you don't enjoy being with, you can set hobbies and goals for yourself. You should do things that will keep your mind busy, or you can prevent yourself from thinking too much by exercising and tiring yourself out. Whenever I don't occupy myself with something, I always think about depressive and negative things. But whenever I keep myself busy, these thoughts never come to me. I'm not saying you should keep yourself so busy that you die of exhaustion, but you should find something to devote yourself to. \n\nFrom what I see, you're attempting to commit yourself to a person, and that might not be the best course of action. I believe that by prioritizing your own happiness first, you'll eventually encounter someone whom you'll love again. Instead of seeking someone to make you happy, focus on creating your own happiness first. Then, aim to find someone who will complement and share in your happiness.\n\nBy the way, I think that childish love is something you can experience no matter how old you are. Also I'm slightly older than most of the current college students and doing undergrad here and I cannot connect anyone in my classes. I enjoy talking to them but it is never a deep level connection.

Lots of people my age have finished school and some are even starting families. Coming from another country, where relationships mean a lot, it's tough here where everything feels kind of shallow. Maybe it's just part of growing up, or maybe it's because English isn't my first language, but it feels like this language makes everything less real. It's been getting me down, and I've been keeping to myself more. I'd rather have a few real friends than lots of superficial ones. Most of my interactions now just feel like small talk.\n\nBut even with all this, I find moments of happiness when I can accept how things are right now. Sure, there are days when I can't quite do that, but I'm learning to just wait for those feelings to pass. But honestly I always feel like I'm always waiting for something to be happy. For example I think I will be happier when I graduate, I think I will do this and do that when I graduate. Or I think when I have a meaningful relationship I assume I will be happier. But this is all wrong. I think happiness is just in the small things but we still spend all of our live waiting for to be happy. \n\nMaybe you should just give some time to yourself to feel these feelings little bit. It is okay to feel lost. There hasn't been a time in the last 4 years that I haven't felt lost. \n\nI'm wondering, what were the things that made you happy before you got into a relationship with her?",

You aren't a weasel looking for a mate, you are a person who needs to be his own person who can be stable on YOUR OWN.\n\n\n2. This girl is a drop in the bucket of your life, and you won't think about her for a second when you find the person you are really supposed to be with. Holding onto something dead is like holding onto something dead, it is dead. You will only find happiness by finding your true love, which starts with yourself.\n\n\nNo stable woman will want to date someone who is nothing without them, so stop looking to latch.

I can't change what I haven't started. I'm behind lot of students here, but I've made it my goal to start somewhere and achieve small goals and slowly change/modify them to achieve larger goals.\n\nThe same applies to making friends. I struggle with friendships too, but I'm forcing myself to get into various things. I make time to attend various events and just try to enjoy them either myself or with the people there, without expecting to form any friendships because quite honesty I might not see these people again. Biggest thing I'd say is get into things your interested in and can do by yourself, and do them consistently. This way you can connect with other people over shared interests and start forming friendships.\n\nI'm not a therapist, but if you need a friend, I'm always down to meet on campus and have lunch, no pressure! I've been meeting people from this subreddit here and there and its helping me get over my anxiety of meeting new people and helping me feel less lonely :)",

Just remember to be kind to yourself and take it at your own pace, you have to remember you have so much life ahead of you, and it\u2019s okay to take your own time. I\u2019d also recommend going fully no contact with your ex as well, it\u2019s not that you stopped loving her, but it\u2019s for your healing considering how codependent y\u2019all were for each other. \n\nWhile you do all that, just make sure you do things FOR yourself, no one else. Maybe it\u2019s join an IM sport, go work out, read more books, watch more movies, etc. Ideally something that gets you actively engaged and piquing your own interests.\n\nYou\u2019ll make your way out of this maze eventually, the problem is that for a lot of people, they think that \u201ceventually\u201d means months or weeks when it could be years. You got out of a LONG relationship, that shit will stick in your heart forever. Just keep the faith and love and forgive yourself and you\u2019ll make it.\n\nYou can also DM me if you\u2019re comfortable with that. We could chat or get coffee if you\u2019d like.",

It\u2019s normal to feel down or even enter a temporary acute depression for a bit after a breakup, particularly when\u00a0it defines a large portion of who you are. Humans aren\u2019t meant to have that much of their personal identity ripped away from them, especially when they\u2019ve only just started figuring out who they are. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you.\n\nYou can (and will) 100% bounce back. It\u2019s really really really hard to imagine that things will be okay. But they kinda just\u2026 will eventually. You\u2019ll meet closer friends (even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it now), find more things you enjoy, and start doing things that give you purpose. Your brain will slowly make sense of what\u2019s happening, re-anchor itself, and heal. And slowly, but surely, you\u2019ll start feeling happy and you\u2019ll get back to normal. It might take many months, but it\u2019s a process. Humans are beautifully resilient creatures.\n\nBut, a part of that process above is taking the time to think about what happened rationally (or at least not shut down your feelings). You might not feel rational now, and that\u2019s okay. You might try a thousand different frameworks of thought, and that\u2019s okay. But eventually, you\u2019ll need to be honest with yourself and process everything. It\u2019s easier to forget than it looks.\n\nYou\u2019ll be good, although it might take awhile to start to see that. No matter what happens, everything will be okay. If you want to talk, dm me (although I only use reddit when I\u2019ve got a specific question, so I might take a bit to respond lol).\u00a0",

Congratulations, you're already at the top of the first mountain - you recognize that you have a flawed view of relationships. A lot of people never recognize this, and you should be encouraged by this all because this is a profound growth opportunity for you.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a good therapist, and stick with it. Work through this stuff. It may not feel like it's helping at times, but you're young and have time for things to click. You just need to put in the self-work and ultimately a lot of these issues will probably be okay.\n\nSide-note: As an adult (31 as of this past week), one of the biggest things I recognize in peers my age, and even in myself, is that a lot of people still struggle setting boundaries for themselves and for others around them. Boundaries, and communicating them properly and clearly, are really important - they are what we use as safeguards to our peace and serenity in life. It's important to be very conscious of how you set and maintain them, and you need to be paying attention to how often you shift the goalposts on these boundaries (super common mistake the make out of guilt).\n\nYou'll come to find that if you work on boundaries and communication that it will ultimately put you far ahead of the curve emotionally, but also in your career. Good luck. You're going to figure it out! :)",

I've had many close longterm friendships die by being dropped like unwanted coal. I'm also struggling mightily to connect with ppl in college, especially at Tech. If I allow myself to think about it too much I start bawling, and I don't cry normally. I pray we both find the connections we yearn for and need.\n\nVolunteering can help. So can just making someone else smile. Turning your focus on the problems and needs of others can sometimes put yours in perspective, I suppose, though I personally believe we all have battles to fight (though some may not seem like battles to others). Helping someone else can bring a purpose and joy more longstanding than any temporary, fleeting smile.\n\nEdit: I've read a few of your replies. You seem to really be struggling, and an adamant atheist to boot. I'm not going to preach at you, bc I doubt it will be heard. Several other commentors have worded things well already, and I don't know your beliefs well enough to speak to you directly. But. I know God is real bc I'm not dead yet, and many other reasons besides. I also know that He has to step back and let us try, and fail, and grow and develop. We can't be flat Mary Sues, as the literary equivalents of never failing are known. It freakin hurts too. A relationship and belief in him isn't a get through life easy card. It's a steadfast rock of love to cry on sometimes, and stand proudly on in others.",

This is my second semester, and academics-wise I'm doing fine, 4.0 GPA but that may change due to mental health issues and burnout.\n\nGonna be blunt, I just don't like the vibes here. Everyone's always too busy to go out, studying, working on their homework with their headphones on, etc etc. How do you meet people? What do you do after you're done working? Why aren't there more social events and mixers? The only way I made friends here is through clubs or approaching them in public (which is hard because everyone is always hurrying to their next class :/ )\n\nI mean don't get me wrong, there are fun people that do club activities but, those are usually once a week and it's really hard to form proper connections. You try to meet them outside of club hours, and everyone's busy with work. The only really sociable people I met were from frats, but a lot of them tended to have very toxic mindsets, especially towards girls, which I didn't like. I didn't know frats were a thing before coming to the US lol\n\nSpeaking of girls, how are you supposed to meet girls here?? I only dated 1 girl here so far, and I met her at a mixer during welcome week. I know that as a guy, I'm supposed to approach girls and be proactive but, how am I supposed to do that when all girls do here is study with their headphones on?\n\nI'm staying off campus very close to tech square. There are tons of amenities like a swimming pool, outdoors seatings, lots of rooms and screens that you might use to watch movies or play games. But noone uses them, they're always empty lmao. I guess people prefer to stay home and study. I want to know, is the situation better if you live on campus? Do the RA-s organize weekly social events? They used to do that at my previous college.\n\nWhat should I do? All of this + classes + pressure to find a job + TA work has been too much, and I'm cracking. My family noticed that I am depressed and burnt out. Having a gf really helped, cus I had someone I could see every day, but now I don't even have that haha.\n\nDo I change housing? Get a car and find friends at meetups and bars? Transfer? And if so, where? What colleges have a better work/life balance? Preferably with a smaller campus where I'd be living close to my friends and seeing them every day",

Can you reach out to people you sit beside in your classes for a study session? Then, that can turn into one on one or group activities if you have similar interests. Can you go to a club that\u2019s interesting to you and make a plan to study or hang out with those friends, too?\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult for some to maintain relationships when they don\u2019t occupy the same spaces as their friends. The people here are really great, but a lot of times, you\u2019ve got to reach out first- which can take a mental and emotional toll after a while.

We try to make plans, but someone always has homework, or needs to grade papers, or whatever the heck else. Also, the people in CS are very standoffish. I tried talking to them but most of them just look at you weird. That's probably why almost all of my friends are outside of CS.\n\nI've also been trying to get people to work on projects together on edstem and group chats, but noone answers lol.\n\nI want to transfer to a school with a smaller campus, where I can hang out with friends every day. I just can't here, I'm going insane, and it's turning me into a sad, depressed person. My old friend's can't recognize me.",

It\u2019s a super welcoming club and as a strange human myself I personally felt included and really enjoy getting to know everyone in the club!\n\nThe club meets four days a week (you choose however many days you want to go to) and post-practice meals are very common. There\u2019s also planned social events and trips that people go on together. I\u2019ve also seen plenty of YJAC people hanging out outside of the club, so there\u2019s plenty of that. \n\nI think orientations are done for this semester (only four-ish weeks left), but over the summer / next fall you can totally join if you\u2019re looking for a club that does stuff outside the club itself!\n\nAs for relationships, I can\u2019t help you there lol. But if you\u2019re interested, feel free to reply in thread or DM me about archery! It\u2019s a great club!",

Half of the population of Georgia is in Atlanta and SO many super qualified kids don't get in and end up going to OOS top tier schools instead.  This equals lots of mad parents and alumni.\n\nTheir solution is to increase transfers and increase freshman class size which puts increased strain on all areas, rather than increase in state percentage. Money is a small part of this but not the whole picture.\n\nA huge portion of the \"biggest school in the state\" is online masters programs where people don't step foot on campus and there is no infrastructure pressure so that is a little misleading.",

But then it's also wanting to get more rural students, more women, more students of color (without reducing the other cohorts), also as more students go towards stem degrees (nationwide), those colleges are in higher demand, plus Atlanta overall being a bigger destination for people worldwide...plus (and this is a softer stat) but they need to keep georgia politicians happy and those guys get really riled up with their kid with the 3.8 gpa doesn't get in and they can't figure out why. \nwith all that said, I'd keep the enrollment small and let the growth happen at other state colleges. (to contrast, MIT only has 5000 undergrads though its a bit deceptive to write that as 65% of their enrollment are grad students)",

This in turn allows us to attract and hire top tier talent, not just at the facility level but also for positions like president. \n\nCriticism of such fast growth is well known and acutely felt at all levels: not enough instructors, not enough classrooms, not enough lab space for research, etc. I would agree we're growing too fast.

Let's close Ferst, Hemphill, and possibly the bits of 8th and 9th inside campus to most cars, allowing access  only for deliveries, maintenance vehicles, and some special circumstances. The shuttles been be replaced by a nice efficient tram, while the parking lot underneath Klaus can be converted into 3 floors of desperately-needed CS classroom space! Other parking lots could also be put to more productive uses.\n\nI know it's crazy, but how hard would it be? Doing this would reduce pollution and noise, incentivise public transport use, improve safety, and make the overall campus ambiance more friendly!",

There have been many votes on increasing Marta and the like, and they are almost always a landslide against spending money on it. Georgia culture is a commuter culture, and asking for that to change is not easily accomplished. Thus, by reducing commuter options, you are really advocating for making professors, janitors, administrators, etc experience more difficulty in getting to their job. I agree reducing campus congestion is a noble goal, but the community it affects the most negatively are the people that make this school great every single day",

Removing parking and driving options from campus is objectively a bad idea. We have an incredibly walkable campus and a lot of options for getting elsewhere. There\u2019s no reason to make changes. Besides, you\u2019re the one who said \u201clive closer to campus\u201d. So does it apply to me, or not?",

We talked about one of his projects, which I think was really interesting and it's related to my experience. He said I was a good fit for the project.\n\n\u00a0I was accepted into Georgia Tech PhD in robotics program and I applied through the mechanical engineering department. I don't think he's super familiar with how the mechanical engineering phd in robotics admission works since he's in the Aerospace department. When we started talking about funding he noticed that he had previously assumed that I already have a GRA. He already sent out 3-4 offers to students and he basically said I\u2019m not sure if I have funding for you, it depends on whether those students accept the offer, so he would have a better idea around April 10. He said worst case I would have to TA for a semester.\u00a0\n\nDo you have any advice on what I should\u00a0do? His lab was one of my top picks.",

In my time as a student I've done a few SWE internships and, while I generally enjoyed the experience, it was hard to imagine myself doing that \"forever\" (even admitting that an internship is far from the intensity of a full-time career.) \n\nAs a result, I want to take a crack at undergrad research and see what the world of research and potentially academia are like. Seeing as I've still yet to complete my junior design option I'm seriously considering the research option as opposed to, say, working on a VIP. I had a few questions for anyone who has done the research option as a result:\n\n1) Did you find the research option useful to you long term? Would you have preferred to do a more industry focused choice like project-based/VIP?  \n2) Did you pursue grad school directly after graduation, or did you go into the workforce?   \n3) What was the outcome of the research option like for you? Was it just \\~9 hours of research work or did it result in anything like a journal publication, conference presentation, etc.?  \n4) And most importantly... do you recommend the research option for someone looking to try someone new?\n\nThoughts and answers to any of these questions would be greatly appreciated.

                    "body": "Currently in the middle of the research option, so I can't speak entirely to the end results. Having said that:\n\n1. The research option has proven to be reasonably helpful. It's certainly helped me enhance my technical writing skills (which imo everyone should have decent experience with in today's industry). I'm personally leading my own research under faculty advisement (through UROP), which is why I prefer it to group-based project options like CREATE-X, VIP, or capstone. I know most research options involve joining a lab, though you could always try reaching out to a faculty if there's a particular project you had in mind.\n2. I'm planning to pursue grad school more or less immediately after undergrad (planning to take a 7-month gap for one semester + the summer, as I'm graduating in a fall semester)\n3. I did 3 hours of research for another research team in my freshman year. Last summer, I did the asynchronous proposal writing class. This semester and last have been research semesters for my project. I'm taking the asynchronous thesis writing class this summer. The goal is to finish data collection this semester/this summer, spend the summer writing my thesis, and have it published in a journal by the summer.\n4. The research option is not for the faint of heart, especially UROP - it requires a lot more independence than capstone or VIP might (no idea how CREATE-X compares tbh). Having said that, if you're disciplined with your time management and commitments, when else are you going to have the chance to just casually try out research like this? Make sure you're working on something you're actually passionate about (don't just join/start a research project if you're not at all interested in it, as it gets a lot tougher to try and stay engaged).\n\nOverall, I can definitely recommend the research option (especially UROP). Be mindful of it and don't do it just to try \\*something\\* new. But if research is something you really want to try and you're passionate about or interested in the subject at hand: why not give it a shot? Ultimately, it's a choice based on your interests, your own time management/discipline, and your plans for the future (grad school, etc.) I've really enjoyed it\n\nP.S.

I'm definitely planning on pursuing grad school directly after graduation. Like you, I haven't been overly enthused with software engineering so far (I want to spend my life solving hard, research-style problems instead of developing infrastructure or managing some kubernetes cluster). I honestly really love the research we do and working in the lab is probably the first thing I could actually clearly see myself doing \"forever,\" so grad school is the natural next step.\n\n3. I basically spent my first two semester just learning a LOT. I work in AI/controls and there are some incredibly math-heavy papers and unfamiliar concepts that I had to understand to get up to speed. I didn't spend as much time on research during those two semesters (maybe 6-ish hours a week) as I do now (closer to 15). In retrospect, I probably could've started working on projects after less time learning; but, I wanted a deeper understanding of the field and the grad students who've been mentoring me were happy to support me through that! \n\nThis semester, I'm getting paid and starting to really work on paper-able projects. I'll likely have a not-first author paper out soon as I'm helping a grad student run experiments. I'm leading a few projects which will hopefully yield a first-author publication (or two) sometime later this year. Ultimately, I plan on continuing to conduct research for the remainder of my time at Tech and I'd conservatively expect to publish maybe 4-5 papers (1-2 of which are first-author). This is just my prediction based on very limited experience, though!\n\n4. Yes! I tried research semi-arbitrarily tbh, but I've fallen in love. I love the team that I work with and the new things that I learn and I'm excited to start publishing to get something out there! \n\nHowever, it should be mentioned that research is hard and time-consuming. You get what you put into it. Each three-credit class is meant to be 9 hours of work per week, and you probably won't gain much unless you put in somewhere around that, on average. How your research goes is entirely up to you. You could spend the entire time learning nothing, not asking questions and barely understanding a paper or two, or, you could publish several papers and truly engage yourself in the lab (even in just those three semesters / nine credits). \n\nHow much work you're willing to put into \"something new\" is up to you!",

Independent research shows above and beyond that you are a self-starter. That's the kind of person you want to hire in the entry-level: someone who can take a directive and largely figure it out without hand-holding (while not being so stubborn not to ask questions when blockers arise). \n\nSpeaking of \"something new\".... One of the students that worked with me years ago primarily did research on learning AI for fighting games by monitoring the game state in memory (I think, technically it was a bit above my head). A good advisor will let you go in the direction you are truly passionate about while giving you guidance to keep you focused on reaching the goals you set at the beginning of a semester. Choosing a subject you are genuinely interested in makes it feel like a relief from your regular classwork, rather than a burden. You'll need the right faculty fit for this approach. The best audition is taking a class taught by a faculty member you want to do research with, if possible.\n\nDon't focus on outcomes, focus on process. That being said, the bar to do a poster presentation is not very high and is a good entry point to publication as an undergrad. \"Presented at PRESTIGIOUS\\_CONFERENCE\" is good enough, poster presentation or no. Most people outside academia don't know the difference between a paper or poster, anyway.\n\nIf you plan to go to grad school, having faculty that can vouch for you is an incredible advantage. I know it carries admission weight, again largely because doing independent research shows you are a self-starter.",

They can just adjust grades with curves, or add too much material to be covered in an exam (like Sec+, or other Comptia tests), or go into too much detail with questions, or add too hard of questions to be completed within the time limit for an exam, etc. So grade inflation is likely a result of how classes are taught now, and schools' philosophy on how grading should work (e.g. only cover material seen, make extra effort to learn rewarded by a higher grade, etc.)\n\nI know that for OMSCS, at least, they are forcing us to learn mathematical proofs with a required algorithms class that uses them, and proofs are not in the curriculum. They also require a B average (3.0) to graduate, and B's or higher for classes in your specialization - so they can build the classes to require knowledge of certain topics to get a passing grade. I have already seen this in IIS, with problems worth 20% that cover a specific topic/exploit for a mini-project that distinguish between an 80% and 100% (straight, no curve, so a B or an A). So I can imagine them constructing overall classes this way as well, not just assignments.",

            "selftext": "Hi everyone! I wanted to share an exciting extracurricular leadership opportunity for those of you who are already involved in research.\u00a0Undergraduate Research Ambassadors (URA) is a peer mentoring organization within Georgia Tech's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program. The ambassadors help other students navigate the research process by holding weekly office hours and organizing events throughout the semester. Mentoring opportunities range from helping students join a lab to guiding them through the application process for scholarships like the President's Undergraduate Research Award (PURA).\u00a0Applications to join URA for Fall 2024 are currently open, and they will close next Sunday,\u00a0March 24th. The application consists of a streamlined form at this [link,](https://urop.gatech.edu/content/undergraduate-research-ambassador-guidelines-and-application) as well as a faculty recommendation\u00a0(which is also due on Sunday, March 24th). Feel free to check out our [website](https://urop.gatech.edu/content/undergraduate-research-ambassadors) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gt_ura/) for more information. I am currently an ambassador, so feel free to ask any questions, and I will do my best to answer them! ",

                            "body": "I am very sorry to hear about the ghosting! I think cold emailing is the most common way to join a lab, but there are plenty of other options. I personally joined a lab through a summer REU in a Georgia Tech lab, so I would suggest looking into some of those if you are free this summer. Even if it's not an official REU program, I have heard that joining a lab is easier in the summer because there are less people on campus. You can also reach out to a former class instructor that does research, since they are much less likely to ignore you if they know you personally. \n\nIf that doesn't help, I would suggest going to an undergraduate research fair/showcase, since a lot of lab PIs and grad students go to those because they *want* to recruit undergraduate students for their labs. You also get an added benefit of meeting potential PIs and grad students in-person rather than over email. URA hosts an undergraduate research fair every fall, but some departments have their own fairs, as well (I know mine does)\u2014so keep an eye out for networking events like that. There is also URA's annual [Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://calendar.gatech.edu/event/2024/04/16/undergraduate-research-spring-symposium) coming up next month, which will mostly have undergraduate students presenting, but there should be some professors there, as well. \n\nFinally, you can check out the Pair Me [website](https://pairme.aep.gatech.edu/); it is basically a database covering research and VIP opportunities at Georgia Tech, but unfortunately, I think most students don't know about it. Lots of labs put out job postings on there if they are looking for undergraduate students to help out in their lab. I hope this helps, and good luck!",

Both were less stressful than I expected and felt more like a conversation than an interview!\n\nSomething I *always* recommend is reading about the research projects in the lab you want to join before the interview, since it shows that you are interested in what they do. No one will expect you to know everything about your lab's area of expertise at this stage, but a little bit of preparation can go a long way! \n\nThe dress code honestly depends on context. Formal clothes would probably be best if you're interviewing for a very competitive REU, but if you're just meeting a professor you cold emailed, business casual will suffice. I personally wore dress pants and a nice blouse for both of my interviews. There is also nothing wrong with emailing the interview organizers to ask about the dress code.",

As others have said, Georgia Tech purposefully took specific action to prevent the very thing you are trying to do.   \n\nAs in, the college of computing already has sooo many students with sooo many other undergrads switching their majors to CS that they made the decision to eliminate this pipeline.\n\nThe best programmers I knew at Tech were EE or MATH majors anyway.   If you have your heart set on a career in programming then absolutely nothing is stopping you from taking many of the same classes that CS folks take, or unofficially auditing courses and learning the material yourself.\n\nMost companies who recruit CS from Tech will also consider CS adjacent majors.... the drawback is that the CMPE and EE curricula are tougher than CS.

The vendor has around 3,000 Banner  customers...where the ENTIRE University System of Georgia (USG) counts as ONE such customer.

A) Oracle has end-of-lifed the fundamental technology whereby web pages are rendered by stored procedures in the database. B) Ellucian is working to push all their clients into their SaaS (Software as a Service) universe -- which uses a PostgeSQL database (junking/replacing several million lines of Oracle PL/SQL in the process of escaping Oracle's egregious licensing fees).\n\nThe new product is written in Java -- with all the benefits and blemishes that implies.\n\nGeorgia Tech (and the USG) is almost a decade late in converting to Banner 9 registration.\n\nDoes that help?",

The class is pretty test heavy(i.e. the only things that affect the grade are the midterm and the final). I had studied so much, and came to class basically everytime, and even I helped a classmate who did well study. Even the professor was surprised I did so badly. I guess  it must have been an off day. I talked to my advisor and he suggested I drop the class. \n\nI understand that withdrawing from a class won't screw me over long term, especially considering that I have a high GPA in a hard major (AE) but I'm still feeling down about the fact that I dropped a class and have been in an emotional and mental slump for the past 24 hours.

Just because I did well in the past doesn\u2019t mean I get to rest on my laurels. Second, know when to call it quits. I had an insane courseload and really could\u2019ve used the extra study time elsewhere instead of wasting it failing for that second half of the semester.

I took the final, never got a score back, then final grades were posted and I made a C in the course. I emailed Kardomateas to ask for a bump and he said I made a 72 in the course and wasn\u2019t getting it. I guess you can do the math to figure out what I made on the final but I never bothered.\n\nMy advice is to not let it shake you. You\u2019re going to have good days and bad days, and you just got unlucky your bad day happened on a big midterm day. If my hunch is right that this was Kardomateas, I especially wouldn\u2019t let that sway you because he was an awful professor.",

This was before the expansion of both 75/85 (4 lanes/side then, 8 lanes/side now) and the street right in front of Turner (4 lanes then, 8 lanes now).  There was a motel at the north end and looking on [Historic Aerials](https://historicaerials.com/viewer), the strip was ~80 yards wide.",

Non-natives can also be disease vectors, require too much to maintain, like the massive quantities of water used in Arizona and other states to maintain lawns, not to mention the chemicals, and there are some non-natives that are downright invasive that displace our vital native plants. \n\nLoropetalum is a beautiful non-native. And all those beautiful azaleas that are synonymous with the South are non-natives as well. There is a native azalea called the Piedmont azalea, which is gorgeous but not nearly as widely used, probably because it is deciduous.",

BST Remove, Quicksort, etc.), you break it down into what each line of code is accomplishing, and write out that line. Then you turn that line-by-line description of the algorithm into a mnemonic device/acronym that you will memorize. The second you get that exam paper, write out the mnemonic device at the top right corner, and then reference it to make sure you don\u2019t miss a single step. If done correctly, even looking at the letter \u201cA\u201d will remind you to add the node to a list, or whatever. \n\nJust what worked for me, good luck!",

Usually, memorization will lead to a decent score, but will lead to errors on certain leetcode-like questions on the exam where memorizing certain algorithms could yield incorrect answers (Think the most recent BST challenge question). Instead understanding the algorithms before the exam then applying the technique used to create the algorithm will help you excel, and even help you become a better software engineer.\n\nIf you want a good idea on how to prep for the coding questions or maybe the multiple choice/diagramming, go to Office Hours and ask one of the TAs on duty to walk through how they take one on the practice exams or maybe a specific question from the exam. This way you are able to receive live feedback on your approach to solving the questions or maybe a learn a new way to tackle the questions on exams. Id be happy to walk through questions from the exam to show my thought process for some of the questions when I was taking it if you pull up to office hours or make a private post on piazza about it (my notifs r on so I can help ASAP if it's on there).\n\nI also suggest going to recitation the day before the exam. Depending on the TA, we will go over the process for solving common exam questions (usually on the worksheets we give out), maybe walk through a coding question, then take any questions regarding taking the exam or content that could be covered on the exam. Overall, just make sure to understand the topics in depth and situations where a certain algorithm might be applicable. Don't stress about it, you got this :)",

Write the code again from scratch by thinking through the logic ( do this in black pen) come back and fill in ur errors in another color and understand WHY u made those mistakes/forgot. Did you not understand the data structure construction? Was it silly syntax (like incrementing a size var)? Are u missing a concept you need to review (like recursion or pointer reinforcement)? Then keep writing it over and over again with the same process and you will begin to see patterns in where you struggle. For me it was recursion and pointer reinforcement but by the time the test rolled around I understood it. So to an extent you should have them memorized through logic bc of the time crunch if that makes sense? It\u2019s not brute force. But it involves memorizing.",

This is because \"normal\" maths is straightforward, one equality leads to another and after doing tedious algebra, you are done. However, in physics, you can \"skip\" a lot of steps usually. This usually means to observe a phenomenon, or realizing a physical fact, and you use it in your equality, which would not have been possible if  you didn't have an understanding of physics. Additionally, it is harder to set up initial equations in physics because you need to understand the problem. Luckily, you can study both the same way, do a lot of problems, redo them, and deeply think why the steps are true. I am sure the professors said it, but reading solution is not the same as doing problems.\n\nMath on a higher level changes a lot, and is much more interesting, you will see something in CS2050, but imo it is not the best taught/designed class. You should try doing upper level math if you find it easy.",

There will be about 500+ high school students from 32 schools competing that day. If you were involved with Science Olympiad in high school and would like to meet with other SciOly alumni, or if you would just like to come hang out, please consider joining us on tournament day. You do not need have been involved in Science Olympiad in middle or high school to volunteer. Just seeing kids excited about science is super duper rewarding!!\n\nIn particular, we are looking for general volunteers to support event supervisors. General volunteers can volunteer for any amount of hours on tournament day. If you are interested in being a general volunteer, please fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/VW1mSr58ucYUSnAq9). Pizza (around noon) and snacks all day will be provided to all volunteers along with a nifty t-shirt!\n\nIf you have any questions, please let us know at [scioly.gatech@gmail.com](mailto:scioly.gatech@gmail.com). Thanks for your support!",

Out of all possible places, a college campus with a big closed-loop street that takes up most of the route seems like the most effective place to have vehicles whose main issue is needing frequent charging stations and losing power in cold (e-buses) or needing long wire systems (trolleybuses).",

There's also the fact that electric buses are expensive and the current transportation fee wouldn't cover it. Public schools that got electric buses almost always had state or federal grants to foot the bill. Bringing electric buses to Tech would cost tens of millions. They're in PTS' roadmap but the funding isn't concrete and we won't get electric buses until we know where the money is coming from. \n\nTrolleybuses are another solution but the overhead wires are unsightly and I bet there are other reasons we don't see them on college campuses.",

I was so worried about the cars who sped RIGHT by me while I played ball with bumpy pavement. Likely didn't help that I was having some issues with my bike. Besides, you still have to rejoin the sidewalk eventually to get to most buildings, bike racks, etc. Pedestrians walk proudly down the center of all the mixed traffic sidewalks, so me carefully going down the right side of the sidewalk (and yielding to all pedestrians) really doesn't give me an ounce of guilt.",

By contrast, UIUC aero seems to be active in all spheres of aerospace engineering.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that GT is more of a rotorcraft-focused school, or am I missing something here? Can someone give an overview of the aerodynamics work at GT? Thanks!",

Although ASDL's main emphasis is not on compressible fluid dynamics, there are numerous opportunities to engage in projects related to CFD and high-speed aerodynamic design. However, ASDL has limited experimental capabilities as it is not their main focus.\n\nOn the other hand, as you mentioned, the Combustion Lab and the Computational Combustion Lab are heavily involved in both computational and experimental work related to compressible flow, although in the realm of combustion dynamics. There are a few projects I am aware of that work with computational compressible flow on the aerodynamics side inside the combustion lab, but it depends on the project.\n\nOf course, this is coming from someone who isn't involved on the aerodynamics side so take it with a grain of salt, but I hope this helps!",

It starts and drives (sans boot). It\u2019s got a fresh oil change.

The research option states that\u2019s you have to have 5 out of 9 research for credit (the other four can be audited), which means 5cr CS 4699 and 4hrs CS 4698. The exact statement was also apparent in the CS junior design completion guidelines, but underneath it there was a requirements section which showed 3 credits as options between CS 4699/CS 4980 and the other 6 as strictly CS 4980. I don\u2019t know the difference between these two, and I really want to audit some hours in the summer to avoid paying expensive tuition. Is it possible to audit 5 hrs for RO in CS junior design? How many hours of 4980 do you have to have?\n\nThank you in advance for those answering my question.",

I don't recommend doing them during the summer or at another school.\n\nIf anything, I'd take the hard core classes like Math and Science/Lab electives at a Georgia Perimeter college or GSU during the Summer instead since they'll be easier than doing them at Tech. And you'll get them out of your way. You'll want your hard classes during the main semesters to be only your major courses, adding hard sciences/math on top of that makes your life much harder than just having an easy humanity taking up space instead.",

So it is possible, but you'll have to come in with quite a few credit hours and take a higher than normal course load to do it (including some summer semesters). \n\nHopefully this advice isn't outdated. Also, other people might have different opinions, and YMMV.\n\nYou should make sure you genuinely enjoy both majors. I think the general consensus is that having a second undergrad degree doesn't make you more employable than having one undergrad degree + internship/co-op experience. So you probably shouldn't do this if your motivation is just to get a job (although maybe there are some niche jobs that need both EE and Math knowledge, idk for sure.)\n\nIf you can afford it, taking 4.5-5 years to double major might not be too bad, especially since you'll have a lower course load each semester. I don't think employers or grad schools will look at that too negatively.\n\nIn EE, you'll probably want to take classes in signal processing, control systems, and/or info theory as those are the more math heavy areas of EE. \n\nFinally, try not to take Real Analysis and Abstract Algebra in the same semester since those will likely have proof intensive homeworks due regularly. You don't want to pull two late/all nighters each week.\n\nThat's all the advice I can think of right now. Good luck!",

But if you're really interested in mathematics, and you're good at building intuition for math by yourself, and it's more recreational/curiosity based for you rather than based on career interests, I would just major in EE and learn the math on your own later on. The reason is that all the rigour and heavy workload in mathematics classes (or any subject for that matter) in my opinion doesn't translate well into *actual understanding* of the topic, just the ability to churn out results, with the drawback of having to do countless of exercises that the professors want you to do, rather than the ones that actually interest *you*. All the while, not giving you additional employability benefits. In fact, just putting down that you're interested in mathematics and read a lot on maths on your resume will already boost your chances of getting an EE job -- no need for that extra degree, unless the job specifically requires it. That will give you more time to learn mathematics in the way that interests *you*, and if you're talented this will actually be more productive and give you more long-term advantage.",

The only remaining reason to give your student buzz funds would be to prevent them from using the money to splurge on something besides food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a roommate who spent his cash on a 3D card for his computer and ended up eating my Tostitos over thanksgiving when the meal halls closed down.

Think wiffle ball on steroids. \n\nHere\u2019s a video of an example game\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8jH2JEL84Fo?si=DZhruFsvbEaZgM4B\n\nOur club rules will be slightly different, and we don\u2019t have massive dedicated mini-stadiums, but you get the idea.\n\nParticipation costs nothing, and we\u2019re looking to grow the sport in the area, so we plan to start slow and build up, so it\u2019s a perfect way to get off campus and meet new people, as well as something fun to do with friends!\n\nHere\u2019s the discord we\u2019re going to use to organize games\n\nhttps://discord.gg/cumjWrHX\n\nReach out if you have any questions; I hope to see you on the field!\n\n",

If the institute/college actually cared about funding these scholarships, I'm sure that allocating just 5k from the 70k overhead for each phd student per year would fund plenty of undergrad and omscs scholarship recipients",

            "selftext": "I just got the email that my grad portrait pics from grad fest were ready. I go to the website and pick a package as I'm checking out and put in the promo code I got after registering for an account. It said invalid promo code, mind you the GradImages people were there giving out flyers that said register your account for a promo code. So I went to Google to look for a number to call and saw the reviews and wowwww, they have a 1.4-star rating with sooo many people complaining about never getting their pics in the mail or getting poor quality pics AND the promo codes not working. Why does GT still use these people?  Anyways, any recs for local studios in Atlanta for grad pics or local photographers because the reviews are off-putting, not gonna pay for that!!!  \n\n\nTLDR: GradImages seems to do bad business, please recommend some photographers and or local studios for grad pics.  \n ",

It\u2019s called \u201csocial dancing\u201d for a reason; there\u2019s no romantic subtext involved.\n\n(2) ORGT \u2014 outdoorsy people are generally quite outgoing. Maybe it\u2019s the sun. Go to some of their meetings, and maybe sign up for a trip or two. It\u2019s incredibly cheap and incredibly fun.\n\n(3) Intramural sports \u2014 there\u2019s random groups of people playing sports at STAMPS all the time. I met my best friends one Wednesday afternoon playing soccer. Just ask, and don\u2019t be afraid if some people say no. They won\u2019t remember you.",

Don't be standoffish, but don't immediately try to spend all your time with anyone either.

Most of the guys there are very friendly and would love to help you out. And then you could just ask if he wants to grab food afterwards or if you could join him for his next lift. \n\nIf it\u2019s not natural then don\u2019t force it, because you will undoubtedly find people who want to be around you and enjoy your company.\n\nHope this helps!",

So much so I took a random statics class before transferring to fill up my semester.  I think the essay could have a good something to do with it too.  I took a lot of time on that thing forging a sense of identity and passion.  Regardless.  No shame being put on the wait-list.

I am a veteran so people say that is a lil bit of a boost during the acceptance process, but it\u2019s not a proven thing. I failed 3 courses at before transferring and the grades replaced by taking those courses again. I had a 3.84 GPA, no research or extracurricular activities linked to the school. I was able to technically apply using the REPP pathway and the veterans pathway but they accepted me under the REPP. I explained all of my circumstances about failing classes and I did do volunteer work as well as tutoring at the library for free since I was often there to study and my ex girlfriend was a tutor that would get swamped with students and needed extra help so all the students got tutored. They offered me a student tutoring position while I was there but I turned it down because I did to help not for money and if it became a job I wouldn\u2019t like doing it as much. I mentioned all this on my application as well as making several drafts for the application essays and having several people look through them to make sure they were top notch. I don\u2019t think my application was anything special, but I think your essays do matter a good bit because it\u2019s not just academic standing they are looking for. They want to make sure you are a good fit for GA Tech morally and ethically. As well as having drive and aspirations. You may have been waitlisted but don\u2019t give up!",

There tends to be a lot of internal mobility though beween sections of large courses (e.g. if im signed up for prof A in section A and I just decide to go to prof B's lectures cause i understand them better). It really depends a lot on your ability to force yourself to focus and work on your own, and the support network you build with friends and peers in the same classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImportant to note as well: a lot of core classes require attendance or something along those lines. E.g. from my experience:\n\n\\- Combinatorics\n\n\\- Psych\n\n\\- Probability and statistics\n\n\\- 2110 and 2200 (though tbf these can be done via reading the slides afterwards for lectures -- labs require physical tap in id card attendance sometimes)\n\n\\- etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of classes have recordings but an equal amount if not more don't. Also, if you don't go in person, you pbly won't watch the lecture if you're being honest.",

Specifically things like electricity, water, and gas usage. I know these depend on how much you actually use, but I am just trying to get a rough idea. Currently I have budgeted about $150/month for these costs. Is this reasonable ?\n\nAs a reference, In my current apartment I use about \\~200 kWh per month (for electricity). \n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqsdb186zylc1.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2414588893825434d05e599e7a7f80ac3f869b3",

In contrast I know people who are from different counties who got their results in like 2-3 business days. \n\nIs this just me or does anyone else have the same problem?",

I originally submitted it on February 18th. Since then, I have called HireRight multiple times and was even able to reach their escalation team.\n\nAccording to the representatives I spoke to from HireRight, the consensus is that the criminal and court check for Fulton County is the cause of all the delays. Even though on March 15th, Fulton provided a new way for third party companies to complete their background check on ResearchGA. However, the HireRight representative noted that they could not use ResearchGA because it does not include all the information, or the information is not up to date. They also claimed that their professionals were working on it. Some in this post have suggested that re-submitting a background check would make it go faster, but the HireRight representatives were not sure if this was a good idea.\n\nMoreover, any deadlines or dates that they have are completely arbitrary and not able to be trusted. We also called Fulton County, and they say that they never provide deadlines or ETAs. As a result, please take whatever dates HireRight gives you with a massive grain of salt.\n\nAs for the actual solution to this problem, I reached out to my company's team responsible for background checks, and they provided me with an attestation. An attestation just says that you do not have any criminal actions on your record. After filling this out, my company would allow me to continue the onboarding process.\n\nI would highly encourage everyone to reach out to their recruiters and hiring managers immediately, explaining the situation. Most HR departments should already be aware of the situation with Fulton County and will be ready to help you. Continuing communication with your hiring company is key in this situation.",

Here\u2019s my full timeline below:\n\nMar 27 - I sent the email to company &amp; HireRight and called HireRight\n\nMar 28 - I received the additional form &amp; submitted\n\nMar 31 - Portal updated with a comment from HireRight team that listed form as \u201cforwarded to State Police\u201d\n\nApril 2 - Background check completed by State of GA police\n\n-~-~-~-~-~-~-\n\nHi all - hopefully this is helpful for some. My process is not closed yet - and if it continues to delay, I will ask my HR rep about an Attestation form like @economy-leading5544 suggested. Or - if it wraps up and completes, I\u2019ll provide an update here. \n\nHere is the email I sent to my company\u2019s HR rep WITH the hire right service email on CC. Immediately after sending, I called the hire right help number (waited on hold for forever) and walked them (verbatim) through the email to force action. The HireRight rep didn\u2019t know what I was talking about (even though shouldn\u2019t they be the ones notifying me of this??) - so I had them click the article, asked them if they read it in totality, etc. \n\nThere\u2019s now a note on my check in hireright that says my request was \u201cescalated.\u201d Shortly after I received the form others have mentioned about signing off for a state-level background check. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nHere\u2019s my email:\n\nSubject: Fulton County Issue &amp; Remediation - Re: Congratulations on your offer! \n\nHi [HR REP NAME], \n\n01. BACKGROUND\n\nHope you are doing well! As I'm incredibly excited to get started - I've been monitoring the progress of my background check. \n\nAccording to the HireRight portal, it looks like it is ##% complete - with the main variable not yet complete being my Atlanta (Fulton County) criminal &amp; offense record. While all other cities seemed to clear within a day or two of the request, this one is still pending so I decided to look into it a bit. \n\n\n02. Issue - TLDR\n\nIt appears that &lt;[Fulton County experienced a cybersecurity incident early this year](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/news/2024/03/15/fulton-county-incident-response-update-for-march-15-2024)&gt; that has affected their ability to provide this information through county requests. (Source: fultoncountga.gov).\n\nNaturally, as one does, I ended up on a &lt;[Reddit forum about this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1b4twfr/anyone_else_waiting_for_hireright_background_check/)&gt; where many others were experiencing (and are still experiencing) the same issue. (Source: reddit r/gatech).\n\n\n03. Solution - TLDR\n\nHowever, both the forum and the official state communication have provided a solution saying that:\n\"Third-Party Background Checks\nThird-party background checks completed by accessing court records were affected by the outage. Those checks can now be completed following the transition to a new record search site. Companies conducting third party searches should now access records through re:SearchGA at https://researchga.tylerhost.net/\"\n\n\n04. My Quick Ask\n\nWould you be able to look into this for me and confer with the HireRight team that they use the state-recommended site to access records in order to expedite the process of my background check? \n\nThanks in advance for any help you may be able to provide!",

If any of you saw a post I made earlier this week about a housing dilemma I had (ended up deleting it because I thought it was too niche of an issue), I got it resolved!\n\nAnyway, my actual post is about y'alls experience living in some of the on-campus apartments. My friends and I are rising 2nd years and are hoping to get into Crecine, but we wanted to have some backup options in case that doesn't happen. I currently live in NAV North (accoms), which has definitely been something (if you live here you already know LOL). Despite that, I do like the convenience of the dining hall being right there, and also having laundry.\n\nIf any of y'all have lived in the following apartments, please feel free to share what your experience was like! Just want ideas on which buildings to prioritize for backups.\n\n* NAV South, East\n* Crecine (#1 choice)\n* Zbar\n* GLC (since it's apparently for undergrads now?)\n* 8th Street\n* Center Street\n* Nelson-Shell\n* Maulding",

It makes it a pain in the ass if two people are cooking bc you have to do the weird squeeze behind thing, but in terms of everything else it's a solid building. I've heard decent things about Eighth and Z-Bar. Apparently Nelson Shell had roaches at one point? Could be hearsay.",

We know it's stateside, now we just need to hope that shipping and installation happen promptly. We know it's been FAR too long. There were several supply chain issues that slowed this down.\n\n* We are also expecting 4 more treadmills to arrive any day now to help alleviate some of the broken ones.\n\n* Peter's parking deck is open. We are still process-improving on how things work out there. We've gotten great feedback thus far.\n\n* Ken Byers will have inconsistent hours now that NCAA tennis is in season. It is important to check the GTAA schedule before showing up for open play. \n\nAs always you can message me or reply to this thread - I do my best to reply here.\n\nIf you have any questions about our operations or other general CRC questions, please email us or visit our [website](https://www.crc.gatech.edu/).

So, for example, if you chose the Intelligence (AI) thread, you\u2019ll have to take your generic CS prerequisites and various general Ed. classes but then you get to take a handful of classes specific to AI like Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, etc. they give you like 9 options and usually you\u2019re required to take like 3 of them. And you get to choose two of these threads. I believe Computer Engineering does this too. But yeah, so they\u2019re releasing (dropping) a new Cybersecurity thread, that\u2019ll basically allow you to take 3 of these classes pertaining to Cybersecurity. I\u2019m not sure if these classes are new, but yeah, that\u2019s basically what I mean. A few of these classes are like, \u201cMalware Reverse Engineering,\u201d and, \u201cCyberwarfare,\u201d which sound insanely interesting. I hope explanation makes sense.",

It\u2019s not that Georgia Tech CoC doesn\u2019t have the money, it\u2019s that they just don\u2019t want to pay their employees a fair wage if they don\u2019t have to.\n\nedit: sorry on mobile i can\u2019t read lol",

They know the labor pool is desperate for work and experience and their is a countless supply of students to exploit. Its not so much supply and demand when the supply is inherently unlimited in comparison to the positions needed.\n\nThe only way to overcome these types of control in labor markets is through collective actions like strikes, unions, or legislation. But these types of jobs don't lend themselves well to those types of things.\n\nPublic schools shouldn't be treating their students like a job market to exploit for cheap labor. There should be mandated minimums tied to cost of living. You can't have a labor market system when all the TA jobs are controlled by one owner. It's not like they can go work at another school they don't attend for a better wage.\n\nIt's a monopoly on \"work experience\" and recommendation letters that they are using to pay people a garbage wage.",

When do recruitment start, where should we register, what is the process (how long and any details I need to know), and are there any fees? How competitive is the process? How much are the dues (and additional ones) for each sorority, and do they work on per-semester basis? Once accepted, do we need to reregister for the next semester? Is it mandatory to attend every events and parties, and what are the requirements to maintain your membership? What are advantages and disadvantages of joining? How are the houses, as in the building and facilities? Does each member get their own bedroom and a shared bathroom? Also, any thoughts on joining a sorority as an introvert?",

[https://www.gatechcpc.com/welcome](https://www.gatechcpc.com/welcome)\n\nSorority membership is not a social club that you register for a semester at a time. Once initiated you are expected to be a member for all your undergrad years. Greek organizations are regarded as membership for life; when you graduate you become an alum member.\n\nA sorority, or fraternity, is only as good as everyone participating and contributing. \n\nTo maintain your membership you need to stay current on your dues, participate in all required activities, and keep your grades up. Dues are billed each semester and you really can't opt out for a semester unless you aren't in school. Plus there is a meal plan and everyone takes their meals at the house and the meal plans are pretty good plus it's a great way to meet others and get comfortable as a new member. Participation is required for weekly meetings, philanthropic events, and most sisterhood events and socials unless you have a valid excuse.  Sorority membership is not really a drop in kind of thing, you need to be committed, but you will get far more out of it if you throw yourself into the opportunities.\n\nEach member does not live in the house, only about 1/3 - 1/2 the membership lives in plus exec officers are required. First years never live in the house. The rooms are a roommate situation, not singles, and there are common bathrooms for everyone on a floor.\n\nThe big advantage is friendship. You will not like everyone but most members find their group of close friends. That's what it's all about. Relationships in a Greek organization are really like a bell curve: you will love and be close with a small group, you will like and respect most of the other members to a certain degree, and there will be some that you really don't care for at all if not can't stand. But that's life. There will be members in your major and in your classes that you can study with, there will be members involved in clubs and orgs all over campus and can help you get involved too if you want. If you want leadership experience there are many offices you can run for, you will learn how to run a formal meeting efficiently (a great skill) and you will hopefully develop skills to get along with all kinds of personalities. You will also meet and make friends in other sororities and fraternities, as well as their friends who aren't in Greek life.\n\nIf you are an introvert you may find recruitment difficult. You need to hold up your end of a social conversation and show your best personality and appearance, and not just answer questions with short answers. Too many PNM's equate recruitment as an interview process but it's not at all, it's a process to find best fit. Each house has a slightly different vibe and a culture. Sororities are social organizations and social skills are important. After recruitment it is important to try to make friends in your new member class. Meetings and meals help with this, plus you can hang out at the house when you aren't in class. You don't have to be a gregarious person necessarily, but you might need to get out of your comfort zone at first and then it gets easier.",

The 8 NPC sororities actually really are far more alike than different, with around 175-200 members in each one. \n\nWhat anyone thinks of each group's vibe or culture or characteristics is completely dependent on their own personal lens, the individuals they happen to interact with, and the influence from other's personal opinions.  \n\nRecruitment is in person for a reason. The only way to get a feel for the different sororities is through meeting and talking to members.  This is why fall formal recruitment is the best time to consider joining because you get to meet some members in all houses at least once.\n\nYou also need to keep in mind that recruitment is a two-way process; the sororities will be making their own determination about the PMN's 'vibes' as well, and while you may decide you think you like the vibe of certain sororities best, those chapters may think that other PNM's are a better fit for them. In that case they would release you and you would need to focus on your other options. \n\nTLDR; you can't go through recruitment before you go through recruitment. Keep an open mind and don't think you can predetermine a certain house for yourself.",

Yes there are required things you go to each semester, but if you have serious conflicts (classes, jobs, etc.) most will try to work with you. Like you would expect anywhere, you'll be really close to a subset and maybe not know others as well. But the support I have felt from those I didn't realize knew my name has been incredible. From day 1 I had people offering to help me study, plan schedules for classes, and a group who would consistently bring me dinner across campus when I had evening classes just to make sure I would eat something. Greek life may not be a great fit for everyone, but if you're curious, take a look at the CPC guide, watch some of the GT sorority sisterhood videos on youtube, and rush. You can always back out of rush, COB at a later date, or join a chapter and then drop before initiation if it's not a right fit for you.",

            "selftext": "Hey guys! Coming on here for some advice and insights into off campus housing.\n\nI\u2019m a rising senior, and like hundreds of other students, I have been pushed off campus for the 24-25 school year. This leaves me exploring my off campus options. I\u2019m looking at apartments preferably near east side of campus, and something fairly affordable as well. I am a first generation student, and navigating this situation on my own has been kinda difficult\ud83d\ude05\n\nMy current options are Uhouse, 100 midtown, standard, and the here. I also would need a parking spot, so that must be taken into account. Based on my research, Uhouse is the most affordable option, but it apparently has majorly gone downhill in the past year or so based on other Reddit posts and google reviews. Is it really as bad as everyone says it is? Are my other options fairly decent? Just looking for insights from current or previous residents. Which option is the best for me? Also, are there any other options that I\u2019m not considering?\n\nThanks guys ",

Their office was so annoying and its practically impossible to contact someone when you need to, also their utilities are also so expensive. I remember paying like $80 one month when at uhouse the max i've paid is $11\n\nOut of all your options, here is probably the best if money is not a huge concern but if it is then uhouse isnt as bad as everyone makes it out to be (its just not as nice as the other apts)",

Some of the other buildings like D and E only have stairs and I think 4 floors total, with entrances on both 1st and 2nd floors.\n\nI think all the buildings are pretty decent, I was in E and my friend in B. The top floor of B has bigger windows and a higher ceiling so it feels extra nice lol",

It still baffles me that people think that having one plant based protein option for double the price of meat is considered an adequate option for vegans/vegetarians. Like seriously, you can't tell me tofu costs more than beef, I know how much they cost. Maybe these fake meat options should be replaced with protein like tofu or beans that aren't as expensive or something? Because just having vegetables as the only affordable option is ridiculous. I know this is a bigger issue than just at GT because of demand, but I just needed to rant somewhere because it's actually getting super frustrating. Also curious to hear other vegetarian/vegan's experiences here.",

One word of advice, cooking yourself saves a lot of money, is much healthier and can be more rewarding. Yes, there is a bit of a learning curve and time commitment but after the first month its a lot better. As far as on campus options go, twisted does a fairly good job so maybe check them out.",

In terms of my experiences,\n\n1. Cooking so so valuable. You save money and you can start simple. If you have a pan, you can always make a run to Publix to get a lotta veggies (different colors), pasta, sauce and whip up your \"mostly homemade pasta\"\n\n2. In terms of protein, tofu has been a valuable asset. I personally am into making curries. An easy way could be to get some veggies, tofu, and thai curry paste (yellow, red, etc) and whip up a beautiful thai curry in minutes. You can enjoy with rice! Also, my roommate and I also like to make quesadillas with refried black beans, veggies, taco seasoning, taco sauce, some chilli powders, cheese and its also not as difficult if you put your mind to it\n\nThe point is that sometimes we gotta get a bit creative and realize that there are options if you actively try them out!\n\n3. In terms of food options if you dont have time to cook or unable to, below are a list of places that could work (according to my experience + vegetarian friends' experiences). Not exahustive by any means:\n\n* Chipotle\n* Rreal tacos\n* Lucky Buddha\n* Govindas Cafe (they deliver to campus if you join their whatsapp group. very affordable)\n* Food terminal\n* Mamouns Falafel\n* Gyro Bros\n* Sometimes there's this place called Marrakech Express that comes to campus to serve lunch. Price point and food really good\n*",

And it's definitely that way in other countries, even in France when I visited! I think it's because there they don't use things like impossible or beyond, but they use more common items like soy, beans, eggs, etc., making the options cheaper. I wish they'd use those here rather than these more expensive alternatives. Because at the end of the day, it's not exactly a \"good option\" if nobody can reasonably afford it, especially on a college campus. I'm just venting my frustrations but yeah, it's the south, probably isn't going to change :(",

I do appreciate the school trying to improve our options but please \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f keep our wallets in mind (also Slutty Vegan as a company just sucks, discussion for another day). I know it's hard for the school to bring back chains like subway, Panera, taco bell, etc., but I think campus food would be a lot better if they provided vegetarian options like those rather than expensive alternatives.",

Tech Square, food trucks, and community market stuff) at a given time, but **everybody ignores everything** not named Panda, CFA, or Twisted Taco. \n\nIf you want Subway, did you *at least* try 5th Street Deli or Whistle Bistro? Both had a format similar to Subway but they were changed last year because nobody ate there. Even now, they have Jimmy Johns. Does JJ not have vegan options? \n\nIn Oct 2022, Test Kitchen had a [plant based menu](https://imgur.com/a/5ySHBoy). They even went out of their way to feature people from Veggie Jackets on their IG to talk about it and those highlights are still visible. Nobody ate there and they never brought the special menu back. \n\nThey've had at least 4 vegan food trucks on campus at one point or another, but nobody ate at those except Slutty Vegan so the others stopped coming. It's disheartening for food truck owners to see the never ending line for Slutty Vegan while it takes an act of congress for students to look in your direction. \n\nSee the running theme? Actions speak louder than words and when people don't patronize XYZ, they're going to change the format to whatever people will patronize. \n\nThe Slutty Vegan situation is complicated so I'll leave it at this: their food truck was the MOST successful food truck to set foot on campus. Now that they're here permanently, everybody hates them. I don't get it.",

JJ is similar to others as they have no protein, it's still just vegetables. I like Subway because they have those patties and places like Panera have eggs, taco bell has beans, etc (for an affordable price too).\n\nAnd I totally get your point with Slutty Vegan. Maybe it's their good marketing (like wow there's a burger named sloppy toppy? That's crazy, I gotta check that out!) But now since we have it here permanently, I think it's easier to see that each burger is 20 dollars which trumps their brand. Honestly, I'm not sure how well Slutty Vegan is doing, I'm assuming not well because it burns through everyone's wallets, but I could be wrong. I'd be curious to know though.",

Come up with a data structure and practice adding an element to it, removing an element, etc. Then check your work with CS Vistool. \n\nThe Big O questions were the hardest in my opinion, since they were the trickiest. Here the main tip I have is to write out the worst case time complexities for all operations of all data structures (e.g. adding to external chaining hashmap) and study that.",

However, getting only negative feedback with zero positive reinforcement isn\u2019t exactly balanced constructive criticism, and I\u2019d hope it\u2019s not the norm in the real world.\n\nFor example, we were meeting with a faculty member seeking advice on the valuation section of our report asking whether we should explain a high-level framework or be more granular and try to execute the valuation and produce numbers. She said that without fail, the examiners will be disappointed either way. You\u2019re damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be a baby, but I hope it\u2019s understandable that it\u2019s not super validating to do a project given unclear expectations and being told that no matter how hard you\u2019ll try, you\u2019ll always be a disappointment. It honestly makes me want to put in less effort since we\u2019ll be a disappointment either way. \n\nI\u2019d love to hear if alumni look back on Senior Design thinking it\u2019s more or less intense than the real world and if they felt they\u2019d actually learned applicable skills in this class ",

They want to be as harsh, but they're not as connected with the project and they don't have the time to add nuance and positive feedback. I was lucky because my team's advisor did a good job of meeting with us after the interim and translating the pure criticism into something constructive (if still harsh, we were objectively behind at that point).\n\nBecause of that, I personally had a great experience, but if you don't have a faculty member on your side like that, I'd say just keep you head down, take your passing grade, and get out.\n\ntldr:\n\nGood advisor: ignore the haters and have fun doing a cool project\n\nBad advisor: just get out",

Teams feel like the feedback is \"rating their performance\" while the faculty are just trying to give clear, candid feedback based on their experience in industry.\n\nIt can feel harsh, even brutal, but we would be doing a disservice to any students by not giving them clear feedback.\n\nGetting feedback that hurts to hear doesn't mean you aren't doing a great job!

If you get little to no feedback, that's when you should really be worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you think you're going to get kinder feedback given in a way that's easier to hear in industry.. you won't.",

He didn't tell us how it was wrong or what could be fixed. We confirmed with our Accounting notes and the CFO of the client's company, and the formula was correct. I've also heard stories of ISYE faculty getting so angry that they storm out of the room during a presentation. I'm beyond open to constructive or even majority negative feedback, but the excessive dramatics and the fact that they seem allergic to giving a compliment every blue moon is very exhausting",

I also make a list of my most commonly made mistakes and thinking patterns.

Your question is a little different, but I think nevertheless talking with your professor about what you're doing, what works and what doesn't, will be the most productive route. I find that a 15 or 20 minute chat during office hours can go a long way to sharpen understanding in a way that would be super difficult to do on one's own. Good luck!",

Self-care in general is a really good idea before any high-stakes/high-pressure situation, and tests are no different.\n\nDuring the exam, force yourself to slow. down. Make a pact with yourself to read every question twice. For problem set type tests, commit to checking your answers once you get them. It's often possible to verify that the answer you got is reasonable; this will let you catch misinterpreting the question. Practice these behaviors with the practice exams.\n\nWhen you take the practice exams, do you do a mock test? Give yourself a time limit, and the same resources available for the real exam? It is very easy to think \"oh, I've got this\" after flipping through a practice exam with the answers written out. But it sounds like your issues are more with \"how to test\" than with the core material; reading the answer key isn't helpful for those problems but practicing taking the test is!",

There is not such a thing as \"just\" an EE or BME; you specialize in sub-disciplines while working. Good on you for figuring this out now.\n\nEdit: I strongly recommend joining professional societies and going to company events if you want more exposure to engineering job options.

When I was learning data science, I did attend an online presentation and they went over the job titles for different roles (analyst, data scientist, data engineer, ML researcher, etc.) but it was still hard to understand the distinctions until I read lots of job postings, and I sent out multiple resumes for jobs with different titles that were not really matches (HR could probably tell right away). It takes time, and with the internet you can find lots of job postings and look at a few a day to get a better grasp on what responsibilities different positions entail - I highly recommend it, especially for current students!",

Great talent will only want to come to GT if they have a competitive program and a pro-style offense (with rare exceptions, GT has a tough time getting offensive skill positions into the league and it's usually just trenches guys).\n\nPaul Johnson did the best with what he had but we will continue to struggle as long as our Athletics department refuses to gets real and smart about their strategy to challenge UGA meaningfully.\n\nWe are a harder school than UGA - that is both a positive and negative. You can go farther in life with a degree from GT (on average) than a degree from UGA. So that should be an advantage when recruiting talent. BUT GT is hard and if a top talent is focused on playing college football and then going pro, then they don't (and probably shouldn't) focus on too much else other than football. Why would they put themselves through the stress of weed-out engineering classes when they could be racing cars after strip club visits in Athens?\n\nIdeally we would want to recruit athletes that are up for the challenge academically but also talented on the field. That unique subgroup of athletes typically make the best pro players anyway (professionalism, game IQ etc.). Stanford and Michigan are both academically challenging schools but are able to recruit well because they have a firm strategy on *who* to recruit.\n\nGT sells itself in terms of the quality of the degree, location, program history etc. It's in a big conference as well. The problem is our team doesn't have the vision or the belief that it can create a culture of high performing athletes that won't just get destroyed by UGA. It would take a big personality that comes from a culture of winning and understands the nuance and history of GT Football, that could create pull and get us up to the floor of talent necessary to challenge for a ranked spot consistently. One good hire can be the difference maker. I doubt we will see that though. The athletics department is too narrow-minded/focused on short term appointments, when, in reality, no one ever truly believes that we will win a CFB championship from year to year when in reality it should be totally possible.",

I am prospective international student (from india) seeking for clarity from current internationals studentI would be very much thankful to you all for answering my question and clearing my doubt.  \n**question and doubt:**  \n**1).** I know that it takes 30 credit to achieve the degree, They have also mention this \"Courses are offered all three terms; however, full-time students planning to complete the MS degree in 12 months should start their programs in the fall semester.\" But actually I am planing for the spring semester intake , So Is it possible for complete it in 12month/3 terms (3 semester).  \nThis is important doubt to clear, because I am trying to estimate the total tuition fees from it",

It'll help you plan your coursework.\n\nI think it's 90% accurate - If your TIA/TIG is telecom/css/dsp I can let you know how much you can rely on it. \n\nUnrelated note - finishing your MS in 1 year is not worth it unless you don't care about actual research and you are only doing it for the \"flashy degree\". It's your call. Anyway the usual schedule is 1.5 years unless you spend around $20k extra for extending it up to 2 years. 12 credits minimum does REALLY suck.",

            "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI recently received an offer for a co-op position at GTRI in the field of cybersecurity. However, I'm uncertain if this is something I want to commit to 100%, considering I might want to change professions in the future or focus on a different area.\n\nIf I decide that I no longer want to pursue this field, would it be acceptable or professionally ethical to resign or not return after a semester? The employment is not binding. I'm genuinely excited about this career opportunity, and it seems interesting, but I'm very unsure whether I will enjoy it or want to shift my focus.\n\nAdditionally, it's at GTRI, so would leaving have any effect on my opportunities at GT? Thanks so much!",

If you do one semester and decide you like cybersecurity, then no problem, you returned to the same position later. If you decide you don\u2019t want to return to the same position, just tell them you very much like GTRI but are interested in [insert discipline] and interested in other opportunities within GTRI to pursue that. If you demonstrate that you\u2019re smart and motivated, your manager could be a reference to another position within GTRI. \n\nTechnology careers are more fluid than you may think in terms of disciplines. I started as a software engineer but have also run lead the cybersecurity programs for a start up, managed IT/help desk, been a business analyst, project manager, lead infrastructure and devops teams, and more. Knowing how all the different disciplines work together can help you architect better solutions and better build and organize teams.",

My post got a looooot of attention like it became one of the most popular posts on there \ud83e\udee8 so my now boyfriend didn\u2019t bother approaching me\n\nBut it also hit him at 2 am when I got an Instagram DM from him randomly\n\nHis line was \u201cI heard you like anime, wanna be friends? \ud83d\ude05\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 we laugh at it together now\n\nI had a boyfriend at that time and of course, we didn\u2019t know each other irl so all that came out of it was him sending me random reels that were not my humor or interest \ud83e\udd2a\n\nWe were totally online our first year. When we finally got to campus sophomore year, we met up the second day of moving in (still before classes) and he introduced me to a group of people he knew that is now our friend group that has amassed about 30 people from GT :D and we\u2019re all close\n\nHe found out that I was single and then he started to get flirtier (? LOL idk what was happening it was a blur) for two weeks\n\nAnd then he confessed to me at the CRC (which was set up by our friends) he started the conversation off by asking me relationship questions \ud83e\udee3 and then asked if I know who he liked\n\nAnd then he pulled out his phone and it was our DM\u2019s HAHA so cute \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\n\nand we are still together now and he sends me cute reels of animals and calls me a rat\n\nTL;DR: shoot your shot :)",

We met through Pride Alliance plus a hazmat emergency.\n\nThis was back in 2010, so I don't know if they still do this, but at the time Pride Alliance did a group lunch every Tuesday. We'd both attended that irregularly, but hadn't interacted.\n\nOne day, I was between classes and walking through campus when I saw a massive collection of emergency vehicles. I found out later there'd been a silane gas leak in one of the labs. Anyway, I had time to kill, so I was just standing there watching the spectacle. This guy walked by on the sidewalk, and we realized we recognized each other from Pride lunches, so we said hi and started chatting. He was a transfer student and was feeling gloomy about doing badly in classes and possibly needing to drop one. I reassured him this was normal at Tech and dropping a class doesn't mean you're a failure. We had a nice chat for 15 minutes or so and then parted ways.\n\nSoon after, he realized we might never meet again, so he tracked me down through mutual friends in Pride Alliance, we exchanged messages, and arranged a date. The story goes on, but TLDR we've been together 14 years and finally tied the knot a few years ago.",

Sometime during our freshman year there was this girl that I kept noticing in Brittain. Instantly attracted. Didn't do anything, though, and moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to end of fall semester 2005, and instead of studying I decide to trawl Facebook (still TheFacebook at the time). Found out that this girl also happened to know another friend of mine from classes freshman year. I asked said friend to introduce us. She agreed and held a party right after finals at her apartment in 6th Street. F and I met, found out we lived in Woodruff North together. We chatted every now and again, and in May 2006 after finals F's roommate asked F for some alone time with her then-boyfriend (a uga grad, ugh). So F and I got to hang out for a bit.\n\nWe went on our first date the summer of 2006. It went well, we did an impromptu extension, ended up having some chemistry. Went on a second date and met her younger sister and her now-husband (that was quick). I thought things were getting serious. So I tried to determine the relationship (does that term still exist?). F said she doesn't want to be in a serious relationship because she just got out of a long one with a not-so-great guy. Well shit.\n\nBut I wouldn't take no for an answer! Fall 2006 started, and we continue casual dating. It slowly gets more and more serious, and in fall 2007 I lavaliere her. We graduate December 2008, and for Christmas we get engaged. Finally got married in 2012, and now we're working on raising the next generation of Tech grads.\n\nEven if it's a remote opportunity, pursue those opportunities!",

Here\u2019s some of the pros and cons I can think of off the top of my head\n\nPros:\n- In state tuition (if you\u2019re out of state) (no additional out of state fees like you would see if you do undergrad)\n- cost of living (rent particularly) is cheaper\n- smaller classes so you get to know your professors well\n- you get to go abroad (they only do classes M-R so you can take long weekends to travel)\n- registration (particularly first semester) is WORLDS less stressful than your first semester as a MS student on Atlanta campus. Classes rarely fill up at GT-E compared to the madhouse that is ATL Phase-2 registration\n- Applying to BS/MS on GTE campus gets you a much faster acceptance than the ATL campus (~2-4 weeks vs ~2-4 months depending on when you apply) and is pretty much a guaranteed acceptance as long as you meet GPA requirements- I\u2019ve heard rumblings that this is no longer the case for ATL campus applications but haven\u2019t confirmed\u2026\n\nCons:\n- Course selection can be a bit slim but they have it posted on their website ahead of time so you can see if they offer stuff you\u2019re interested\n- (pro tip on the class registration: if you see an online class taught in the online campus/shenzen campus you can probably convince them to give you a waiver to take that class)\n- long time away from home\n- language barrier can be a bit rough when dealing with administrative stuff (getting housing, a visa, etc) but once you\u2019re in the city people are very nice and accommodating if you make an attempt to speak French. \n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s more I am missing, so ask me any questions- I can see what advice I can give. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s a great experience I would say. Though it is dependent on how social you are willing to be. I went with friends from undergrad, so that helped me a lot. If you do the BSMS program, you only have to stay there for one semester (obvs you could do it your whole time there too if you like). If you do it through just a plain MS you would have to spend 2 semesters there. Great opportunity to travel and see loads of Europe. Would recommend if studying abroad has been something of interest.",

Equipment is expensive, editing takes time, and you're valuable :)!\n\nEdit: as this event is tmmrw, you won't be able to rent a library camera in time... But def would recommend for future events.",

Unfortunately I don\u2019t have much academic advice since I\u2019m struggling too and pretty much checked out of the class, but maybe your husband can find comfort knowing others are in his same position\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I've got the gist of what the program is understood, but I just wanted to ask here on this subreddit on what other people's experiences were? Is there some catch to the program, or something I should look out for? I just wanted to know what exactly i'm getting myself into before I start to pick courses that would transfer to gatech at my other school. \n\nFor some background, I'm OOS, and am planning to major in Aerospace Engineering, which gatech is world renowned for. During application season, gatech was my dream school, and some place that I really wanted to go to, but knew it would be hard for me because of me being OOS. I'm sort of adamant on attending gatech now that I have a garunteed chance (as long as I dont slack off my first year), so I really wanted to know about some personal experiences on the program. \n\ntldr: is transferring in through the talent initiative transfer pathway program worth it?

            "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a former employee at GATech, who filed an HR report on the EthicsPoint system in accordance to the university policy about unethical advisor behavior. In the very beginning of the process after I filed, they told me that, even before any investigative action is taken, and even if I choose to withdraw now:\n\nA) My confidential report will be made into public record, as per the Georgia Open Records act.  \nB) The person I am alleging advisor abuse against, will be notified of the information.\n\nI was told that this would happen independent of any choice I make now including to withdraw the complaint, even though the case has not yet begun beyond them contacting me and having a short Microsoft Teams meeting with me / receiving my complaint.  The EthicsPoint site I submitted the report to said that the information would be \"confidential\" (source: Ethicspoint Navex terms and conditions). This seems to be directly violated by A, B given that I cannot withdraw according to the HR employee I spoke to, and no where in their terms and conditions or their website was this clearly indicated.\n\nA and B combined means that sensitive personal details of my complaint will be unmasked to the person I am complaining against, which includes information about people who can corroborate my story, who I would prefer not be known to the complainee due to retaliation potential.  There is also personal information that I would prefer not be made public (although if it is, the world doesn't end for me).\n\nI have already considered seeking legal advice, and may pursue it if there are no further options at the university. I aware of the 50-18-72 carveout of the Georgia Open Records act.  I do not believe i was informed about the Open Records Act prior to filing a report that was called \"confidential\", nor was I informed that I would have no way to stop the process and no way to prevent the complainee to be informed even if I wanted to back out of the process.\n\nI was wondering if there was any advice besides for seeking legal representation, to prevent the publication of highly sensitive personal information about witnesses and more.   I am looking into legal representation, and look forward to a chance to exercise my rights.\n\nPS: I am happy speaking to anyone of the details of the case, including my name and information about the case (and the complainee), in private message.",

Plus they tack on some nebulous 65/mo \"amenity fee\" which I have no idea what it covers and they force you to pay like 40/mo for \"valet trash\" that's picked up once a week. Your base rent might be cheap but even before adding power and water that's already like 100/mo in just bullshit fees.\n\nI'm beginning to think shitty leasing offices are sort of normal in this area though unfortunately, can't find any apartments that don't have people who will say the same about theirs.",

It reads exactly like faculty training materials on disgruntled male students prone to disrespect/violence.

Smart individuals step in when they see lazy work leading to negative impacts, and for someone to be an instructor and not have the ability or thoughtfulness to step in to a situation where negative work is being directly addressed by a student ( or at least squelch their worries about it affecting their grade ) that is a huge issue.\n\nWhen you experience that level of apathy, you might hold onto it as well.\n\nEdited the post to leave out her name since it's so concerning to you.",

Along with the acceptance, I've been offered a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) position with an annual stipend of approximately $35k. \n\nAs this is a significant step in my academic journey, I want to make informed decisions moving forward. I'm reaching out to this community for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. Is a $35k/year stipend in line with what's typically offered for Physics GTA positions at GT (or similar institutions)? I want to ensure this offer is competitive and fair.\n\n2. Does anyone have experience or advice on negotiating GTA stipends? Is it common or even advisable to try to negotiate this aspect of a graduate offer?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

And no, I don't think you can negotiate your stipend, and Ph.D. programs do not work that way (I assume you are not from the US in this case).",

                    "body": "Interesting idea. I'd pose it as a generalized \"playlist\" creator rather than \"content curation platform\" which is a clunky mouthful. You call it \"curate lists\" but who cares about \"curation\" - anyone who likes things should be able to use the tool, regardless of whether they view themselves as a \"curator\" or not. And most people don't.\n\nI guess your idea is to approve curators first, but then you have the issue of trusting your curators as tastemakers. It doesn't make sense. Lists that are \"curated\" by your network aren't a draw to your platform. If I were you, I'd open it up to everyone, but I'd also create lists based off of established, public lists. Barack Obama publishes his list of books every year - use that, and you don't have to get Obama to DM you to have him as a curator. Same goes for many artists who publicly list their influences. Start there, build a userbase, then reach out directly to tastemakers who already have a platform.\n\nThere's a huge friction issue with waitlists. If someone's interested, you're turning a user away, and they probably won't come back. If you're truly in an alpha, let people sign up and figure it out. The more data the better. You're not taking money.\n\nAs for the tech, this is entirely on the frontend and very slow. If you click on \"explore,\" you have a flash of \"no trending list found\" before it finally loads all the data. You're leaking your firebase SDK info. Your lighthouse performance score is abysmal, and I could absolutely feel it on first load of even your homepage. If you want to stick to React, highly recommend Remix or Astro, but even Next.js will give you a huge performance boost at this stage.",

To add to that, the class can put you behind in your course schedule due to pre reqs.\n\nYour probably going to have to take useless classes at some point in GT (humanities, English, social sciences, etc).

Some of those lists have many people on them (undergrad, male) while others have very few (grad, GIH). So, it's possible that someone who filled out the form at 1:30pm might have a relatively low position number, if they are on one of the shorter lists.\n\nHOWEVER, that does not mean they have a better chance at getting off their waitlist. People will be offered a space as it becomes available for their classification and gender. If a space can be used for multiple classifications/genders, the original survey timestamp order will be used to fill the space.",

In general, the number of spaces allocated for the different classifications is pre-determined and primarily driven by demand. So, the longer lists have more people, but they also have more beds allocated to them, and vice versa. Ultimately, it depends on how things like cancellations play out over the next few months, so I cannot predict either way, but the person in your scenario might see a slight improvement or they might see the opposite. It should not be meaningful in either direction though, and we'll be monitoring the velocity of each list closely to make sure that is the case. Therefore, I would recommend that person stays on whichever list would potentially provide them the most comfortable living arrangement if they were to get off the waitlist. (Instead of switching for a perceived advantage or in an attempt to game the system.)",

                    "body": "Last year 1,665 people got off the waitlist for on-campus housing ([source](https://youtu.be/CE9KWP0sm7o?si=RcVmS6T07SC2-Ze4&amp;t=371)), so it's likely that you're going to get off the waitlist it's just about when and if it's worth worrying about it. There's also the Waitlist Priority Consideration [form](https://housing.gatech.edu/applicants/faqs#WhatisWaitlistPriorityConsiderationandhowdoesitwork), which I think opens in March but you won't be given priority until July which makes no sense but it's better than nothing if you need on-campus housing for financial reasons, disability, or other factors.\n\nThe most important thing is making sure that you have a worst-case scenario that you can be okay with. If you are waiting for on-campus housing, you need to have a plan for what you'll do if you don't get it since this will allow you not to worry as much and to make sure you have somewhere to live. These worst-case scenarios can be:\n\n* Commuting if that's an option for you\n* Living in an unfurnished apartment that isn't a \"student apartment\", you can get good rates if living with at least one roommate and you can live there until you graduate and you can sign a lease in July or August if needed\n* Finding somewhere last minute to live with people you might not know which will likely be in Home Park or farther from campus (the [GT Housing Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GeorgiaTechSubleasesRoommates/) is a good place for this)\n* Signing somewhere off-campus and trying to find someone to sublease if you get on-campus housing (finding a sublease isn't guaranteed though)\n* Subleasing from someone only for the Fall and trying to get on-campus housing again in the Spring (it'll open in October) since you basically can't get back on-campus once you live off campus unless you live on-campus again only in the Spring\n\nWhile none of these are ideal, it's likely that you'll get off the waitlist and you have options if you don't, so just make sure that you have a solid backup plan so you that don't have to worry while waiting for the waitlist. Good luck :)",

This is definitely very useful, and I encourage people to take a look at what you posted.\n\nHowever, the group I'm making is not exclusively the discussion aspect. To be clear, I'm not claiming that this is a substitute for therapy, or pretend that I know a lot about psychology. But gathering people with similar experiences can't possibly hurt.\n\nThe main differences are that there will be a social aspect. I was thinking about organizing things like campfires, challenges, trips, mini-debates, and all kinds of social events.\n\nAlso, on the more philosophical side, I feel like anxiety and loneliness are increasingly common, and it's all nice that we have facilities to handle mental health on the campus, but many communities don't. Part of running this experiment is to see how making a local group like this can be helpful, and to create a model that could be replicated in communities all over the place. \n\nSome of the more philosophical aims of this are: A. encourage people who are resistant to go to therapy, as many people have inner stigma and shame for going to therapy, B. provide an alternative for people who don't have resources to go to therapy, C. relieve therapists in an ever-increasing mental health epidemic. The best treatment for anxiety is really exposure to what you're afraid of, and a lot of people simply need encouragement and accountability for going beyond their comfort zone; there is no need for psychological expertise for the exposure aspect alone, and exposure by itself is incredibly powerful.",

I don't see how I'm playing a psychologist, because a lot of exposure therapy is also what parents, family, and friends are for. You don't need therapists just to get a net of people who will encourage you to grow as a person. An example from parenting: a child wants to approach other children and play but is afraid, the parent encourages them to go play; an example from friendships: a guy wants to ask out a girl he likes but is afraid, a good friend has their back and encourages them to do it.\n\nThe purpose of this club is to encourage people to try to expose themselves to the things they *want* to experience but are afraid of, step by step. This cannot possibly hurt because people are specifically pursuing things they want to achieve, but didn't have the necessary encouragement. It's goal driven; it's not meant to be a program to eliminate anxiety altogether because it is not clear to me how to do that. But it is true that exposure makes a person braver, and shows a person that they can do more than the thought they can.\n\nOf course, exposing oneself to their frights too radically can be more regressive than helpful. That's why it's important that it is *voluntary* exposure after all, and done in thoughtful moderation. There is no need to have a masters degree here. Besides, I'm not planning to be some kind of \"psychological leader\" more than just an organizer of events where people can try to figure things out on their own. If it makes you happy, I will make people sign waivers that this is not substitute for professional therapy, and that they should enter this club with no expectations. Cheers.",

Person was encouraged to \"face their fear\" and stand up for themselves. Person did not do any role playing or do anything to build up to the level of anxiety they would feel by facing their bully. Person had a panic attack in the break room and ended up in the ER, was fired shortly after for \"unrelated\" performance issues. Person has not been able to find full-time work since and their anxiety has only worsened despite now being in treatment.\n- Person with fear of heights was encouraged to go to higher and higher locations. Person never tried to tolerate their distress, just go and do it and leave. Person ended up being anxious about leaving the ground floor until they entered treatment.\n- Person had anxiety about throwing things away (not trash/hoarding). Person was encouraged to have someone go through things with them for support. Instead of learning to tolerate the anxiety, person became completely dependent on having others make decisions for them until they entered treatment.\n\nShould I go on?\n\nIf you don't have a clinical understanding of what is going on, you're at a risk of providing the wrong kind of encouragement, taking too big a step, becoming an enabler. You don't know what that person needs, and *they* don't know what they need--because neither of you are clinicians.\n\nYeah, most of the time you'll be alright.

Most people will tell you your threads dont matter but id say they kind of do bc the selection of classes in intel is so useless if u dont fall into those categories. Ur learning introductory topics that are difficult to understand and putting urself through multiple stages of hell (getting the class bc of how little seats there are, shitty profs, bad grades) to take them just to never use them in industry bc u need higher level education and experience to land those jobs/research. even a master's in ML will probably not get u a job in ML because there aren't many entry level roles in ML. so even with a master's, ur still looking for a normal swe job.\n\nSpeaking in a career-focused perspective, most CS majors just wanna become a SWE and id say the only benefit i got out of intel is that all the higher level classes use python and it helped me switch from java to python in my leetcode. If u jus wanna be a SWE, id take like Info/sysarch or like info/devices or even like info/people for a balanced schedule. the reason i say info is because the classes teach u things u'll actually get asked about in an interview like i was asked about like databases, caching and load balancing (cs 2200 stuff), networking, TCP/IP.

GT is my dream school but I want to ask some questions about some reservations that I have about going to Tech.\n\n1. I've heard the culture at Tech is pretty cutthroat. Is that true? I attended a small liberal arts university for my undergrad and I really enjoyed the collaborative environment there, and I'm worried about going to a school that's a lot bigger and that has a reputation like Tech does. I don't back down from academic challenge (because I'm pursuing a PhD!) but I also don't want to feel like I'm doing it alone.\n2. I have heard the qualifying exam pass rate is 50% and that it is brutal even compared to quals at other top AE programs. Is this accurate?\n3. How is the housing situation for grad students? When should I start searching for apartments if I want to begin leasing in August? Any areas that grad students tend to live - and conversely, any areas to avoid like the plague?\n\nThanks so much!!! I'm so excited",

Each lab is different though so while I didnt experience many of these issues ymmv depending on the lab. No matter the program you choose you will feel like you are going at it alone at some point. I have friends that went to different programs and they too had phases of their program that were difficult and deeply lonely.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n2. The AE program is known for having the hardest quals in the university. However the pass rate accounting for both tries is anywhere from 70-90% depending on the cohort from what I was told and observed\u00a0\n\n\n3. Housing can be tough. See if you can connect with other students coming into the lab/department for roommates and you will be fine. Start looking in March/April to get the lay of the land but a lot of apartments have 60 notice periods so they won't post apartments open for August move in until May/June.\u00a0",

Question 2 is for you to ask someone in the AE program although my roommates can attest to that brutality LMAO (they are 5th year doctoral candidates in AE program). \n\nFor question 1, if you are coming from a LAC (I assume LAC as in like Williams, Amherst, Swarthmore, etc.), expect a cultural shift. GT Ph.D. students are more or less insulated from the rest of the school (by the rest of the school, I mean undergraduates and masters) UNLESS you are a GTA, where you have to interact with non-doctoral students. \n\nYes, there's a collaborative culture, but DO NOT EXPECT your peers to be extremely well-rounded with regard to other aspects (I myself went to a LAC and GT was more academic-focused). After all, you are here to do research, research, and research (with caveats). \n\nWhether you are doing a ph.d. in aerospace or any program, this is GT and learn to be persistent FIRST before you come here in the Fall (or else, you won't like it when the reality hits you). And sadly, loneliness is also real and that's something I and my peers across different programs suffer; but this is not unique to GT. \n\nFor question 3, I don't know about your stipend situation, but look for apartments near school (someone else mentioned Midtown and Homepark already) and I am saying this from my personal experience; in my first year, I lived like 60-90 min commute using MARTA bus and trains, and it crushed my mental health (and to this day, I am still recovering because while the location is safe since it's a recently gentrified area, it was too isolated). Fun fact, I once saw a guy rolling weed, casually putting down his pistol and a broken HP monitor during summer on MARTA.\n\nNevertheless, I do enjoy my life here and I would not trade anywhere even though I trash GT occasionally because that's my beer time conversation (ok maybe except for 1-2 other schools).",

Many people mature in high school, and almost all mature in undergrad. The most cutthroat you'll find is the few bootlickers who will openly argue to the AE faculty that the PhD stipends should *not* be raised (despite being the lowest stipends at GT). Academically, the community here is delightful, especially if you are taking classes with your labmates.\n\n2. The AE quals are archaic and systemically disadvantage students from smaller labs. The big labs (ASDL, SSDL) pair you with senior students to ensure you are prepared for quals and have banks of previous years' questions for study material. Smaller labs don't have that. The quals are challenging, and you'll lose 6-12 months of research output studying for them, but they are doable. The previously mentioned bootlickers defend the AE quals because they gatekeep \"personalities\" that aren't suited for an AE PhD.\n\n3. There is a housing group on Facebook that is popular.\n\nBeyond your questions, I strongly recommend that you reconsider GT AE. The department has a strong reputation, however seriously lags behind other departments, especially in the post-Covid world. GT AE ranks dead last in PhD stipend relative to cost of living for the top 10 AE PhD programs in the US, even behind other GT departments (CS, IC pay $3,200/mo, BME pays even more, AE pays $2,500/mo).\n\nThe AE faculty are stuck in the belief that a PhD is supposed to be 5 years of indentured servitude with just-above-poverty pay and absurdly challenging quals that accomplish little beyond inequitably weeding out students (I know multiple students who were told they should have failed quals but passed because their advisor is so and so). That romance for the \"good old days\" is purely exploitative and is simply not today's reality. Competition for PhD programs is so intense that most admits already have MS degrees and/or work experience. PhD students aren't vulnerable 22-26 year olds anymore, but 25-30 year olds. GT AE still thinks they can get away with paying barely anything for high research output, while virtually every other comparable university (including other departments at GT) has moved on and left GT AE behind. This also doesn't consider that GT's student fees (which also apply to grad students, no matter their coursework status) are among the highest among comparable universities. Around 10% of your salary goes to having the opportunity to be paid minimum wage.\n\nIf you have any choice, I highly recommend choosing another program. I know GT is your dream school, but please, please take this advice seriously. The GT brand is not worth what AE has done to take advantage of its PhD students, and from the recent conversations between AE's GSA and the faculty, has full intention to continue doing.",

However, understand that much of the challenge comes from within, from traits that are inherent in you and the reason you were accepted in the first place. Because you have what it takes to make it!\n\nWhat does this mean? If you choose to attend; it will be incredibly stressful. You will feel the imposter syndrome. You will strongly consider quitting, and your reasons will be valid. Your grades will be lower than ever before. And very likely, you will eventually have a mental breakdown (often within the first year).  None of this is meant to imply that \"you are incapable or lesser\" in any way. But setting these expectations in advance will help you to perservere when you are at your lowest. Because if you already got admitted, you can do it!  It's up to you to not give up; that is the final test.\n\nAs for housing; i've heard that Home Park (the area on the immediate north side of campus) is well known for robberies. But it is so close, and affordable, that it is a popular place for students. If you can afford a little more, i know many people that live on the east side of campus that are much happier. Meanwhile, south and west of campus, depending on distance from school, gets pretty sketchy... i would avoid these two areas.\n\nLastly, myself and a few final grad students choose to live in the suburbs and drive to campus. This distant north gets much cheaper than downtown/midtown, and places are bigger and nicer... but you pay with your driving time. Our commute is about 20-30 minutes, and im probably the furthest at about 30 minutes away, living in Marietta. 3 or 4 live in Dunwoody.",

Or do you have other AE Ph.D admission offers and will you be doing a Ph.D no matter what?\n\nThe GTAE doctoral program can either be adored or despised depending on your perspective. Both perspectives are valid. Whether those of us who are familiar with the program (or at least with the department, as in my case) should encourage you or discourage you from spending half a decade of your life there really depends on what your alternatives are. \n\nSSDL \u2014 which I assume is your lab given your comment about astrodynamics/GNC \u2014 is a great lab and you\u2019ll likely be a part of fantastic research, and you may or may not be actively involved in flight projects as well. \n\nAt the same time, SSDL/GTAE is neither the only place, nor the absolute best place, where you can do either or both of those things. For example, given your interests, I wouldn\u2019t tell you to pick Tech over Boulder... There is a higher concentration of true astrodynamicists there, as well as at Purdue and Austin, so if you wanted to go down that path I\u2019d probably point you in that direction. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d put GTAE in general above all other top AE schools in any other subfield other than pure systems engineering. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I can empirically confirm the other comment about Ph.D students from smaller labs having a harder time passing their quals.

Because permitting, building, approvals etc are the way they are, the latter will take a few years to realize. But the former can be realized immediately, and should be IMO. Tech can and probably should drop the instate admit rate to make the school a bit more competitive and also decrease the pressure on infrastructure. The impact of that on prestige is a separate conversation but from where I stand it isn't a bad thing.   \n\n\nPrimary, admin needs to recognize that GT cannot grow by a huge amount without growing its services. While decreasing admit rates to give infrastructure more breathing room may decrease access, it lets GT make school itself cheaper by increasing how many people can be on-campus and not pay inflated rates off campus.",

If you want Tech to admit fewer students, the number of OOS and international students would have to drop too.\u00a0\n\n60% is not an unreasonable percentage given Tech is a public university. Most of our public peers have much harsher in-state/OOS restrictions than that. UNC is required by the NC legislature to be 82% in-state. UT Austin is always over 90% in-state because of its unique admissions process. UVA is required by its state legislature to be 2/3rds in state IIRC. The State of CA recently dropped the hammer on OOS admissions in the UC System.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely not a bad thing that the State of GA wants to keep schools 60% in-state and should the opposite happen, you\u2019ll get a situation like CA where several schools are on Tech\u2019s level but the general perception (which does not match reality) is that none of them are actually accessible to students from CA.

They may be pricier than other areas but you can still have excellent service and food. I really think most of the tourism-oriented  businesses want you to have a great time. Dublin is not Rome, Paris, Venice, or London in that regard. Those cities have plenty of scams being run on tourists, like just never try to eat near the Colosseum or the Eiffel Tower. My advice in any city is to check reviews but also ask locals for recommendations if you can.",

Of course we had all the pieces though (localization, etc.), just nothing simultaneous for a SLAM implementation.\n\nI'd also highly recommend CS 4644 (deep learning).

However, everyone around you at Tech is just like you in terms of the level of success they had in high school. A new bell curve is made out of brilliant students from all over the world when you start out at a school like this - which means that being an \u201caverage\u201d student isn\u2019t a bad thing at all. \n\nMy advice would be to do your best to remove your grades from being a part of your self-worth at all. It is important to realize that you are much more than whatever grade you got on your last test. Tech is a grueling experience for most every student, and heaping more stress and pressure on yourself isn\u2019t going to do any good. \n\nThere will be highs and lows, but I promise it will all even out in the end. I can tell you from my own experience that my very worst grade at Tech (a D) was in a class regarding a very specialized field. I ended up getting a job in that very same field, and have been very successful in my career so far relative to my peers. It goes to show that a grade isn\u2019t even necessarily an indicator of future proficiency in that subject, so why go as far to let it determine the way you view yourself as a person? \n\nJust do your best, join some clubs, get involved with some cool projects and enjoy the ride! It will be over before you know it, and you\u2019ll be looking back on your time at Tech with fond memories.",

However, I\u2019m mostly concerned about the competitive culture. I knew it would difficult, but I\u2019d heard my classes would be more collaborative than I\u2019ve experienced them to be. I\u2019ve found it very hard to do group work or ask for help in my classes. I\u2019ll reach out to my group with questions about lecture or hw and they will either not respond or say they didn\u2019t see my message until after the hw/exam passes. I\u2019m fine with going to OH, but I feel some questions don\u2019t need to be directly answered by the professor when a simple text can suffice. At my old school my friends and I would study together and help each other as much as possible. I just thought that was the norm. I get the vibe that students here think helping others is in some way disadvantaging them. So I ask\u2026does it get better? Is this just typical of intro courses and people will warm up over time? I\u2019m seriously contemplating switching schools again. I\u2019m tired and just want to be settled in somewhere. App deadlines are coming up and I need to figure out what to do. What are y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",

All the other students had already found their groups and it has been a challenge to make friends with them (partly also because I'm an introvert). They all study together, while I do my homework alone. I've also haven't been able to establish a bond with my roommates either. It's tough sometimes, but GaTech was also one of my dream schools. I'm grateful to my PI who took me in his lab, and I love the work I get to do here. I think it's a slow process, especially if you transfer over. It's not all that bad though. My labmates have been very nice, and they've kept me going so far. I also managed to talk regularly to a few folks in my classes.Try joining a club, or sign up for activities! I think it will take time, and will be slow as hell, but I guess you gotta push through if everything else is to your liking.",

It\u2019s a very fulfilling experience that can be very ruthless at times.\n\n That said, expecting group members to answer questions about lectures or material that you have is very unrealistic. These are students/peers that are likely struggling to balance their own studies and lives, just like you.  They aren\u2019t tutors or TAs, or even people that have signed up to be in a peer study group.  They certainly have no obligation to teach class material via text message.  What might feel like quick questions to ask likely would take a meaningful amount of thought and time to put a response together for you.\n\nExpecting other students to give their time to help you out in your classes is a not a normal expectation to have.  If you find a friends group that makes time to study together, that\u2019s awesome and those things exist. But that\u2019s not what the group in a group project is meant for. If you need help learning the material so that you can contribute to the group assignments, that\u2019s really on you to find mechanisms meant to help people study/learn.  Office hours like you mentioned, study groups, tutors, etc.\n\nGood luck!",

I'm at a small liberal arts school now (saving money and time) and am graduating next year with a pure science major. I've made a couple friends and also just everyday mundane things seem nicer at my new school (pretty campus, friendlier students/profs, less people in classes, etc.) I'm not going to lie, I was a little worried about how transferring so many times might look to future applications but I was just accepted into an internship at an ivy with that on my record so idk how much it matters.

I imagine its similar at other stem heavy schools and less so at schools with more diverse majors but thats just a common assumption that I think its true off anecdotal evidence. \n\nIf I had to guess why, I would say it is that the school doesn't invest a ton into social events especially if you arent a freshman, and that most students either don't want to hang out with irl friends or are way too busy from their classes after like week 2 (this one is usually my experience). \n\nThe only real options to meet people here most of the time are classes and clubs which are great and I have made friends through my clubs, but can be limiting if you cant put in the time investment into a club or dont really match with a specific club",

I transferred in from way south ga in Spring 2008 and almost flunked out within 6 weeks. Ultimately, I changed majors, cut back my hours at work, and really spent time figuring myself out and spent time asking myself what I really wanted. I got in as a nuclear major, but changed to electrical and it was the best decision I ever made. I then reached out during my second semester in the fall to the email lists for the entire DSP class asking if anyone wanted to study - and a few people responded that I still consider great friends today. I got out in May 2011 and wouldn't change a thing - especially the difficult soul searching.\n\nI think alot of the pressure and self doubt for me came from constantly being told I was smart or clever by friends and family and being a relatively big fish in a backwater small pond. The best advice for that is find what makes you happy, latch onto it, and see where it leads. I still remember there was one particular day that the sun came out and I sat outside in the garden across from the library with some good music playing and then I remember just riding the bus a couple laps around campus aimlessly. Something about it just felt good.\n\nHang in there and if you need any support, I and many others are here for you. It takes hard work and dedication to get what you want, but sometimes you might realize that you gotta shake things up a bit or find your stride.",

It's a much better idea to have each bin type in the same location. Going to a further bin the app suggested is even more friction.\n\nI could see using something like wave an item over an edge device right above the trash bins that identified the item.",

I will definitely mention this issue with the GT recycling coordinator Malte Weiland and see if we can get some improved signage on those bins this semester.\n\nContamination is definitely one of the primary issues we are trying to address by giving accurate rules through the ECGO app, but you are right, signage is immediately accessible and we have heard anecdotes from some recycling coordinators that great signage can lead to both lower contamination and higher engagement.\n\nIn regards to your idea about edge devices, both Scrapp and Oscar Sort are trying out these approaches with mixed success. The unfortunate aspect of edge devices is their upfront cost, continued maintenance, and propensity to be stolen. Furthermore, we believe that although there are improvements to be made at the bin, the biggest oversight in recycling in the US is the lack of community/culture and direct incentives. We believe these are best delivered and scaled through an in-app experience and we have big plans to substantially improve both for the Fall semester.",

By comparing the clusters by the number of bins within and the number of images taken, we get a basic view into how well supported an area's waste stream is. Furthermore, we do physical waste audits to measure if areas with greater ECGO activity have less contamination in their waste streams",

Seems like pretty bad advice, but let me explain:\n\nAt least from what I've seen, most people that go to clubs are there for an hour and just leave and return the next week. I pulled the same thing my first two semesters at Tech and I felt the same way. Honestly, that is expected. I think many people forget that a club isn't just a 1 hour a week thing, but something you actively engage in. You get what you put in. If you go for an hour and don't stick around after meeting chatting with people, you find yourself in that position where you go home and think \"Time to wait another week to go back to club to talk to no one\". For a ton of the people I see attend aniclub (the club Im most active in), they never really stick around to hang out after we are finished watching shows and I never get the opportunity to meet them because of that. I can say the same for myself when I stayed in my dorm 90% of the day and didn't try to go to unofficial club events. No one ever got the opportunity to talk to me because I never gave myself the chance to put myself out there and try to start conversation after/during meeting times.\n\nThat is where I think clubs like D&amp;D and Anime Club shine. D&amp;D I think is the more obvious example of this. You aren't actively playing D&amp;D (p2e on top btw) during club. Instead, you find a game and play it outside of club time. Before you know it, you are actively hanging out with the people you play with on the weekends outside of session because you put yourself in that situation where you form bonds. For anime club, we have a channel called #culc-cult in the discord where most people will ping if we are all hanging out in Crosland or we will post when we all go out to dinner after meetings, or even board game night. If you look hard enough, every club has something like this.\n\nAnyways I'm writing all of this to say to not let that twice a month meeting time limit you. Maybe message the main slack or discord channel and see if anyone wants to make plans, or if that is too much, try taking small steps and meeting a couple people that regularly attend and hang out with them",

That stuff doesn't normally bother me, it was going on last semester but this semester it just got way way worse. With this music playing all the way across the student center and having heard songs graphically describing fingerbanging and violence against women, it's really a problem. Even more so because this was during the swim meet yesterday where hundreds of children are getting lunch at chick-fil-a, and kids are touring the school, its a really bad look for us.\n\nI'd honestly like it if they just turned the music off entirely, because it's hard to study with that going on constantly, but please at least stop playing constant explicit music.",

You enjoy being blasted with royalty free music like you have some kind of anti homeless architecture fetish.\n\n\nLike bro, if you want music so bad feel free to wear headphones- they have the added benefit of playing whatever you want! If you legitimately enjoy listening to the same top fifty pop songs someone chose for you idk what to tell you man, you\u2019re cooked. You probably have subway surfers gameplay going while you\u2019re in lecture.\n\n\nIt just really takes away from the versatility of the Stucen.

The student center hosts events like open mics, concerts, and there's even a dedicated space for the musician's network to mess around with instruments. And these things can go on past 10. The student center literally wasn't designed to be a study space, it was made for students to hang out, socialize, eat, and be entertained. Of course there will be music. If OP thinks the music is too explicit, that's a valid complaint. However, complaining that you can't study in the student center really isn't. Taking away the one recreational building just to make it yet another study space is ridiculous.",

There is no mandatory clinical experience, that\u2019s rare in most programs you don\u2019t need it for abr/campep anymore but you can get it if you do research and apply for Emory etc. I am happy I chose it because I already live in atl and I went to GT. (I am listed as a master but swapping to a PhD, the only different is 2 years, 9 credit hours ish)",

I didn't get into residency for the 2020 start date, so I ultimately came back for my PhD, which I expect to finish in the next few months. My research is specifically with a professor at Emory, which has been really good. I've also been doing clinical work through Emory for several years now, which has also made me a much more prepared and well-rounded applicant for residencies this time around. To me, the biggest downside is the city itself, which I've been in for way too long. I liked it early on, but I think I need a fresh start, or at least somewhere outside of Midtown.",

There\u2019s always people in the discord looking to start/join bands or just do jam sessions. Also, if you\u2019re looking for something less \u2018structured\u2019, there\u2019s open mic every Thursday, and oftentimes someone will sign up to just play a jam and ask random people if they\u2019d like to join. Also most Thursdays at mid-day is groovy Thursday, where people just jam/improv music outside the student center. Would recommend both for ya!",

Since you did your undergrad at GT, you should know some professors that you have a good rapport with. If you\u2019re going to work with any of them, mail them ahead of time and talk about your interest and that you\u2019re going to be coming back to school. That would help you get in for sure.",
