                            "body": "**Item #:** SCP-GT \n\n**Object Class:** ~~Euclid~~ Keter (Reclassified following the \"Incident of 17\")\n\n~~Special Containment Procedures: SCP-GT is to be contained within a habitat enclosure at Site-\u2588\u2588 that simulates an urban campus environment, complete with artificial turf and structures reminiscent of a traditional college campus. The enclosure must be equipped with advanced security measures to prevent SCP-GT from breaching containment, including electromagnetic barriers, motion sensors, and a 24/7 surveillance system. Interaction with SCP-GT is to be limited to personnel with Level 3 clearance and above, and any maintenance or research within the enclosure must be conducted under strict supervision. Personnel engaging with SCP-GT must wear standard issue protective gear to prevent potential harm caused by SCP-GT's unpredictable behavior. In case of a containment breach, Protocol GT-Alpha is to be initiated, involving the use of specialized acoustic devices designed to pacify SCP-GT and guide it back to its enclosure. Description: SCP-GT appears as a large, metallic creature resembling a yellow jacket wasp, an entity closely associated with the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). Despite its metallic structure, SCP-GT exhibits organic behaviors such as territorial displays, vocalizations reminiscent of traditional college chants, and high levels of agility and strength. SCP-GT possesses the ability to inspire and invigorate individuals around it, particularly those affiliated with or supportive of Georgia Tech. SCP-GT's origin remains unknown, but it was first contained following a series of events at Georgia Tech where it was observed leading rallies and participating in sports events, causing significant disturbances due to its anomalous abilities and the fervor it incited in the populace. Addendum GT-1: SCP-GT has demonstrated a unique ability to affect technological devices within its vicinity, often causing them to operate at significantly enhanced efficiency levels. This effect seems to be beneficial, although the potential for SCP-GT to inadvertently compromise electronic security measures necessitates further study. Addendum GT-2: Incident GT-5 occurred on \\[REDACTED\\], when SCP-GT breached containment during the annual \"Homecoming\" event at Georgia Tech. SCP-GT was observed leading a parade, with numerous individuals, both students, and faculty, following it in a state of heightened excitement. The event resulted in minor property damage but no casualties. SCP-GT returned to its containment voluntarily after approximately 2 hours. The incident has led to a revision of containment protocols to include countermeasures for specific Georgia Tech events.~~\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Following the \"Incident of 17\", SCP-GT's containment protocols have been significantly revised. SCP-GT is now housed in a high-security Keter-class containment facility at Site-\u2588\u2588, specifically designed to mitigate its enhanced capabilities and prevent any form of external influence or escape. The containment facility is equipped with multiple redundant security layers, including electromagnetic barriers capable of nullifying SCP-GT's anomalous effects, vibration-dampening walls to counteract its acoustic influence, and a Faraday cage to prevent its interaction with electronic devices. All personnel interactions with SCP-GT, including maintenance, research, and security operations, are to be conducted remotely or via autonomous drones. Direct human contact is strictly forbidden without approval from the O5 Council, given SCP-GT's demonstrated ability to manipulate human emotions and technology. In the event of a containment breach, Protocol GT-Kappa is to be immediately enacted, involving site-wide lockdown, deployment of Mobile Task Forces equipped with specialized anomalous countermeasures, and activation of the site's Scranton Reality Anchors to negate SCP-GT's abilities.\n\n**Description:** SCP-GT is a highly advanced, anomalous entity with the appearance of a metallic yellow jacket wasp, emblematic of the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). SCP-GT exhibits both organic and mechanical characteristics, with the ability to exert control over technology and influence human emotions, particularly those related to competitiveness and loyalty to Georgia Tech. SCP-GT's reclassification to Keter was necessitated by the Incident of 17, where it demonstrated previously unseen capabilities, including mass emotional manipulation, spontaneous generation of technological constructs, and a significant resistance to previously effective containment measures.\n\n**Addendum GT-1:** The Incident of 17 occurred during an unauthorized testing phase, where SCP-GT managed to override its containment field, resulting in a campus-wide blackout and the temporary loss of control over several Foundation assets. SCP-GT mobilized a large group of civilians and personnel, instigating a large-scale event that mimicked a campus riot. The incident resulted in multiple casualties and significant damage to Foundation property.\n\n**Addendum GT-2:** SCP-GT's influence over technology and human behavior is more profound than initially assessed. It can induce a highly competitive and aggressive state in individuals, significantly enhancing their physical capabilities and technological understanding, albeit at the cost of their rationality and awareness of their surroundings.\n\n**Note:** SCP-GT has become a subject of interest within the Foundation not only for its unique characteristics but also for the potential application of its technology-enhancing abilities. Research proposals aimed at understanding and possibly harnessing this aspect of SCP-GT are currently under review. However, SCP-GT's ability to inspire extreme loyalty and its control over technology pose a significant threat not only to the structural integrity of the Foundation but also to the global balance of power should its influence extend beyond containment. Ongoing research focuses on understanding the full extent of SCP-GT's capabilities and developing more effective containment and countermeasures.",

In this case I would instead shift to thinking of how I can make it easier for my future self to do the work. I can pull out my laptop and open up the problem set from canvas. That's easy. I'll work on it later but I've done that step. I can take out my notes from the past week so they're ready for me to look through them. Not stressful. Well, now that I have it open, I but I can at least read through the problems, even if I need to study later to fully understand them. If some feel easy to knock out, maybe I'll start them now, maybe later. Right now it's late, if I think  I'm not going to be productive tonight anyway, I can force myself to sleep (or just rest in bed without devices) make sure I waking up earlier and I'll have everything ready for me to start\n\nThis method isn't a panacea, but it is something that cumulatively made a big difference over my years at Tech.

Failed every single one of them. \n\nI reached a point where I was so irritated, so hateful, so dissapointed with myself, with how I was living my life, with the amount of work I was getting done, with my direction in life, that I hit this rock bottom. It was like this implosion of hate that finally ignited a something in my heart that made never again be that hateful and dissapointed with myself, this burning desire to *be better.*\n\nAnd so I started living my life/studying with imagining *the person that I would be proud of* versus *who I was now*. By working towards an *ideal* and away from my biggest demon: laziness (procrastination, partying, videogames.), I had my motivation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what Im talking about isnt a trick, or a tip, for getting into a 4 hr work session. Its a paradigm change. Its a different perspective for living life. The problem is not you cannot find you motivation externally in the world, I believe it is that you do not have motivation existing in your heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet the world go for a few. Take some time. Go to a mountain top or something. Write in a journal. Find what you want to work towards, a dream, a goal, and let your passion for the future or your hate for the present spurn your will for change. *This*, in the long run, will give you motivation that burns for much longer than 11:55 pm energy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, just for clarification, this is my own way of seeing things, and I know I said a lot, probably an unexpected response. I dont mean to convince you or \"convert\" you or anything like that. Just sharing some of my thoughts that I think could help you.",

            "selftext": "I'm in a project based class and having trouble communicating at all with my prof. My groupmate emailed them (on a Friday) for the first big assignment (due on a Monday) because there was no rubric or real guidelines posted for it. No response, and we all got docked off 10%+ for not including items that were never specified to us. Only feedback was to \"answer more specifically\". \n\nThis week, we have a pretty critical discrepancy in our results ie it makes no physical sense. We group emailed the TA and prof on Wednesday, only got a response from the TA saying they were unsure and asking the prof if they have any ideas. We emailed back to the group email both yesterday and today, still no response from prof. This assignment is also due Monday before class, which is the only time we see the prof in person. I wish I had the foresight to identify future obstacles (on Monday, when we see them in class) we may run into for an assignment assigned Wed and due Mon, but alas. Any outside of class communication feels impossible. \n\nOffice hours are by appointment only, which is kind of difficult to schedule if we just get ghosted by email. I pulled up to their office a couple times and they were not there. We're just gonna have to BS this assignment and chalk it up to human errors probably, even though I'm 99% sure there's more to it than that. But in the future, how do we deal with an unresponsive prof if the TA is unable to help? Just deal and survive the semester? Anyone else we can go to outside of the instructional team? I'm almost out of here, this just sucks. Thanks friends \ud83e\udee1",

Adjusting to France is a little bit tough, but it's all worth it, plus you get much closer to your friends through travel and adjusting. I've made some great memories that would each take way too long to write about, but I think its a great program that you should absolutely do.",

Our quartet includes several Tech alums, and we love singing back on campus and hope you'll want to send us somewhere fun this year.\n\nIf you want us to sing for your loved one (or embrarrass your professor, or annoy your roommate), DM me for more info or go to [atlantavocalproject.com/valentines](https://atlantavocalproject.com/valentines) to sign up for a time slot.

Expensive rent and cheap prices don't mix very well, this is why everything in Midtown is expensive or a chain. You can overcome this with a large customer base, but a new restaurant won't have it, and Tech students seem incredibly unwilling to try anything outside of the norm. \n\nI DO think students have unrealistic expectations about prices though. It's *very* difficult to find a complete meal for under $10 these days outside of the cheapest fast-food places.",

I just don't think it's feasible to open a proper restaurant because to have any type of 'authentic' feel, you need a lot of spices and condiments that require (in the US) non-native ingredients meaning that if you want authentic food, it's $30 or more if you want it to be a full meal but those types of restaurants don't really suit the lifestyle of a college student. So I think it's not really feasible, on the other hand, I'm really surprised there isn't a food truck of pani-puri/dosas and indian snack food, I think that's pretty doable",

I'm a student at GaTech, and I borrowed a Microsoft Surface laptop from the college for coursework. Unfortunately, I entrusted my laptop to a friend to submit in the library, but he mistakenly handed it over to the IT department instead.\n\nNow, the library is insisting that they never received the laptop, and they're asking me to pay a hefty $1500 fee. When I approached the IT department, they claimed they don't have the laptop either. I'm at a loss for what to do next.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation before? Are there any steps I can take to track down my laptop or resolve this issue with the library and IT department? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!",

My PI; however, did not tell me that I would need to be using the web-clock on OneUSG to log my hours. This was a miscommunication on their part as they likely assumed I was already using it for my other position, which I am not because my supervisor puts in our time manually. \n\nSo, I worked 9 hours during the first 2 weeks of school and did not log them, which means I was not compensated. I immediately emailed them when I figured that out and their attitude was very much \u201cyou should\u2019ve logged them\u201d and they essentially ignored any email I sent requesting and update on whether or not they were able to get in contact with payroll and fix it.\n\nThese past 2 weeks, I made sure to log my time. There were some mistakes on my timesheet because the website is super glitchy so it logged my in time on one position and despite me setting the page to be on that position, switched to my other position when I punched out so that had to be corrected. I worked over 11 hours over the past 2 weeks and this morning I noticed that my time had been changed to 5.2 hours, which means I am now missing 15 hours worth of compensation. \n\nI also put in an inquiry with OneUSG and apparently my PI is the only one who can fix it \ud83d\ude42\n\nI emailed my PI about this again and included the live document my team has been using to log our hours week to week, but I\u2019m almost positive they\u2019re going to ignore it and at this point I\u2019m considering not working at all until I am fairly compensated.

If that doesn\u2019t work then you probably need to ask your PI if you all can set up a meeting with whoever in your department works with grants to see the most appropriate solution to getting the back pay fixed. If the PI stonewalls you at that point your options are (1) ombud (2) Dean of students (3) department chair. Not in that order specifically. \n\nUsually the best course of action is to find a way to resolve the issue without requiring additional paperwork. You may have slightly higher taxes inputting in more hours but at the number of hours you are putting in it would be negligible and wouldn\u2019t affect your overall end of year tax burden. \n\nUnfortunately these issues are not gatech or even higher education specific, though you see them happen at research universities when faculty who are trained in X field are tasked with work beyond their training (finance, administration, etc.) bc we in academia somehow think a PHD and a faculty job grant us magical powers. \n\nHope this helps.\n\nOne last note: a good phrase to have in your arsenal now and forever is \u201cI can\u2019t continue to work without appropriate compensation, what can we do to resolve this issue? Who can we talk to to get this resolved?\u201d Approach it as a problem to solve together not as an adversarial situation, and it can help. But stand your ground on getting a timely resolution.",

They won't do anything without your PI instructing them to, but they can tell you the general process that should be followed and give a realistic estimate of the timetable in general. \n\nKnow that OneUSG is absurdly frustrating for pretty much everyone. The board of regents forced it down our throats a few years ago. So it's possible, POSSIBLE,  that your PI has started whatever process is needed but it just takes time, so nothing to say. Also possible PI has no idea and just needs to refer you to the right accounting person. Still I agree that responding to your email would be presumably appropriate.\n\nTakeaway: there's probably a dedicated person in your school whose sole job is to handle student hiring. Find out who that person is and talk to them.",

But also, you are robbing your team of productivity. Those that rely on you will recognize that they cant/shouldnt rely on you... which may decrease future growth potential and hinder getting recommendation letters.  On the flip side, working hard through issues can be a positive note on recommendation letters.\n\nEdit: Of course, as with all work issues, the best course of action is largely influenced by the trustworthiness/professionalism of those involved. So if your PI has a history of being unprofessional and screwing over others, then i would ignore my prior advice... and likewise, immediately quit and not ever work with them.",

This will vary by department/building and where exactly you're getting your funding from. \n\nI wouldn't withhold work, but if needed elevate this above your PI if they aren't being responsive.

To be honest, your relationship with your PI is more valuable in the long term if you have any designs for graduate school, so keep that in mind before you might cause a schism. To resolve the hours issue, go talk to the department office your PI is in to talk to the finance person. They have ultimate authority over this, not your PI.",

I will say that it used to be centered on a groupMe chat and before that it was centered on a Facebook group. I think that discord is a good platform for these kinds of things although discover ability isn't amazing, there is an official campus integration on discord that allows you to link servers to a particular campus but I'm not sure how used / useful it is.",

I honestly don\u2019t like groupme because of the UI and lack of features for group management and organization; I think discord does it much much better in that regard. The campus integration isn\u2019t bad either, as it allows students to directly search to see if there\u2019s a club they are interested in, but as for finding small interest groups, it\u2019s a bit harder in that regard since the servers are sorted by member count.",

I'm a grad student in my last semester so I won't be around for too long but I've joined the discord for this semester. For the project we're also interested in how to get people to meet up in-person on campus. In the old photography club we did I think bi-weekly meetings with photo &amp; editing critiques and competitions on the overhead projectors; workshops on different techniques and technical aspects of photography. Also club trips to places like the Atlanta Zoo and Botanical Gardens, I think some areas of the Greenway etc. Thanks for creating the Discord though, I think that there definitely should be a photography group on campus as a club or otherwise.",

Check the syllabus beforehand so you can be well-informed of their policies, but still ask even if the syllabus mentions the official channels. Depending on if you plan to pursue option 3, be frank but professional. Technically they're supposed to ask you to keep details confidential, but a little honesty can go a long ways. Above all, COVID has encouraged them to insist that you not come when truly sick. Do with that info what you will, considering periods aren't contagious XD\n\nIf the prof requests proof or you suspect will be difficult: \n\nOption 2: STAMPS\n(The one time I managed to get an appt they were closed when I got there. No particular advice. I have heard that the women's health department is pretty good from a decent amount of ppl, but overall the place has a rather mixed bag of feedback.)\n\n\nOption 3 (particularly if stamps has no appts, if you are in too much pain to want to leave, and/or have insurance that covers it nicely) teledoc or other virtual appt. Your goal is a doctor's note, that goes to the office of the dean. They send you an official letter back to forward to the prof, but bewarned, how exactly any makeup is handled still depends on the prof. I recommend checking their syllabus still. Obviously what the doc writes on the note depends on the person, and on what you say or ask (including Rx)\n\n\nAs a fellow woman, I agree with these other commentors that you should seek medical advice if you can!",

This involved reorganizing our list, introducing new item categories, and consolidating from 1000+ items to just over 200.\u00a0\n\nIn collaboration with recycling coordinators, we've been working to gather accurate information on the recyclability of each item. Today, we're excited to announce that this updated information is now live!\u00a0\n\n**What This Means For You** \ud83d\udc65\u00a0\n\nPrior to obtaining this revised list, our team and app were operating with outdated information. As a result, some recyclable items submitted by our users (*you amazing folks*) may have been erroneously rejected.\n\nRest assured, our team spent this last weekend meticulously reviewing all user submissions to rectify any mistakes. However, we want to ensure you are well-informed. Please feel free to check your deposit history, and if you notice any discrepancies, don't hesitate to reach out to support within the app or send us an email at [hello@ecgo.co](mailto:hello@ecgo.co).\n\nWe genuinely appreciate your understanding and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t yet downloaded the app, join us by signing up through the link below! \ud83d\udc47\n\n[ECGO: Snap. Recycle. Reward!](https://ecgo-mobile.app.link/8Qb0JzxMWGb)\n\nThank you for being part of our eco-conscious community! \u267b\ufe0f\n\nBest regards,\u00a0\n\nRyan and the ECGO Team",

However, blood tests and other types of exams can be expensive (but still cheaper! than in many non-campus clinics) depending on what your symptoms are. I had some gallbladder-liver issues last semester and paid about $500 in blood tests (but it was a LOT of blood tests), which I now have a claim with my outside insurance for, trying to get it back.\n\nSchool insurance is really unnecessary because it's way more expensive per semester than any out-of-pocket you would possibly pay. Also, if you are lucky to have outside insurance, you can always either file a claim, or the doctor will send you to outside institutions for any CT/MRI/other medical tests that require a referral. And with outside insurance, these tests go down in price from thousands of dollars to literally 40 bucks. Even blood tests tbh, but I didn't realize this early enough.\n\nIf you don't have even outside insurance, then you are more unlucky, but at the very least you should go to a doctor's visit because they are free. And even though you'll pay out-of-pocket for the blood tests, you should still take them if your doctor wants you to, because blood tests have valuable information that could narrow down your diagnosis. Then at least you'll know how serious your condition is, and you could start talking about options. One thing to remember is that stress alone can cause so many weird conditions, that if you are constantly in stress, it's worth considering ways to destress, or minimizing stressors because they can seriously detrimental to your health. And you'll know if your stress levels are through the roof enough for this to be a possible cause.",

However, it looks like I'll be completing my degree requirements only by summer. I've already filled out the OAG because I still want to participate in the May commencement ceremony, but I'll have to reach out to OIE a week or two before May, to withdraw my application (quite a hassle).\n\nShould I apply for an early walk instead? What are the odds of approval for an early walk, and would that be a better option for me?",

Nelson and Shell, this semester alone, has had the water cut off completely atleast 5 times now, each times lasting many hours past their emailed time expectations. \n\nNot only this, but on unrelated occasions the hot water is turned off with no prior warning. Today the hot water has been turned off again, and there was literally no email sent. I had to call the office and be told that the hot water was turned off. \u201cIt should have been emailed.\u201d The \u201cit should\u201d seems to be their go to at this point. It should but it never actually is. \n\nNot to mention the fact that The director for Nelson Shell, literally ignored my emails twice. Each time for separate issues. She\u2019ll respond to the first one asking for more information, and then never actually acts or even has the common decency to reply to my email with additional information. What\u2019s ironic is that the first email has plenty of information to begin with\u2026. \n\nI could write a 3 page paper about all of the issues of the dorm, but it\u2019s pointless because housing could literally care less.",

They got the flooding under wraps in okay time (like, just one full day) but would not help dry out his flooded room. Say Friday it leaked, Sunday they put those floppy gray pads in his room and the living room. Monday they came and removed the pads and fucked off. Tuesday they came and then talked to one of the roommates and left. Finally by Wednesday they put some damn fans in his room. Meanwhile he couldnt sleep in that undoubtedly biohazard room and it smelled like ass, so he slept on the couch in the still moist living room. \n\nEvery day he called either emergency maintenance or RA on duty and just got told it wasn't an emergency. Kind of is urgent if you have active mold growing and the things in his room are on a time limit before they get permanently damaged. If they just did their job the first day they came to dry shit out it wouldve been easier for everyone my brother in Christ. Nelson Shell as well btw",

            "selftext": "As a student body, we are very upset with the administration for moving spring graduation from Bobby Dodd, where it has been held the last few years, to McCamish Pavilion. This historic venue has been a goal for many students to walk across the stage and complete their prestigious degree. \nMost of the undergraduates attending this ceremony will be those who did not receive a normal high school graduation ceremony because they are 2020 grads, so this could be the first and only time they and their families would have the chance to see them walk across the stage.\nThe benefit of Bobby Dodd that is also being overlooked is the ability for as many friends and family members to attend graduation. Many students' families have made travel plans around the graduation schedule that has been around for years. Now, these family members may not be able to attend a once-in-a-lifetime ceremony for many because of the ticket limits. We also will not be able to have other friends who have not yet graduated or are in other ceremonies attend the graduation, which has long been a benefit of unlimited seating in Bobby Dodd. \nWe request the Georgia Tech administration and President Cabrera to move the Spring 2024 graduation back to Bobby Dodd. If the weather is inclement, McCamish as an emergency plan is understandable, but it is not understandable why we have this long tradition of walking across Grant Field taken from thousands of Georgia Tech students.",

Also I went to my sister\u2019s graduation during COVID at Bobby Dodd and it was so ducking miserably the sun was just on us the entire time. So far away from the walk way could barely see her. The pictures were essentially worthless. and the stadium is so big for the number of people and students it felt kinda empty. Yea the ticket number limit is better but I\u2019ve never known anyone with an issue getting tickets. There\u2019s plenty of opportunities after the initial ticket allotment to get extras. A lot of people don\u2019t even go to graduation and just give them away. Other aholes sell them. And I think the school also gives away any extras in a lottery type system. I graduated in mccamish twice. And my sister I Bobby Dodd once and we all agreed mccamish was way better",

Your petition is a spit in the face of people with family that have conditions where they can\u2019t sit in the shiny bright Bobby Dodd bleachers in the May heat for 2 hours. Just because you and your immediate contacts want something, does not mean that everyone wants it. You\u2019d think as someone graduating from Georgia Tech you\u2019d have the maturity and sense to realize every system has trade offs and opportunity cost. The cost of this system is 4 tickets, but it\u2019s a good solution that the admin has made the decision for. If you can\u2019t narrow down your family to four people and the rest watch virtually and congratulate after, just don\u2019t take any of them and then they\u2019ll all be equal and you\u2019ll be $1000 richer from selling your tickets",

Especially when a graduation a couple of years ago ended abruptly in the middle of a storm.  And you don't have to deal with May heat or the chilly December wind. I graduated from undergrad last May and was apparently the last group to be able to do that and I personally loved it. Sure the heat sucked, but I enjoyed it getting to buzz around the stadium field while hanging out with my friends who are all graduating and take visit where my friends and family were sitting during graduation was super fun. I also loved getting to easily sit through my other friends' graduation with a large group of my friends. I went to the Spring 2022 and Fall 2022 graduations as well and didn't mind anything and liked it. \n\nIn my personal opinion, I think if all the conditions are right then Bobby Dodd is better, but McCamish has way more advantages from a planning perspective and is a safer option for the admin to plan with. There are less issues to worry about and it is the comfortable option. The main issue is the ticketing limits. This past Fall's graduation was in McCamish and it was annoying that I wasn't able to some of my friend's graduations. I got lucky and one guy had an extra ticket for me but other than that, it can be pretty hard. It requires you to know a lot of graduates who might have an extra ticket or be willing to pay someone for a ticket. As far as I know, besides the roll call which is luck-based and you have to go pretty early to get it, some people who really want to go just won't be able to go. I am graduating with my Master's this spring and I don't even have enough for my whole family, and I'm one of the few left who's graduating so a bunch of my friends won't be able to make it in for the ceremony. McCamish is great that it is indoors but it's size really makes it annoying. I personally am hoping for Bobby Dodd but understand why they're doing it in McCamish.",

You still get to shake Cabrera\u2019s hand and receive a rolled up welcome letter from the alumni association. There\u2019s also a benefit that with smaller ceremonies, you spend less time just sitting there listening to names of people you don\u2019t know until you perk up for the ones you do know.\n\nThere is the caveat of the ticket limit, which I do agree is a fair complaint. But it\u2019s not like that completely ruins the ceremony experience for those that can be there. As a 2020 high school grad, my HS ceremony was a bit scuffed, but thankfully *both* ceremonies here have been a step up. Maybe Bobby Dodd feels more \u201ctraditional\u201d with how football has shaped the culture here, but as others have said, McCamish was the actual traditional venue.",

            "selftext": "Since we've had an uncommonly cold winter for Atlanta, a lot of the pipes have burst in old buildings like north avenue. Unfortunately this caused flooding and now they have to do repairs. However, not only were we not informed that these repairs were going underway, we were also not told that they would be going into our apartments without prior warning.\n\nI was taking a test for a class on honorlock when suddenly someone started hammering the wall next to mine. There was also sawing and drilling, just all kinds of noises and there were no emails or no postings about the fact that this would be in my kitchen and living room.\n\nThey also ripped the floor out in the kitchen. My living room is not accessible, it has a giant tarp covering it. The entire space smells like toxic fumes and I wear a mask when I am out of my room.\n\n[They took out the floor of my kitchen without telling me. Now the floor is sticky and it all smells like toxic fumes.](https://preview.redd.it/3pr6c3fno3gc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3542c23c39d3e3cc22c6b24b6fc069860d50da59)\n\n[They took out kitchen cabinets and the wall.](https://preview.redd.it/njzpw89zp3gc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb65a3aef6e80f9941d464554ea16b7ba3e24ad0)\n\n[My living room. They took everything from our cabinets and put it on the floor in the living room. It is unusable.](https://preview.redd.it/npjw7nf1q3gc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6c106497e10abc3b08d240e99f666a873e612a2)\n\nAfter they've been working on my floor for the past 2 weeks (they've been IN my apartment for 3 of those days), we all got the following email. It says we will receive an individual notice if they will do something with our apartment, but I still have not gotten said email...\n\n[Look at this shit](https://preview.redd.it/hlobw6hvn3gc1.png?width=539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b73d036abfb82a9611e535d5590c87f9f6a05e6)\n\nThe cherry on top of this disaster: my ethernet was out for two straight weekends and my roommate lost power to all outlets in his room.\n\nI am extremely upset and disappointed in the way GT is handling this. Anyone else in the same boat?\n\nEdit: I am currently trapped in my room. I woke up and the kitchen floor and bathroom floor were torn out and have this glue on them. A contractor was there and he told me that I can't walk on it. Updating because people dismissed the problem since we were given an email and got 'compensation' (I got $200 dining dollars) for this. Currently requesting to move to another location during repairs. I got an email about my room needing rennovation and to pack up my stuff, nothing can be on the floors or on any desks. I called the housing office today to find out more about the repairs they would be doing and, moving up the chain of command, I am waiting to hear back. I really have to go to the bathroom, so hoping to be able to use it soon (cannot leave room or use bathroom because kitchen floor has paste on it that I was told not to walk on).",

The best possible solution would be to host it in either Mercedes Benz Stadium or State Farm Arena. I believe both would have sufficient capacity to not require ticketing and accommodate the growing class sizes on the floor.",

Given that it was a winter graduation, there were of course less graduates. They held engineering, college of sciences, and masters all in the same ceremony. Due to this, they made the college engineering sit IN THE STANDS INSTEAD OF THE FLOOR. I was a spectator at my own graduation and I was quite unhappy about it. I would assume the same or worse with the larger May graduations if they were to be held inside. Weather is always a factor, but I would rather sit on the field and have my entire family be able to see me walk at graduation after 4-5 years of hard work. Move it back outside.",

Most students complete it in one year (fall, spring, summer), though some students also take the degree part-time (usually completing it over two years). Undergrad BS ALIS majors can also apply to the BS/MS ALIS, a special program that allows students to count some of their BS ALIS credits towards the MS degree and thus expedite completion of the degree. No GRE is required for the application process. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions! I can also connect you to current or past students if you\u2019d like to chat with them about their experiences.",

I will also say that when I was in the program the funding was pretty good. A good bit of my cohort had some sort of GRA that helped with tuition costs. Funding isn\u2019t guaranteed (!!) but that\u2019s a possibility. \n\nThe application requirements were pretty standard:\n\n- Official Transcripts (w/ min. 3.0 GPA), \n- Two letters of recommendation (contact info), \n- Government issued ID, Statement of Purpose(4000 characters), \n- Language Proficiency Assessment Interview (essentially a series of questions that you upload your video recorded answers to in the target language)\n\nThe program course offerings might look a little different depending on your target language, but, from what I know, everyone was generally satisfied with the options! The courses spanned across digital media &amp; culture, topics on sustainability, internships, sociolinguistics, feminism, film, etc. You even get some flexibility to choose outside of the standard list as well. \n\nOne tip I would give is to try and pick your advisor (and meet with them to solidify it) waaaaay ahead of time\u2026 like 1st month of the program ahead of time if you can. That way you can start preparing for your final project/thesis during the entire program. \n\nPM me if you want more from the student perspective! I\u2019d love to chat.",

I applied specifically to this program because my current advisor told me to. \n\nFor context, I'm a Master's student rn, applied in December for the April deadline, yet to hear back. My advisor wrote me a letter and tells me I'll get in but idk. I have a job offer in hand and since I'm an international student, if the PhD offer comes in late, I'll have no choice but to take the job offer and defer my PhD to the next year. \n\nI was wondering if any of the current Robo AE PhDs can give some input on when I can expect to hear back.

That specific app indeed does not work with recent versions of Android and is (as far as we know) no longer maintained by its developers. If memory serves, it throws a less-than-helpful error message if you do try and use it today in the setup process. \n\nThere is a successor to that app which _is_ actively maintained called [\"geteduroam\"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.eduroam.geteduroam) which _does_ work on Android 14. I just ran through it on a Pixel 6a running Android 14 and it worked without any issues. \n\nWe have [a knowledge article](https://gatech.service-now.com/home?id=kb_article_view&amp;sysparm_article=KB0029073) that links to the correct/working app, and also provides specific instructions on manually configuring a connection to eduroam on Android if so desired. \n\nWe *strongly* recommend using the [\"geteduroam\"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.eduroam.geteduroam) app because it easily and properly configures your device to automatically validate the security certificate used when authenticating to eduroam. If you pick \"Do Not Validate\" for \"Online Certificate Status\" (which fewer and fewer Android devices are offering these days), you run the risk of potentially exposing your GT account credentials to a malicious unofficial eduroam network. If you don't want to use the app, that's fine - the KB article linked above also provides the necessary information to validate the certificate's authenticity on the device's first connection to eduroam.",

Regardless, you should pick your major based on your goals, and it seems like you have an interest in building things.  Regardless, I'm not sure if the robotics thread would be for you since it focuses on heavily on math, although I could be wrong about you since you're considering IE.  (Fun fact, the way it turns out a lot of IE majors have to take ECE 2020, and they even have their own sections).\n\nIf you still want to build things, I would recommend looking into doing embedded systems, which something like DSSD + Devices(in CmpE) could help you achieve.  I don't think most people actually want to do \"robotics\" which truly involves hard math, but hey, that might be you.\n\nRegardless, you should try to pick a major and concentrations that align with your specific goals.

Try out different clubs that relate to your major (there are tons of great robotics clubs and the beginning of the semester is the perfect time to start). That is the best way to figure out what field you want to go into long term. As per this class, I know you said that you have never really struggled with school before, but GT is different. You will struggle no matter what major you choose. GT has classes that will challenge you. These sometimes really stink but this rigor is what turns you into a helluva engineer. Do not switch majors because it is difficult. If you want to switch because you are more interested in a different topic, that is fine. But go to office hours, get knack tutoring, ask the TAs for help and DONT SWITCH MAJORS. Even if your GPA takes a hit, you can still find great jobs and it is always always better to do so in a field you are interested in.",

                    "body": "Don\u2019t be shy to escalate issues outside of the standard (OIE iStart) process if it\u2019s a life or death matter. \n\nOIE deals with a huge spectrum of situations \u2014 from processes that are completely passive / routine / non urgent, to legit emergencies that can quite literally put students at risk of deportation, accusations of immigration fraud, or multi-year bans from returning to the US if they don\u2019t get immediate support. I think a mistake that several of us former or current F-1s made/make when dealing with OIE is to not seek support outside of the standard channels when in these urgent situations. The iStart system doesn\u2019t reliably auto-detect levels of urgency, an actual human being has to look at it and say \u201coh shit, this is bad\u201d.\n\nIf you objectively do need *immediate* help, you\u2019ll get help very quickly if you rock the boat. At least this is what I experienced when I went through a couple of nightmare scenarios that completely messed up my immigration status. I would find a way to email an OIE staffer directly \u2014 but again, only for *status-threatening emergencies*, and be polite. Otherwise, for routine (although still stressful) things like needing a new I-20 to travel or work, your need is always going to take a backseat to those of other people who are in situations that put them at risk of losing their immigration status / their ability to finish their degree. That\u2019s just the reality of dealing with an understaffed office that handles both routine paperwork and emergency situations. \n\nTech needs to give OIE a *much* bigger budget, I\u2019ve been saying this for ten years by now. I\u2019ve never gone out of my way to check if their budget is publicly available information \u2014 if so, it should be compared to the budgets of equivalent departments at peer institutions. That\u2019s worth looking into if someone else has the time.\n\nedit: fixed typos",

Always assume that they will take 2-4 weeks to process everything. If they get it done before that, great. If not, it would be fine since you give them plenty of time before the deadline. When you get stuff back, like newly issued I-20, make sure every bit of information is correct before you accept it.  \nAlso, they don't know shit about laws and regulations. Do a lot, and I mean a lot, of research on your own. Save every document and every email transaction including the timestamps in case there is any problem down the line.\n\nI have not had any problems (Went through CPT process 4 times as of now, I-20 travel signatures, SSN, etc.) with them. I try to limit my communication with them so I don't get frustrated by how dumb they can be. Drop-in advising is pretty much a waste of time.\n\nThey take their own time, but you can only control things you can. So, be patient, organized, and give them at least 2-4 weeks.  \nHope this was somewhat helpful lol. If you have any questions feel free to DM me.",

That being said, in the real world, *all* employees and **especially** social media content managers for corporations, sports teams, and the like have to follow rules around what they're allowed to post on social media in a official capacity when representing the entity and what they're allowed to post when representing themselves.\n\nPut another way, if I was the social media marketing manager for American Express, I wouldn't necessarily be putting a fit check on AmEx's instagram account when advertising a new card offering. AmEx doesn't have to have super stiff social media marketing as an alternative though. There's likely a happy medium in between where this IG account can feature stories and authentic (and fun!)  perspectives of many students across the student body instead of just the perspective of this one student. It could almost be run like a gonzo-esque look into what real life as a student looks like within the boundaries of what would be considered appropriate to show in front of parents.\n\nLong story short, I don't really think she's hurting anyone by tagging herself in stories/including her content about herself and some people here *are* clutching their pearls/overreacting BUT I think self promotion seems out of scope and unprofessional for a social media account for an institute of higher education and don't think many social media teams in the corporate world would approve of that approach. **Ultimately, you are being employed to do a service for the school and document the student body as well as get prospective students to engage with us. Using the brand to promote yourself and your own personal account is unprofessional and wouldn't fly if you were to try and do this as a career once you graduate.**\n\nWho cares though... it seems like there are way more important things that deserve our attention these days anyway.",

Also, if you go through the reels section for Georgia Tech\u2019s instagram, she used her own picture for the covers of several videos, whereas she could have selected any of the other frames within the reels more appropriate and relative to GT (campus, groups of students, guests, instead of herself).

I don't mind her running the account, I just think the way she (and I'm saying this is her here because she is the one posting, but I'm sure there are other people on the team instructing her on what they want, no college would let one of their students run the social media account with absolutely no over sight) is trying to make it more personal is not the right fit for our audience",

That said, I'd be willing to bet we will reach full circle when GenAI models become more accessible and make it easy to make a \"professional\" looking post using your org's branding instantly instead of waiting on designers to produce batches of posts.",

It really is a once in a lifetime experience and I miss it all the time. \n\nI initially had similar concerns about missing out on my first semester at Tech and making friends coming back in Spring, but you build a strong friend group with your other study abroad students. It's a group of about 40-50 students and you end up getting really close, especially during the travel portion when you're on the bus A LOT.  During the following Spring semester they typically put all the returning FYSA students in the same dorm so you have a community right away coming back to Tech. My closest friends at Tech are all study abroad friends. And if you're looking to join clubs, they're no harder to join in Spring semester as 95% of clubs have Spring recruiting. \n\nAs far as courses go, classes aren't too bad. You'll take two classes for the first 6 weeks and two for the second 6 weeks so it's easy to manage the workload. You still have to dedicate time to them, but there is more than enough free time to travel (its honestly a travel program with a side of school lol). \n\nDoing a study abroad in your first semester also has the advantage of minimal impact to your degree map. You're also not tied down by clubs, research, jobs, or things like that. \n\nIt's a really awesome program and if you like travel I highly recommend it.  Just lmk if you have more questions!",

You'll end up taking 15 credits for the program (at least in my year). \n\nThe first three weeks you take a health class which is a Tech requirement that you'll be able to get out of the way. \n\nThe 6 weeks at Oxford you'll choose two classes. My year we had English 1 and 2, Differential Calc., History, and a Comp Sci class to choose from. \n\nDuring the travel portion we took two humanities classes (not to be confused with social science classes) which you won't have a choice on. (So, if you are coming in with humanities credits, they could be redundant. Check [Core Area C | Georgia Tech Catalog (gatech.edu)](https://catalog.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate/core-curriculum/core-area-c/) and  [Core Area E | Georgia Tech Catalog (gatech.edu)](https://catalog.gatech.edu/academics/undergraduate/core-curriculum/core-area-e/) to see what counts as humanities or social sciences. You need 6 humanities credits and 12 social science credits at Tech)\n\nFor me, I already had credits that satisfied the humanities requirement of my degree, so the two travel portion classes became fall through credits. My degree wasn't lengthened, but it's definitely a little tighter. The hardest part is just sorting out prerequisites since your map will be a little scrambled compared to the norm. That being said I didn't come in with a lot of credits, so my degree was already extremely tight.\n\nTLDR: depending on your credits it can make your degree map tight (and in rare cases extend it by a semester), but it entirely depends on your major and what credits you have coming in. That being said even though my degree map has been somewhat tightened, it was absolutely worth it to study abroad.",

            "selftext": "I was recently admitted to a graduate program in Aerospace Engineering--starting Fall '24. That notification was very exciting to get, as Georgia Tech is in my top tier of grad school destinations due to the program ranking. All the professors I've talked to there have been helpful and kind.\n\nAmong the rest of the research I've been doing about grad school destinations, I've been looking at the subreddit for each school. I have to say that out all the schools I've looked at, the vibes here on /r/gatech are by far the worst.\n\nGoing based on posts here:\n\n * Pretty much all students are in a really unpleasant headspace and/or deeply dissatisfied with their current life situation\n\n * Campus infrastructure is poor to the point of really noticeable hits to quality of life\n\n * Dining on campus is intolerable, not just uninspiring\n\nIt seems like on the vast majority of posts there will be at least one current student deeply aggrieved about their experience at Tech. Of course everyone is entitled to their opinion and everyone has a different experience, but the negative posts seem so frequent and intense that they give me pause about spending years of my life in that sort of environment.\n\nSo, be truly honest for the sake of an outsider. Are the in-person vibes at Georgia Tech really as miserable as this subreddit can make it seem? Or is it just that Reddit is a safe place to vent?",

I wish we got paid more, but every grad student deserves more pay and we were above average nationally, at least for my department. \n\nGood luck in your choice, though!

Yes some buildings are old, but they are nothing compared to the literal 1930s bathrooms, lack of campus (sorry GSU), and building shutdowns over asbestos that I have seen. \n- I\u2019ve never been to the dining halls, but all the restaurants on campus have been fine. They even have normal prices, which is an outlier on college campuses. Also, there are always a couple of (overpriced) good food trucks on campus. \n\nOverall, GT is a really cool place with an insane amount of really cool shit happening. The academic standards are high, but every professor I\u2019ve had here has been very good at helping students meet that standard.",

He's having a decently good time. Don't misunderstand, he's still got a lot of stuff to do between classes and TAing and research with not enough hours in the day, and he has the usual complaints about some labmate or another, but on the whole he's doing fine. He's not actively talking about it because there's not much to talk about, everything is just...fine.\n\n\nThat said, I think the complaints you raise are kinda irrelevant. Campus infrastructure is totally fine. The building may be dated architecturally but all the lab equipment is in good shape because the PI cares about keeping it that way and puts grant money towards it when needed. Campus housing and dining may be unappealing, but who cares? Atlanta is a major city with world class food and housing; you're not an undergrad, go live off campus!\n\n\nWhen you pick your lab, make sure you're picking your PI. The professors who want to work you to death will tell you so. The professors who respect your work life balance will tell you so. Don't ignore people when they tell you who they are. Talk to the professors, talk to the current students, and pick the vibe you want.\n\n\nIf you're looking for an active social life you can find one. There are grad groups who go out for drinks every week. There are sports games and tailgates if that's your thing. You can find a vibrant social life if you look for it.\n\n\nDon't base your opinion of the school on a bunch of reddit posts. Every grad program is going to be work, and a top tier program like GT is going to be a lot of work. But the school itself is no worse than any of it's top tier peers.",

Excellent opportunities for student orgs, research involvement, connections to industry, etc etc. If you connect with a professor you can often get a TAship as a master's student as well, which comes with a tuition waiver.\n\nIf you are a PhD student, I strongly recommend you go elsewhere. AE is notorious for underpaying students (w.r.t. other universities and even other departments at GT), and recent efforts from the AE GSA to increase the PhD stipend were shot down by the AE faculty. For perspective, PhD students in CS and IC make $3,000-$3,200/month (pre/post quals), while AE and ME students make $2,500 (was $2,400 until this past fall). If you have a car, or average student loans, or medical concerns, or a pet, you will be living paycheck to paycheck. A large proportion of AE PhD students rely on financial support from family to make it through their PhD. AE also does not guarantee funding WHILE ALSO not guaranteeing an advisor, which means if you don't have a TAship or GRAship by early fall, you are on the hook for ~$15k/semester tuition.\n\nVery few departments at top universities hold PhD students to such little regard. AE (or ME) PhD is just not worth the GT brand name.",

So you are possibly seeing those issues amplified here.\n\nAll that said, the AE program is highly respected .  See if you can speak to some grad students in the program.

Some of it has to do with GT and its systems but for many student their personal/professional life just isn't there yet and it's frustrating being a grad student. You work hard but don't see any real fruits from it. If you don't have anyone in your life or at least some immediate family to talk to, life can get difficult.\n- Many students complain that the admin and logistics are slow. Infrastructure can be poor, but I haven't noticed it being a significant problem. Logistics and admin are slow, but again I'm pretty tolerant of it so it doesn't get my goat.\n- I don't know how many grad students actually dine on campus. You should learn how to cook some decent recipes. There are many great restaurants in Atlanta but there are many bad ones as well that are still highly rated for some reason. I'm looking at you, Tacos &amp; Tequilas. There are several others like this. You don't get good pizza in Atlanta unless you really look (thankfully Atwoods is nearby). It's hard to find a decent deli (Reuben's in downtown is great, but far from Tech). Your food options will be limited, even outside Tech dining.\n\nAll in all, you'll have a decent experience and meet cool people if you have a good social support system (at least an immediate family you're close with, which I thankfully have). If you don't have that, it's really tough being stuck in the South for the extended duration of grad school, especially if you're not from here. It can get lonely.",

My first semester here was honestly the worst for me personally. I got A's in my classes, but I was not well mentally and emotionally. That vastly improved the next semester and the year after that (present day) where I formally joined a lab. We all suffer together and have a great sense of camaraderie with each other.\n\nWhat I will say is that you need to find a lab you would like to work with and see the people you might be working with in the future. Even if you like the work itself, the people you interact with daily can make that not worthwhile.\n\nMaybe I'll be seeing you this Fall!",

My BS was in a related, but not identical field. I was also coming from a less academically demanding school where I had been one of the better performing students in my major. In hindsight, I was also a little academically burnt out going into grad school. \n\nAll of that was a recipe for me getting my absolute ass kicked by the expectations of my coursework. I went from being one of the top students at my old school, to being probably at the bottom of my program at the beginning. It was an absolute ego blow. I made the mistake of trying to figure everything out on my own, and continued to do the same things even when they clearly weren\u2019t working. \n\nI ended up getting a D in a core class, which got me on academic probation. It was the lowest point in my life. I felt like an absolute failure. There were days where I questioned if life was worth living. \n\nI ended up taking a year off to decide if grad school was for me. During that time, I came to terms with the fact that there will always be someone smarter or better than you, and you shouldn\u2019t let it crush you when you encounter these people. I also had a little time to reset the academic burnout. \n\nI decided to return after a year, dedicated to finishing my MS. This time, when I had issues grasping something, I didn\u2019t try to grind it out myself. Instead, I figured out who was the best in the class and asked them, \u201cHey, I\u2019m having a little trouble wrapping my head around this. Mind helping me understand?\u201d  No one was ever a jerk, and this approach single-handedly got me through some of the tougher classes. And even if they are just a jerk, oh well. Some people are jerks.   But \n\nHonestly, despite how hard it was at the time, I\u2019m really glad I went through it.  It kinda destroyed my ego. I\u2019m no longer bothered when I meet someone who\u2019s better at something than me. There are 7.9 billion people in the world, at least one of them is gonna beat you. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever accomplished and I\u2019m proud of it.",

I feel stressed out in both UM and Georgia Tech. One thing I do think Georgia Tech is much better than UM is the weather. The extremely cold winter in Ann Arbor made me depressed much more easily than in Atlanta. \n\nThe other two biggest differences were: (1) I had a better advisor and (2) my research field was much more interesting here.\n\nThe qualifying exam was hard and very low passing rate in School of Aerospace Engineering. Once I passed it, I realized the more challenging thing was my own research. I had stuck in the same place for 4 months, which wasn\u2019t the worst for PhD students as I know.\n\nI was so stressed out and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder while preparing for my qualifying exam. I called school health center emergency line for help in an evening. I felt hopeless and thought about ending my life for a second. I was glad that I made that call.\n\nThe mental health and support system in Georgia Tech may not be the best in this country. But it\u2019s not that bad. As I know, the school tried to improve the mental health support system every year.\n\nIf you feel you need help, please go ask for help. We are human beings. We are not unbeatable. As long as you want, there are people out there offering support.\n\nI don\u2019t know what you are being through right now. But please don\u2019t give up.",

It's just a symptom of my social anxiety.\n\nI never get tremors at work though because I usually work with old guys and I don't want to befriend them the way I wanted to with my peers and professors at school. I never had that tremor issue before until I got into engineering, because I feel like there's so much pressure to know what you're talking about.

The physical effects though are very very infrequent and that's because I don't overwork myself anymore. When I was going through my master's and working, the stress was a lot to deal with. I also didn't have a support system in Georgia, I moved here for school and was immediately busy. The people I met at work for the most part did not share my ideals and I didn't feel like I could be more than coworkers with them as a result.\n\nToday I still work there but the group of people I directly work with has changed, they are more similar to me in terms of ideals and interests and are much kinder.\n\nBeing around people who you can be yourself around is very therapeutic.\n\nNot overworking yourself allows you to take time for self care so that you don't have all that stress build up.\n\nAnd then also, I worked projects as a technical lead, which forced me to be more assertive and challenge myself. This allowed me to build my self esteem and see that I was as capable of succeeding as my peers were. I had two problem team members who were very aggressive, one would yell and cuss me out. and after trying to deal with it on my own for a very long time I finally broke down and cried, wrote an email to my supervisor about what I was experiencing and said I would continue working as the lead but only talk to the guy who was giving me trouble in writing. My supervisor was very supportive. Knowing that I had people at work who would help me handle more hostile employees was a relief. I had come into that job thinking that I would be othered by most of my peers as a woman of color and just have to deal with it. But my supervisor was really cool and eventually I made it into a team of developers who are more professional and kind.\n\nSo my advice is, be kind to yourself and take care of your mental/emotional/physical health, distance yourself from toxicity whenever possible, find people you can trust and talk to them, and don't be afraid to speak your mind because nobody knows everything all the time.\n\nIf I could do the masters at tech again I still would. It was painful but paid off eventually. And now that I am past it I intend to do more to enjoy life instead of working all the time.",

Its a good location though, I would recommend getting a room in SHELL, not Nelson. Shell seems to be in much better condition overall, but is slightly further from laundry. Not that it matters, you need to exit the building for about 30ft to do laundry regardless of where you live.",

However, due to the recent ban on CS transfer, my only option would be to transfer into CompE. \n\nIn terms of my interests, I am honestly open and flexible for both fields (as I don't know enough about the distinction yet except that it's mainly hardware vs. software) but know I don't want to work in robotics or the electrical side of things in CompE.\n\nI am pretty lost and confused about if I should just pursue CS at my state college or transfer into the CompE program at GT. Was also wondering how the job market outlook would be for CompE compared to CS and how the CompE threads of cybersecurity and distributed system &amp; software design or Cybersec. &amp; Systems and architecture would fair up to the industry?  \n\n\nthanks!",

MFCC costs $5 per session without insurance, but the drawback is you're scheduled with their grad students who are doing a 1-year clinical evaluation with you and all their other patients. You don't get an ACTUAL therapist. I got to MFCC. My first therapist was great, my second I've struggled with but I'm finally learning some stuff from. \n\ngood luck w whatever you do",

Best of all, back then at least they didn't really care if you paid or not, it's not like they'll send you to collections or hunt you down or anything, so if you're really low on money it's nice.",

            "title": "A Definitive Guide For Prospective Transfer Students On Pathways Looking Into Tech",
            "selftext": "Hello!\n\nMy name is Alex, and I\u2019m a transfer student from Clayton State University into Georgia Tech for Computer Engineering! I transferred in on the conditional pathway during Summer 2023, and wanted to help other prospective students by making a guide on how to navigate the transfer system at Tech!\n\n***I want to go ahead and preface this by saying that there will be alot to read***, and Tech's requirements may change as time moves on - so some of this information may be little out of date. Therefore please double check any questions you may have with either the admissions website or a quick email/phone call to an admissions officer! ***I'm also not involved any way with the admissions office whatsoever***, and this is just an accumulation of information I've gathered over two years of trying (and succeeding) to get into Tech!\n\n&gt;**If you spot any errors (and can provide links to sources) in this article - please don't hesitate to point them out and I'll gladly give you credit!** Typos or bad advice included! My goal is to make this a one stop shop for prospective students to read after getting in, and that starts with a community effort of making this better!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Also, please don't hesitate to ask questions in the comments that you feel I didn't answer here** \\- I'll gladly try my best to respond, and even add them to the FAQ's section once I get a solid and verifiable answer!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What do I do now?\n\nAs I mentioned previously, I was accepted into Tech under the Conditional Pathway from Clayton State. However, my transition into college was not nearly as easy as it should have been. For a lot of y\u2019all, the next steps will be to find a suitable school to get your credits and transfer from!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background (Feel free to skip to the next bolded title!)**\n\nBelieve it or not, this was single handedly my biggest issue heading into life as a college student. This was due to everyone\u2019s nemesis in highschool - standardized testing. On a cold Monday morning in early February 2022, I awoke to a dreadful email from the ACT stating that my test that I had taken almost 2 months previously had fallen off a delivery truck and was lost. They provided me with a template to send to schools on my behalf apologizing for their oversight - as if anyone would believe an email from a student\u2019s email address. And gave me a free test retake, which was already 1 month overdue for Tech and another school I had applied to on the West Coast. What this also did was quite literally screw me for financial aid in Georgia, since the Zell-Miller scholarship required an ACT score of 26 or better. Leaving me with months of hard work and studying down the drain since the deadline to apply was already over with the ACT\u2019s next grading window. But it wasn\u2019t just me affected by this negligence, hundreds of other students had their scores lost too - [and I was even interviewed on the local news](https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/henry-county-teen-says-he-never-received-college-admission-test-scores)!\n\nThis left me practically paralyzed, as I had no way of proving to colleges in my area that I could handle a college workload at a level tech would take in time for me to transfer.\n\nI\u2019m not telling you this sob story to scare you, I\u2019m telling it as a story of compassion and warning - since looking back there were so many things I wish I would have known before I started college!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Before I apply to other schools, what should I know?**\n\nFirstly, unless you have an older brother/sister or close cousin that can help you out with the admissions process - you\u2019re going to be on your own here. And while it may sound super scary - especially coming from highschool where your advisor likely picked the classes you took and made your schedule - I\u2019m here to let you know that I\u2019ll do my best to help get you started!\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already done it, [your first and foremost thing you\u2019ll need to do is get the FAFSA done!](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) You should have already been prompted to do this when you applied to Tech, but if not - get this done ASAP!\n\n* ***For Georgia Residents***\n\nIf you\u2019re a Georgia resident, go ahead and count your lucky stars! As you\u2019re in a minority of Tech\u2019s applicants, and now get to experience all my tips and tricks!\n\nFirstly, [do not enroll at a TCSG school!](https://www.tcsg.edu/find-a-college/) In the state of Georgia, these are state owned and operated trade schools (like for welding or cooking) - not community colleges where you can go and get credits on the cheap! You will have advisors lie to you about the transferability of credits, as it happened to me. The TCSG is a different educational branch from the USG (the one that oversees Georgia Tech). You\u2019ll need to be looking into enrolling at a USG school - ***if you\u2019ve already signed up for schools like Kennesaw State, u\\[sic\\]GA, GSU,*** [***or any one of these schools listed here***](https://www.usg.edu/institutions/) ***- you\u2019re okay and can skip the next paragraph!***\n\nIf you did enroll in a TCSG school, [you need to visit this page and cross reference the transferability of credits](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_location). You\u2019re in a really tight place here since you might not be able to take all your credits at a TCSG school - since from my understanding, you\u2019ll likely only be able to take classes GT considers remedial (like college algebra, precalculus or Algebra based Physics). I\u2019d highly recommend you figure out an exit strategy to a USG school, since GT is incredibly picky about the classes they\u2019ll take and the admissions department is really unforgiving about these requirements. For example, taking precalculus (because that's all they offer) and hoping that Tech will take it over Calc 1, will not work and will get you rejected! Your only other option is trying to cross enroll at a USG school to get those credits, but this process is incredibly messy and convoluted.\n\n***Tips and Tricks for Instate Students***\n\n*I\u2019d highly encourage you to not go to a bigger USG school - like KSU, u\\[sic\\]GA, or both GSU\u2019s.* This is because, while the transfer pathway from those schools to tech is more established; [if you miss your pathway and want/need to REPP transfer into Tech](https://www.usg.edu/committees/view/regents_engineering_pathways), your chances of getting in from those schools will be lower since there are more people fighting you for your stop. Consider smaller USG schools, especially those at the \u201cState University\u201d level. I\u2019d recommend staying away from \u201cState Colleges\u201d since those schools typically don\u2019t offer all the classes you need every semester. [But it\u2019s okay since schools at this level participate in a system called eCore!](https://ecore.usg.edu/courses/course-descriptions/) These are entirely online classes, that are often taught by professors at other USG schools - these courses are incredibly cheap and easy to pass! During my time at Clayton State, I took 3 eCore classes and loved it! I\u2019d highly recommend eCore for students still needing credits for English, or Physics 1 during the spring semester.\n\nLastly, [get in touch with your REPP advisor!](https://www.usg.edu/committees/view/regents_engineering_pathways) These are people who are here to help you - and despite not being pathway advisors, still know the transfer system inside and out! *(Shout out to Dr. Catherine Matos of Clayton State! She was my REPP advisor and is literally the only reason I\u2019m at Tech thanks to her awesome advising coming out of the ACT fiasco I mentioned earlier! For anyone in the south Atlanta area and looking for colleges to start at, I\u2019d highly recommend Clayton State University - and getting in touch with Dr. Matos ASAP! She will be a fantastic way to guarantee your success in college! She\u2019s seriously one of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met in college, and would give you the shirt off her back if it means she can help you.)* These are seasoned advisors who know the classes you need to take, have back channels to Tech\u2019s admissions department to ask questions, and can help get you in touch with other students also looking to transfer! Network and enjoy your time at this school! Take a part-time job, learn good study habits, and even TA for classes you enjoy if time allows! Remember this time is not about getting to Tech, but preparing for Tech - that\u2019s why their requirements are so high.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* ***For Out-of-state Residents / Internationals***\n\nYou need to check out OSCAR\u2019s transfer portal, [if your school is accredited by the SACSCOC](https://sacscoc.org/) \\- most of your 1000/2000 level classes should transfer into Tech. But if not, you\u2019ll need to check each semester before you register for classes to see what Tech tells you to take. Please note that if you\u2019re enrolled at a community college in a state far away like Arizona or California - and can\u2019t find a simple gen-ed to fulfill a non-essential class requirement like English. Get in contact with the admissions department ASAP as they\u2019ll likely be able to give you written feedback that they\u2019ll accept an otherwise non-acceptable class as fulfilling!\n\nIf you can\u2019t find a necessary class like Calculus 2 that will transfer to Tech, you need to contact the admissions department right away to get that squared away ASAP. Remember, when in doubt - always contact Tech\u2019s admissions department! (Phone calls are usually the fastest way when it comes to communicating with them, but emails allow you to get a paper trail).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* ***For Everyone***\n\n***Pathways are not Holistic,*** ***and admissions only cares about three things - the classes you\u2019ve taken, the credits you have, and your GPA.*** Notice that I separated \u201cthe classes you\u2019ve taken\u201d, and \u201cthe credits you have\u201d. This is because Tech also requires that you apply for entry into your sophomore year or later, so they require that you take at least 30 credits after highschool graduation. AP or CLEP credits do not fulfill this requirement - and Tech will know if you try to pass them off as classes you\u2019ve taken at your transfer school! This leads me to the next category, \u201cthe credits you have\u201d - while yes, Tech does want to see 30 post-high school credits, you can totally use credits from your AP tests as credit for classes, you just need to do it wisely and make sure that you don\u2019t run out of transferable classes! For example, if you took AP Calc and got credit (even if it's a 3) as long as your transfer school will take it - feel free to use it and skip calc 1 or 2! You\u2019ll just need to make sure that any classes you do take will transfer to Tech, and can be used to fulfill those 8-9 credit hour gaps that skipping a math sequence gives you. [Tech wants to also see 30 transferable credits, this is separate from the 30 post-high school requirement!](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/conditional-pathway) (I used a link for the Conditional pathway, but it's the same requirement for all pathways) This means if your AP credits transfer, or you can CLEP a class for credit, you should be able to fulfill this requirement easily - as long as you\u2019ve taken 30+ credits post highschool.\n\nLastly is your GPA, Tech needs a minimum of a 3.3 STEM GPA, and a minimum of a 3.3 overall GPA. This means you cannot expect to make a C in both Calculus I/II, and pad your GPA with easy arts classes. For in state students - if you're interested in knowing what classes count as a STEM GPA, try to find somewhere in your university where it list\u2019s HOPE (or USG) STEM GPA. These are typically counted by Tech as STEM classes for the purposes of GPA calculations. [You may also be able to check out this directory to find more classes at your school Tech considered STEM](https://apps.gsfc.org/securenextgen/dsp_stem_course_listings.cfm).\n\nThis pretty much covers the basics - I\u2019d also recommend you go ahead and make sure you know what classes you\u2019ll be taking in the fall. Have this in writing, as most universities love setting prerequisites high to milk more money from you for classes you don\u2019t need. So just because you took Calculus in highschool, doesn\u2019t mean your advisor will want/let you take calculus in the fall. If this is the case with you - you need to try to find a way to talk to someone and get them to perform a \u201cfaculty prerequisite override\u201d. Use those words exactly, and explain your situation with your pathway and time restraint. Otherwise, you might need to take a precalculus class over the summer like I did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Should I even bother transferring to Tech?\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a pathway - congratulations! Tech sees you as an accomplished student, and just needs some more time to make room for you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **For Instate students**\n\nYou probably know Atlanta, consider yourself lucky as there are people who come here from the other side of the planet. [I'd highly recommend that you take a self guided tour if time allows](https://application.gatech.edu/register/selfguidedtour)! I'm going to keep this section light on purpose as you likely know Atlanta, or have family that knows Atlanta. Tech is in a bubble in midtown, and is usually very safe compared to the rest of the city.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **For out of state students**\n\nAtlanta is a wonderful city! Full of amazing people - you're probably now getting a little worried about the possible move to Georgia - and that's okay! I\u2019m here to help ease some of these concerns you may have.\n\nFirstly, let's address the elephant in the room and talk about student well being - and possible issues with racism being in the South. Georgia is a much different place than it was in your history books. Georgia is a purple state now, filled with a lot more different views and opinions - and alot closer to Florida\u2019s political landscape in the late 1990\u2019s to early 2000\u2019s (mostly progressive socially, but fairly conservative fiscally). Let me go ahead and state that Georgia Tech is an incredibly diverse school, and is typically always well above the pack when it comes to making ground breaking and influential decisions. *For example, Tech was the first school in the South to desegregate - peacefully, and without court order in 1961.* There was not even so much as a recorded \u2018peaceful\u2019 protest during this period against desegregation. The three brave men who first enrolled at our campus have a statue on campus, and mind you this all went down before Alabama\u2019s Governor George Wallace gave his famous \u201csegregation now, segregation forever\u201d speech in 1963. Ivan Allan, who the College of Liberal Arts is named after, is an Alum of Tech and was famous for stating as Atlanta Mayor that Atlanta was \u201cA City Too Busy To Hate\u201d.\n\nAtlanta was also the birthplace of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, and the civil rights movement. With that being said - I won't pretend that racism doesn\u2019t happen on campus, but when it does happen it\u2019s no more common than a normal college campus. I personally don't feel too entitled to speak on this topic, but I'd recommend you reach out to some student organizations on campus to get their opinion on things - [here's a link to the directory](https://gatech.campuslabs.com/engage/organizations)!\n\nLet's talk about Georgia\u2019s climate and some things you need to know about living in Atlanta. Firstly, Georgia\u2019s climate tracks closer to a swamp than a normal city. So expect a lot of humid and muggy days - for those of you coming in from China, I\u2019ve heard some of my international friends say that Atlanta\u2019s climate is basically that of Chongqing to give some point of reference.\n\nWhen discussing Georgia\u2019s climate, remember this phrase I heard from my grandmother - \u201cThere are two seasons in Georgia, summer - and christmas\u201d. Expect cost of living to be higher than a college town but lower than a city like New York, Philadelphia, Boston, or San Francisco. Many students out of state students decide to go greek (rush a fraternity or sorority) due to the fact that it gives them more sense of home while studying at Georgia Tech - and also provides better food and (typically) better housing for less money.\n\nIf you expect to come into Tech and not need a car, please be aware that Atlanta is a very spread out city. So if you plan on getting outside of the city (or as locals call it - going OTP, outside the perimeter), expect needing a car. MARTA, Atlanta\u2019s public transit system - is very underfunded and is incredibly limited in its outreach. One of the few places it can go from campus however, is the airport - but this is the last stop on the Red line and it stays at ITP (Inside the perimeter).\n\nIf you do decide to bring a car, please be aware that parking passes are currently about $800 a year - so I\u2019d recommend visiting campus and seeing if you actually need one before committing. There is a Publix (a Southern chain of large grocery stores) across campus in midtown, so groceries will likely be a nonissue - especially if you plan on getting a meal plan while here.\n\nAlso, note that in the state of Georgia we offer tools for car owners that you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find elsewhere. The HERO/CHAMP programs - these are emergency response vehicles provided to you by the state free of charge for use. They are equipped with repair tools, patrol almost all parts of major highways in Georgia - and can easily be called through dialing 511 (the Georgia DoT\u2019s traffic reporting system) for help with anything from flat tires to accidents! (Fun fact, but they were created in 1994 for the Olympics - and were established in order to promote Southern Hospitality! These are men and women that work long, thankless, hours all to help us feel more safe on our roads.) You\u2019ll need to call HERO for most highways/interstates in Fulton county (the county containing Atlanta) - and CHAMP for highways outside of the metro area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What can I expect from Tech?\n\nFor most students, Tech functions just like a normal university. There are some of the brightest people here, and some people you'll have no idea what the admissions department was thinking.\n\nMost in-state students will also have been used to using D2L for their LMS (learning management system) at public colleges. However, Georgia Tech uses Canvas. Canvas is more user friendly, but also has features from lockdown browser built in - like off-tab detection, etc.\n\nTruthfully, I'm not sure what I can really put here besides what to look out for. Tech is a wonderful place, but it's what you make of it. There have been successful people that went to Tech, and successful people that didn't - I'd highly recommend that you not put so much pressure on yourself to get here. If you're happy at your previous school, that's great! You'll probably be happy here too, but there's no reason to force yourself to transfer if you feel that you won't be happy or won't take advantage of all the perks Tech has to offer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# FAQ's\n\nThe following are FAQ's that I've seen a number of times on the admissions megathreads. I'll try my best to answer them below and update them as time passes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;My class isn't offered at my college, [but is listed on the major transfer requirement sheet](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major) \\- can I still get in without it?\n\nProbably not, GT is very picky about the classes they'll take and what they won't. You should reach out to the admissions department first before asking online since admissions can bend rules or find equivalent classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Are out of state students able to earn the HOPE/Zell scholarship? And how do I obtain Georgia residence?\n\nOut of state students are unable to earn the HOPE/Zell scholarship, or any state funded scholarship. In order to obtain Georgia residency, [you need to meet the requirements listed here](https://catalog.gatech.edu/financial/tuition/out-of-state-tuition-waivers/). Be aware that attempting to lie about your residency is considered fraud! The easiest way to earn in state residency under the age of 26 is by having your parents move (or buy property) in Georgia in order to file taxes here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I'm an instate student at another University, and a required class I need to take to make my pathway isn't offered during my next semester - what do I do?\n\nFirstly, don't panic! You're probably okay - [get in touch with a REPP advisor at your college and ask them what they think your next steps are](https://www.usg.edu/committees/view/regents_engineering_pathways). For 80% of your required classes, [you can also take them online through eCore as well](https://ecore.usg.edu/courses/course-descriptions/)!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;How do I plan for the classes to take before getting to Tech?\n\nThe new way: (credit to u/lolxdxdjklol for both creating this tool and letting me know about it!) [use TransferToGATech](https://www.transfertogatech.com/). Just punch in your school and desired major, and the tool will find almost all the classes you need to take in order to transfer!\n\nThe old way: make a spreadsheet - [find your classes listed on the major required courses page](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major), [and then use the transfer credit equivalency tool](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_location) to find out what course numbers are listed as equivalent to Tech's courses. Here is an example of my spreadsheet from my time at Clayton State:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h43sjfmv18fc1.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab4ff0cf16d56b6d533bbc37a67802248fc65480\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;How can I contact the admissions department?\n\n[You can contact them by going here](https://admission.gatech.edu/contact) and choosing to either email or call them. Calling typically gives you same day answers, while emailing allows you to form a paper trail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Can I switch majors after coming to Tech as a transfer?\n\nYes! You may have seen something from GT about how transfer students can't change their major - however this is only for transfer students who've earned less than 30 credits at Tech. Unlike freshman entry students, transfer major's must earn the permission of their destination major. This can either be fairly easy for majors not in much demand (such as LMC, Public Policy, etc) - or very difficult and competitive (for CS, MechE, CompE, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I got an arts and sciences pathway for GT - can I switch my major after coming here for CS or engineering?\n\nNo, you won't be able to switch your major into any engineering or CS program once you accept your offer under arts and sciences. However, there is a loophole - Math majors at GT can double major in CS and gain automatic admission into the program. Math is covered by the arts and sciences pathway, so this may be the way to go if you're okay with taking a few more semesters to graduate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Are pathways guaranteed entry?\n\nEffectively yes, there is no reason you should pick a non-competitve major (like Public Policy or LMC) if you've got a pathway offer that covers your desired major. As long as you've meet the requirements I listed above, you'll earn a secured spot at Tech for your major.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Does my major at my old school affect my ability to transfer to Tech? As in, do I need to be a mechanical engineering major at my old school in order to apply to Tech as a Mechanical Engineer?\n\nNo, your major at your old school has no effect on your ability to transfer to Tech. You could, in theory apply to Tech as an English major and be granted entry for Electrical Engineering as long as you meet the prerequisites listed above.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note though that not all majors are created equally, and it\u2019s important to pick a major at your university that allows you to complete all prerequisites in a timely fashion. *Instate students on Zell-Miller or HOPE should enroll in a major that requires the classes Tech does to transfer, as those scholarships do not pay for non-required non-major classes.*\n\nWhen picking a major to transfer from, I'd recommend you choose something similar to the field you want to apply to Tech as. For example, choose biology if you want to transfer into Biomolecular engineering - or computer science for Electrical/Computer engineering. Math and Physics degrees also work if your university offers them, as they'll allow you to enroll in all the same Gen-Ed's GT requires.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;I\u2019m on REPP, does community involvement (such as clubs, community service, etc) affect my transfer application?\n\nYes! When you apply on REPP, you\u2019re effectively placing yourself in a smaller pool of applicants - all competing for spots at Tech through a holistic review process. This means that things like community service, awards, and work experience will all make an impact on your likelihood of being accepted! From conversations with some admissions officers I've had at Tech however, work experience (this includes volunteer work) single handedly has the biggest impact on this category.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Help! Nobody is responding to me on the subreddit's megathreads! I'm not sure what to do as I have a specific question or need advice!\n\nDon't worry! I'd recommend you [reach out to the GT discord](https://discord.com/invite/gt), or call (not email) the admissions office as you should be able to get incontact with an admissions officer that same day via phone!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;My class isn't listed on the GT transfer table (or is listed as \"Departmental Review Required\"), what should I do?\n\nFirstly, please note that the table is not a definitive be all end all guide - all classes listed on your transcript are required to be reviewed by the registrar. As a result, save all of your syllabi! When the table lists \"Departmental review required\" - this just means the registrar hasn't seen this class before and needs to know what was taught and how it should evaluate it as. If the class you're taking isn't listed - that just means they haven't had a chance to update their internal database of classes yet.\n\nIf the class you need is required, or you're just concerned as it's not listed on the registrar's website - go ahead and contact admissions and see what they can say! When I was transferring into Tech (this policy may have changed), you should be able to start the review process early by contacting the admissions department before you submit your application!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

CS can only go into software, whereas it's very unlikely for a EE to get a software job.\n\nHope this helps! Please feel free to DM me with any more questions!",

Firstly, it\u2019s 100% worth it to move back to Georgia as your son would be eligible for the HOPE/Zell Miller scholarship and would have a significant chunk of his tuition taken care of! My friend is from New York, graduated in New York, but moved here while going to\nClayton State with me and earned the HOPE scholarship since they just need a high school transcript that\u2019s accredited.\n\nTo answer your question, [as per the out of state tuition waiver home page](https://catalog.gatech.edu/financial/tuition/out-of-state-tuition-waivers/):\n&gt; As of the first day of classes for the term, an economic advantage waiver may be granted to a U.S. citizen or U.S. legal permanent resident who is a dependent or independent student and can provide clear evidence that the student or the student's parent, spouse, or U.S. court-appointed legal guardian has relocated to the State of Georgia to accept full-time, self-sustaining employment and has established domicile in the State of Georgia. Relocation to the state must be for reasons other than enrolling in an institution of higher education. For U.S. citizens or U.S. legal permanent residents, this waiver will expire 12 months from the date the waiver was granted.\n\nIn other words, you\u2019ll need to establish residency in Georgia before the first day of your son\u2019s first semester. But you could always move down here over the summer, have him take 3 credits over the summer as an out of state student, and go back in the fall as a Georgia resident!\n\nHope this helps!

But yes you\u2019re correct, the biggest issue he\u2019ll have is finding classes at that point that are able to transfer. It\u2019s GT policy that the last 36 credits of a major have to be taken at GT, as a result they typically won\u2019t bother reviewing most 3000/4000 level courses. Meaning your son might need to retake classes in order to fit in the 30 credit requirement.\n\n[For a clear cut answer on what will transfer and what won\u2019t, check out the transfer equivalency table.](https://oscar.gatech.edu/pls/bprod/wwsktrna.P_find_location)\n\nAlso, before I forget - make sure you have him save all former syllabi as he\u2019ll probably need them in order to have the registrar/department review credit! In the state of Georgia, all colleges must allow you to challenge registrar\u2019s not giving credit for classes - as a result, once he gets here he might be able to save a few semesters just by providing syllabi!",

Glad to hear that I could help!\n\nThe table is not a definitive be all end all guide - all classes listed on your transcript are required to be reviewed by the registrar. As a result, save all of your syllabi! When the table lists \"Departmental review required\" - this just means the registrar hasn't seen this class before and needs to know what was taught and how it should evaluate it as. Or in your case, if it's not listed - that just means they haven't had a chance to update their internal database of classes yet.\n\nIf the class you need is required, or you're just concerned as it's not listed on the registrar's website - go ahead and contact admissions and see what they can say! When I was transferring into Tech (this policy may have changed), you should be able to start the review process early by contacting the admissions department before you submit your application!\n\nHope this helps!

                    "body": "u/rockenman1234 \\- Great post!  Lots of great info here.  I do have a question about AP credits, though.  My son (a current hs senior) recently received a conditional transfer pathway offer to GT for Summer 2025.  He's planning to attend Kennesaw State University in the fall of this year.  That said, he will likely have some AP credits going into KSU from high school classes/AP exam scores.  My question is, if KSU gives him credit for an AP class, and the KSU course equivalent meets one of the course requirements for his conditional transfer, can those KSU course credits (awarded on the basis of AP exam results) be used to meet course requirements for the conditional transfer to GT?   For example, he's taking AP Physics C this year.  Let's say he takes the AP exam and makes a 4 and KSU gives him credit for PHYS 2211.   Let's also say KSU's PHYS 2211 maps to GT's PHYS 2211 in the equivalency table.  If he's conditionally transferring into a major that requires PHYS 2211 as a requirement for the conditional transfer, does the credit from KSU (which originated from an AP exam credit) count?   I ask because KSU may have lighter rules on what they'll accept for AP credits than GT... but once the AP credit becomes an actual course equivalent on his KS transcript - I would guess that GT is no longer evaluating that credit like an AP credit and is simply evaluating it against the course equivalency chart between KSU and GT.   This probably sounds like a pretty convoluted question... but I think my son has at least a couple of AP classes like this.   Thoughts???  (p.s. I know the AP credits don't count toward the 30 hour requirement of post -high school college coursework - I'm asking specifically about the specific courses required by major to transfer  - see  [Transfer Course Requirements | Undergraduate Admission (gatech.edu)](https://admission.gatech.edu/transfer/course-requirements-major) ).  Thanks !!!",

And congratulations to your son for getting a pathway - it\u2019s a huge achievement and I hope he\u2019s able to take advantage of it!\n\nTo answer your question, yes - you\u2019ll be able to use AP credit towards major specific admissions requirements! And as a bonus, if KSU gives him credit for 3\u2019s then GT will honor that as well! That\u2019s how I was able to get out of taking English 1101 at Clayton State, while also being able to transfer to Tech the next semester! I believe I made a 3 on the exam (which GT doesn\u2019t accept) but Clayton took it and gave me credit. As a result I could use the credit for ENGL1101 towards my transfer application. GT will also always award credit for sequence classes, so if he takes Physics 2 at KSU they won\u2019t pull his credit for PHYS2211 if they find out he didn\u2019t qualify for AP credit at Tech (which has never happened before).\n\nMy only word of advice is to be aware of the credit requirements for transfer applicants! If he gets a ton of AP credit, then there is a chance that he might no be able to take enough transferable classes post high school in order to qualify for the pathway! Look into other math classes, like linear algebra or discrete math (if required) to fill in that gap made by physics! He should reach out to KSU\u2019s REPP advisor and see what they recommend as well based on course load and credit obtained.\n\nBest of luck with admissions - and congratulations again to your son! Please let me know if you\u2019ve got any more questions!",

It might not be the best, but you'll get something. After that, it's every man for himself and housing will probably not be guaranteed. This isn't always the case - but is what I've seen 90% of the the time.\n\nI got threatened with woodruff too lol - and ended up having my pick of the Nav's when the selection window opened. If you get put on the waitlist, just wait and see what happens before you rush to sign with an off campus company - I know two people that got hit with a $500 late fee because they applied, got waitlisted, signed off campus but didn't pull their application, and when they got off the waitlist during the assignment window and could pick a dorm were stuck paying a $500 cancelation fee.",

If so, transferring from an out of state school into Tech will be difficult but not impossible. From what I\u2019ve heard, GT admissions like forcing people to jump through hoops before they can get in - for example, they typically like seeing people without pathways apply 2-3 times before they accept them.\n\nMy best words of advice would be to [get in touch with someone on the GT discord](https://discord.com/invite/GT) to see what they did - and find a school nearby that has all the classes you need to graduate, along with a backup plan if something goes wrong or you\u2019re not able to get in.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry but that\u2019s pretty much the extent of my knowledge - best of luck!

With that being said it\u2019s significantly easier to transfer into Tech from another Georgia college as a Georgia resident than out of state! Once you get all the required classes done for your GT major and reach 30 credits, you should be able to start doing transfer applications.\n\n[It looks like you\u2019re going to want to contact Sahithya Reddivari at GSU perimeter to start getting more info about REPP](https://www.usg.edu/committees/view/regents_engineering_pathways).",

If the Ap credits themselves fill a requirement for GT transfer, like AP Lang working for ENGL1101, but for the school i\u2019m going to before GT, the credits go towards a class that is not yet approved to fill the requirement ENGL1101, what does that mean? Because i\u2019m technically not taking, for example ENGLIT 0000. But, that\u2019s where my ap credits go to before going to GT. Can I just ignore it and simply have the ap courses themselves on my  transfer application to fill that course requirement? On the other hand, AP Calc AB works for a course that gets me 4 credits transferred to GT, but if AP Calc were to be straight transferred to GT, it would just be two. But both fill the requirement of Math 1551. How many math credits do I have then?",

There are a lot more RSOs at UIUC and most graduates come out of UIUC with jobs in the Midwest and California. Champaign is nice but UIUC\u2019s location is rather isolating and there isn\u2019t much outside of college life that\u2019s going on. Want to see a concert? Got to drive 2.5 hours to Chicago for that.  GT is located in a city, and has a lot of connections within the Southeast. A lot of employers have headquarters around you which is a benefit. Not a whole lot of bars that are geared toward college students. Much more going on. There is easy airport access which is wonderful. At UIUC you got to pay 40 bucks for a 3 hour bus ride to get to O\u2019Hare in Chicago. \n\nAll that being said, both programs are really prestigious and ranked around the same. It all depends on whether you prefer city life or traditional college town life surrounded by corn fields.",

Beautiful courtyard, nice view of the pencil building, good location imo, larger kitchen than most on campus apartments, etc. but recently it has really gone down hill. \n\nThe elevators have been having constant issues. At least one is out of order at any given time. I noticed they haven\u2019t actually been inspected since 2022, which I suspect has something to do with that.\n\nThey installed new AED boxes all over the place with warnings saying they don\u2019t actually contain an AED, and they\u2019re \u201cworking on it.\u201d However, they\u2019ve been empty as long as I\u2019ve been here (~6 months) and probably longer. Hopefully this isn\u2019t a pressing issue and no one is going to be in need of one, but it just seems lazy and mildly unsafe to install the boxes with nothing in them and no sign of fixing it anytime soon. \n\nThere have always been issues with frequent fire alarms (I remember having the same problem when I lived here in 2020-21). But it has gotten much worse. We\u2019ve had 4 fire alarms in the last 2 days. 1 a.m., 5 a.m., 7 a.m. yesterday, and 9 a.m. today. Not only is this wildly inconvenient and annoying, it\u2019s unsafe. Very much a boy who cried wolf situation. The housing office sent out a message reminding us that we have to evacuate each time, and ensuring us that they are trying to fix the root cause. I find this hard to believe since there have been multiple similar instances over several years and no sign of progress. \n\nThe latest issue that\u2019s been bothering me is the intense construction. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a result of flooding due to the sudden cold snap we had a previous week. I understand that this probably wasn\u2019t planned, and that they have to do it. However, it smells dangerously awful and people are still living in this construction zone. Like, give you a headache make you nauseous type awful. We received no warning, no alternative accommodations or compensation. The walls are missing and the hallways is full of fumes. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s still livable but it\u2019s just a bit frustrating and almost comical atp how much gt Housing can slack off. \n\nTLDR: quality of life has plummeted @ NAN. Just wanted to blow off some steam abt the situation &amp; make people aware as they are deciding where to live.",

Instead of focusing on \"get a girlfriend,\" focus on finding something you enjoy doing. I don't know what clubs are at Tech these days but there must be lots of them: outdoors, gaming, music, theater. And of course, campus publications worked for me! As long as it's a group that includes girls, you have a good chance of finding a friend. Good luck.",

The National Lab expressed interest in putting me through a program where they pay for my MS in CS, and they said the BS/MS is a good program for that, as it only takes a year.\n\nNaturally, I was excited. I also saw that GT was the most common school for students in that program.\n\nI talked to my academic advisor about this program and was surprised by her answer:\n\nI was told that it was \"unlikely\" that I would be accepted and that my 3.7 GPA was \"low\".  \nWhen I asked for further comment, she told me that they \"only want top students\".\n\nI asked her if she could get more information, or if there were any people I could reach out to. I reinstated the importance of this for my long term career goals. I was told that I should not reach out to anyone involved in the BS/MS program, because they \"will only talk to students that have been admitted already\" - she mentioned that she couldn't tell me anything more because she could \"get terminated\".\n\nI am at a bit of a loss, I thought the requirement was a 3.4. I am also taken aback by the lack of transparency.\n\nI had been counting on getting into the BS/MS programming given my professional goals and for my future with the National Lab.\n\nI need to make an assessment about whether I have a realistic chance of being admitted into the BS/MS program or if I should focus on applying to other schools and could seriously use some advice about who I can reach out to, so I thought I'd post this.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I also had what I believe was a strong recommendation from a CoC faculty member. \n\nYou would miss out on being able to double count two classes, therefore having to take maybe an extra semester.

I'm wondering why we're having a game all the way in Ireland, mainly because:\n\n1) Football is virtually non-existent outside of the US, so I'm surprised we're playing at a non-US venue. Idk something about a hoard of Americans going abroad to watch an American sport that the locals most likely know nothing about and do not engage in feels off to me.\n\n2) The game is on August 24, which I assumed is the weekend after classes start. So is the school expecting a lot of students to travel to Ireland and back all in the span of one weekend?\n\n3) Building off of point 2, I checked flight prices and saw they're around $1300 for a roundtrip (I used August 22 to 25). So is the school expecting students to somehow come up with that kind of money (considering that's up to the equivalent of 1 month's rent for most people) \\[P.S. I know GT can't do anything about flight prices, I just find it interesting that they think we'll pay so much just for a game that will most likely televised)",

There will be about 630 high school students from 42 schools competing that day. If you were involved with Science Olympiad in high school and would like to meet with other SciOly alumni, or if you would just like to come hang out, please consider joining us on tournament day. You do not need to have been involved in Science Olympiad in middle or high school to volunteer.\n\nCurrently we are **a bit short-staffed** in terms of volunteers for the tournament, and due to that we have come back to the subreddit to ask fellow Jackets to help us out and volunteer.\n\nIn particular, we are looking for general volunteers to support event supervisors. General volunteers can volunteer for any amount of hours on tournament day, and most events are held in or around the CULC. If you are interested in being a general volunteer, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwDl2peNj8t3DZEaZh8bkGEmBVjCgOEJyPGc8Z12o_DYlkBg/viewform). It truly is a rewarding and fun experience where you can meet new people, and help the next generation gain a love of STEM.\n\nPizza (around noon), t-shirts, and snacks all day will be provided to all volunteers.\n\nIf you have any questions, please let us know at [scioly.gatech@gmail.com](mailto:scioly.gatech@gmail.com). Thanks for your support!",

            "selftext": "My roommate is in his capstone class and had proposed his own project. He was the first to propose a project actually. He wanted to build a mask similar to that of Rorschach, a character from Watchmen. Essentially, it is a pattern changing mask that responds to temperature changes like when talking. It would simulate ink blot patterns and could be applied to other clothing articles as well. This technology surprisingly doesn't exist in the degree he wished to pursue, only being emulated used panels and rigid circuits.\n\nHe proposed this project to his professor at the start of the semester, and was accepted.\nHe presented his idea to the class, and again his semester, and was accepted and acquired teammates. (He named his team Rorschack)\nHe bid on his own project with his team, and was again accepted.\n3 weeks later, today actually, He was told that his project specifically could not be allowed. And the only reason given was \"we can't have something for just fashion purposes\" despite making clear every single time that the only currently planned application was fashion. Now they decide he can't.\n\nSo now, he wasn't even given the option to pick a new project, he was handed some project that no other team wanted. This is absolutely outrageous and completely antithetical to the purpose of capstone design.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the way he was told was his professor made 2 of his team members flip on the idea while he was in training for one of the spaces. He wasn't even present for the discussion, he simply showed back up and was told.\n\nHe was immensely passionate about this project, and worked hard these past 3 weeks researching and even buying tools needed. Taking this from him purely because \"fashion is not an application\" is a disgrace, especially considering the uniqueness of his concept here. A concept which is very doable according to his research.\n\nI am seeking immediate reapproval for my roommate's project, as well as an apology for even suggesting that his idea wasn't \"impactful enough\".\n\nI have emailed Dr. Jariwala, the dean of students, and the dean of the college of engineering.\n\nThe fact he was only told now after 3 separate proposals in which it was accepted, is egregious and puts him at a huge disadvantage.\n\nIf you would like to help my roommate, please also email the Dean of Students and Dr. Jariwala asking for Project Rorschach to be reinstated, and saying that Dr. Wayne Lee's actions are completely antithetical to the purpose of capstone and the commencement speech of \"you can do it\".",

Even he said he wouldn't have a problem with that, since then at least he could choose a project he was also interested in.\n\nIn terms of application, we might be talking past each other. Because it just is fashion. He had talked to a company about if they would sell pattern changing clothes and they said yes. That's how he found out about the current tech they have for pattern changing, just rigid panels attached to fabric. But he did research and find more fashion based applications.\n\nIn therapeutic setting, the pattern changing can be soothing or be used for analysis, basically the same as like ink blot tests or like, ADHD focusers.\n\nIn terms of cosplay, sure maybe that's just a hobby, and that boils to \"looks cool\" but in that same vein it could have applications for movie use and cinematic uses, since it's far cheaper than the panel tech.\n\nIn terms of military use, it could potentially be developed as a form of camouflage, depending on the color combinations.\n\nThis still all fell under fashion though, so he kept saying fashion since that's what it was.",

The color change isn\u2019t going to be sensitive enough to tell you anything outside of binary contact/no contact info. Having methanol near the nose/eyes and touching skin (even if it\u2019s enclosed) is also not a great idea. \n\n2. Your friend\u2019s progress in coming up with a proper bid is not great. It took me less than a minute to google color changing mask and find a paper talking about special TEAL respirators with thermosensors to help with proper fitting. He could have done this day 1, saw this product, ID\u2019d the flaw (sensor is attached to respirator) and have his capstone project be: Development of a thermosenstive reporter to ensure proper fit of ANY respirator. Ta-dah. He gets his mask idea and it has a function outside of fashion. He could have even just had the proposed use as a stopgap bs thing just for the professor and change the application later. There is no good reason he and his entire team couldn\u2019t come up with a use in 3 weeks when I did with a single google search.",

That just really isn't who he is. He's extremely straightforward. He wouldn't do something like propose an application purely as a stopgap, even if it meant to work on his dream project.",

If you want to talk about perspective, how does it look on ME capstone management that a project that recieved approval 3 separate times is now deemed unworthy?\n\nIn my opinion, It shouldn't matter who the complaint comes from, as long as its voiced.

Something with no application other than fashion has no place in ME capstone\n\nThere is an expo at the end of the semester where projects are displayed for judges and the community to come see. I couldn't imagine someone coming up to my ME capstone project, asking what my project does, and saying \"Yeah it's a mask that looks like the one from the comics.\" I mean come on, have some common sense.",

Could you argue that it can go beyond fashion?",

I'm sure it has more defined uses then fashion, but since fashion was so broad, and because fashion designers would honestly buy this if given the chance considering it hasn't been explored that much yet, they decided to stick with it for now.\n\nThey were planning on researching other applications as well, since they could easily change the colors of the patterns (instead of white and black, a fee other combinations he said would work). I'm sure there could be medical uses with using the shifting patterns, or maybe even military uses.\n\nEssentially it's just that fashion was what they had defined so far and talked with a company about the applications. And again, he did specify this in his proposals too. I do understand the real world problem argument, but there are a decent chunk of capstone project ls where the problem is simply, \"it doesn't exist yet\"",

A mask like that should be relatively trivial to find a justification beyond \"we just want it to be fashionable\" if that is actually a project the team still wants to do. OP even mentioned a couple possible reasons in one of their comments. Now they ran off half cocked with what sounds like only part of the story, escalated a situation they weren't a part of above Wayne's head, have made a pretty serious accusation about Wayne's character here, and if other members of the team were concerned about the project it's all a moot point anyways.\n\nFrom what I knew dealing with him, I don't think Wayne would retaliate over it. He always struck me as very fair and even keeled. But he would absolutely be justified in being pissed, especially if this post somehow gets across his desk. And I know there used to be some professors who would pop in here when I was at Tech, so I have no doubt somebody involved with the faculty has come across this post",

Free food will be provided\n\nFor more of a background: the goal of SiliconJackets is to make the process of design and tapeout of silicon chips more accessible to students. We have three subteams students can join: \n\nDesign: complete the actual design of our chip using systemverilog\n\nVerification / Emulation: verify the functionality of our design using simulation and emulate the design in both software and in hardware on FPGAs\n\nPhysical Design: take our design from hardware description language to actual hardware setting physical constraints and running the software to generate our final transistor layout\n\nLooking forward to seeing some of you there!",

Their claims were good, such as 12,000 dollars for the summer, all majors accepted, and learning soft skills for the future.  A little research shows the company is incredibly sketchy, and some colleges have banned them.\n\nIs there any way to report them to CareerBuzz? Hopefully students research this company before they apply.",

Its fixed now tho. Thing about laundry is you have to go outside for it since there's only 1 entrance and it's an outdoor one. It's still in the nelson shell building but you'll have to step out for it. Plumbing and ac are pretty decent, the ac is controlled using a dial and there aren't any numbers on it. Common rooms are pretty spacious and actually pretty nice.\n\nI've never had noise issues from outside, but depending on the side of the building you live on, you might? Also the first floor single digit side (think 101-109, not sure about the exact numbers but just the rooms on that side) has mold growing on the ceilings in the hallway, or at least it used to last year.",

I've been feeling, as the semesters have gone on, more comfortable with SysArch vs Intel (this may be because I haven't finished an Intel class yet \\[currently taking CS 3600\\]). The only reason I chose Intel in the first place was because of all the hype surrounding it, but seeing as how if I really wanna do an AI-oriented job in the field, I need to get a Masters/PhD in it (I'm not against doing that, \\[in fact, I love research\\] but I'm not sure if I could make that time/money commitment on something I might not be interested in).\n\nThat brings me to consider fully switching majors into Computer Engineering. How is it different from CS? For those who've graduated with a CompE major, how's the job market compared to CS? Should I, instead of switching majors, switch threads by exchanging Intel with Modsim? How easy would it be to transfer from CS to CompE?",

You can then pick another CmpE thread, one of three CS threads (Devices, Info, SysArch), or one of three EE threads(sig proc, telecom, or robotics).\n\nYou will also have to add on ECE 2040 (Circuit Analysis).",

Even within compE it\u2019s a CS thread.\n\n\nMost other CompE classes have CS alternatives. \n\nThe only benefit from switching would be access to CHEA which would focus on the the physics behind the gate level abstractions through VLSI or the EE threads compE lets you take. \n\nIt\u2019s too much of a hassle switching if you aren\u2019t interested in those. Anything else and you can stay in CS. Would recommend looking at networking thread or even devices!",

Even if it's a few days late, as long as you get it done and submit proof along with the claim you'll get a dean of students verification and can forward it to your profs. GT doesn't want sick kids going around spreading germs lol - so I think they'll give 5 days off automatically, at least that's what I got last semester when I caught COVID.\n\nProfs aren't obligated to help, but almost all will lend a helping hand by extending due dates or giving you extra time to study for tests if you have one coming up. Your biggest issue will be catching up on missed material, that put me really far behind for the first test in Physics 2 last semester; and I really regret not doing more to make sure I had a good grasp on everything I missed.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nPS: Stamps should have free COVID testing covered through your tuition, I'd call them and check availability though!",

Yesterday however, it just started to refuse connecting to PS Network even though there were no issues on that side. So I wait till this morning to see if it improves and it doesn't. So following a recommendation I found elsewhere I disconnected from GTother and connected to my phones mobile hotspot and then it had no issues whatsoever. Reconnected to GTother and it proceeded to not work again. So has anyone had this issue before or currently having it? Did something GT did on their end screw something up?",

That team believed it was resolved yesterday afternoon, but this afternoon we got a couple of tickets from users on a small rural Georgia ISP that are still having trouble reaching GT resources. We don't have any other confirmed reports of connectivity problems related to this issue at the moment. \n\nYour PSN connectivity issues \\_could\\_ be related, though PSN is obviously not a small ISP. SoX staff going to do some maintenance at 7pm and they hope that addresses this issue. If you are still having problems after 7pm, please submit a ticket for   \nResidential Tech Support:   \n[https://wrecktechs.gatech.edu/](https://wrecktechs.gatech.edu/)  \nEveryone else:  \n[https://gatech.service-now.com/home](https://gatech.service-now.com/home)  \n\n\nThanks!",

Yeah the counters may look clean, but you just wiped stuff from the counter into the food. \n\nAlso the plates are usually dirty and I have to look through at least 5 plates to find one that\u2019s just acceptable. Why can\u2019t we just get paper plates?? My room mate wasn\u2019t paying attention last week and started drinking water from a \u201cclean\u201d cup with old rice inside it from someone else.\n\nAlso the workers like to spray chemicals to clean the tables right next to students eating which is a big no no. You spray the chemical and you get this cloud of bleach(or whatever chemical) in the air which could be getting on my food. I have had this a few times this semester alone. \n\nEven with all these problems, I wouldn\u2019t make a fuss about it if the plan was appropriately priced. I pay 2,850 a semester, $450 of it is dining dollars when you have the weekday plan.\n\n$2400 for 15 weeks, 5 days a week, is $32 a day. That is absolutely insane for the food options available and what I actually end up eating. \n\nFor $32 a day you can: \n\nEat 3 large panda meals.\n\nEat 2-3 twisted taco bowls.\n\nEat 5-6 deluxe chicken sandwiches at CFA.\n\nMake your own food and eat like a king. \n\n(note I probably wouldn\u2019t even eat as much as any one of the above plans in a day, which further adds to my point)",

To work late or early in January in the freezing cold takes a \\*heavy\\* toll on people, and quite frankly, the administrative and logistical support these folks recieve isn't great. \n\nImagine how much your day sucks when you don't get breakfast. Ok, now imagine you woke up much earlier, and had to shiver at a bus stop, and then walk in the frost, and then shiver, and so on, and then cook someone else's breakfast.\n\nI know we need food. This is a hard school. We all have hard work. However, that resentment you're feeling right now. Don't let it make you cruel to people. Smile at staff. Give them a thank you. As how you can help.

It was much worse in the previous years... they even served rancid ground turkey meat once. \n\nNow what I do agree on is that the price of the meal plan is too much especially for freshmen.

Many students in the regular application process coming from high school are offered summer admission rather than fall. They do this to stagger classes and accommodate as many new students as possible.\n\nSecond,  if you enroll here for summer, Tech doesn't allow you to be a transient student elsewhere while being enrolled at Tech, so you wouldn't technically be able to accept your offer of summer admission without enrolling for summer classes here. And if they do admit you for fall instead, you haven't officially matriculated into Tech so you wouldn't actually be considered a transient student in the summer at that other school.\n\nYou need to talk to your admissions rep to try to work this all out, but be prepared for a \"no\" or for mutually exclusive conditions for what you want to do. I'm sure you're not the first to ask this of Tech admissions.",

If that\u2019s not enough, go to Professor Leonard or Khan Academy or 3Blue1Brown etc. But you always have to come back to doing exercises because math is not a spectator\u2019s sport.

I saw in another comment that you plan on taking it because you forgot a lot of the content, but I would think about whether or not you care more about being good at hand computation of linear algebra problems, or if you care about rigor and learning the content to a higher degree of understanding.\n\nIf you are looking for the latter, I would strongly suggest you take MATH 3406 (A Second Course in Linear Algebra) instead. This is more of an abstract linear algebra course that is proof based rather than computation based, and you'll come out with a much better understanding of linear algebra from an abstract algebra perspective. Instead of just talking about numerical problems and performing operations by hand, you will build up a fundamental understanding of each aspect of linear algebra, starting from defining vector spaces and ending with theoretically useful tools such as Jordan Normal Form and SVD. This type of class can be helpful if you decide to take higher level mathematics courses later down the road.\n\nThat said, please note I have zero idea what quant preparation is supposed to look like. It is entirely possible that proof-based mathematics won't be helpful for you, in which case 3406 may not be worthwhile.",

However, I just realized the only options listened for graduate housing are the tenth &amp; home buildings. Ironically, the graduate living center isn\u2019t even included as an option. Is that really the only option? The location of 10th &amp; home is not ideal, seems to be the most expensive on campus housing, and there\u2019s no furniture. \n\nDo I need to figure out an off campus living solution? If it helps, I\u2019m also a member of the Grand Challenges LLC. Usually there\u2019s a certain number of NAN apartments reserved for upperclass GLC members, but I\u2019m not sure if that only applies for undergrads. I might also look into applying to be an RA if that helps. \n\nI had looked into off campus housing earlier this academic year because I\u2019m tired of twin XLs and miss my dog. Ultimately, I had decided against it because I like being close to my classes and can\u2019t afford much. If unfurnished 10th &amp; home for $1357/month really is the only option on campus, please recommend off campus options (preferably near east campus). Would really love to hear from current graduate students. Thanks!",

But like everyone else has said, I have a furnished unit with my own bedroom (and a roommate with their own bedroom), shared bathroom, kitchen, decent sized living room, and laundry (washer &amp; dryer) between the 2 of us. The rent evens out to about as much as it was when I lived in NAV (I think maybe around $200-300 more per *semester* based on my bursar payments). It's really not too bad of a walk to the Klaus/CCB/Howey and its fairly easy to use the green bus route to go back and forth between the Student Center &amp; Transit Hub stops.",

Here are some more posts:  \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/13rlz9c/american\\_childrens\\_cancer\\_benevolence\\_fund/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/13rlz9c/american_childrens_cancer_benevolence_fund/)  \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Pitt/comments/159lmj8/watch\\_out\\_for\\_possible\\_scam\\_on\\_corner\\_of\\_forbes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pitt/comments/159lmj8/watch_out_for_possible_scam_on_corner_of_forbes/)  \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/zl17zy/did\\_i\\_get\\_scammed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/zl17zy/did_i_get_scammed/)  \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/17b4zf2/cancer\\_charity\\_scam\\_on\\_mckeldin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/17b4zf2/cancer_charity_scam_on_mckeldin/)  \n\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Baruch/comments/10r89nd/why\\_is\\_no\\_one\\_doing\\_anything\\_about\\_the\\_scammers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baruch/comments/10r89nd/why_is_no_one_doing_anything_about_the_scammers/)  \n\n\nThey are not listed on any charity directories, and are tax except simply because they are linked to a church in Florida (Religious institutions are exempt from taxes), not because they have any sort of charity status. \n\nI do not know why gatech allows these people to collect on campus, can anything be done about this?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Initially, they used flattery, saying things like \"You look like a nice person\" ( this happened to me twice )  and \"You seem like a smart guy,\" which I brushed off as typical sales tactics. However, the situation became more suspicious when they showed me a donation sheet with the minimum amount listed as $100. After expressing my inability to donate that much, the representative reluctantly reduced the amount first to $50, then to $30.\n\nWhat concerned me was the extensive personal information they requested at the payment stage, including scanning my card and needing my address, like I just want to pay and move on. I'm uncertain about how this data might be used. Furthermore, the representative had agreed to all the terms and conditions on my behalf during the signing process. I had to intervene to cancel and review the terms myself. This should have been my red flag to cancel it all and move on. \n\nThe most contradictory aspect came the next day when I saw one of the organization's members smoking on campus. It struck me as highly incongruous to witness someone involved in cancer research fundraising smoking, given the well-known health risks associated with it.\n\nSo yeah this was a learning experience for me. In the future, I'll be more careful and think twice before making spontaneous donations. It's a good reminder to do a little research first.",

I see everyone constantly hanging out together, going on vacations together, going to events and parties together, and rarely people doing things alone. I'm a 3rd year so I've been here for a while, but every year I always have to go for random roommates because I don't have any friends who could room with me. There are so many events on campus and in Atlanta that I've never gone to because I don't want to go alone for either safety reasons or because it would look odd to be the only person there alone. There are so many important fun events that I end up missing out on because I never knew they were happening and even when I want to go to them, I don't have people to go with. But social aspects aside, most of the time I don't even have people to check homework answers with or study for exams with. I honestly didn't realize just how many people here have so many friends that they're constantly doing things with, but I feel like I'm completely missing out on the college experience because this is pretty much the only time of my time that I'll get to be around so many people my own age. I always thought college would give me the freedom that I could never have at home but I rarely ever leave my room except to go to class, and it seems at this point that everyone already has their established friends and they don't necessarily want to make more. I'm not trying to place blame on anyone here because I know part of it is my fault too, I'm just posting this because I want to see if this is my unique experience at GT or if other people can relate to this.

You're going to get out of college what you put into it, regardless of the school.\n\nWhat are your hobbies? I'm sure there's got to be at least one club on campus that sparks your interest. Or if you play sports just show up to the CRC and play pick-up with folks. Plenty of options you just have to get yourself out there.",

People barely go and talk to someone they don\u2019t know and everyone is very invested in their own friend group. Especially sometimes I strike up a question and I\u2019m met with dead-end stares and no engagement or follow-up conversation. \n\nI have been proven wrong a few times when I\u2019m in that right position of wanting a friend and meeting someone who also wants a friend. But I do think it\u2019s a lot harder than people say and I wish there was a more welcoming culture especially for people who aren\u2019t first-years. \n\nAnother thing is that in high school etc it was easy to be friends because you spent the whole day together. Now that everyone has separate schedules and you only have to see a person for one class it feels really hard to make genuine connections. I look forward to a one-hour club meeting every week because it\u2019s the only time I\u2019m guaranteed to see my friends, for the rest of the week I feel completely alone. \n\nIf you need a friend, reach out, I\u2019m always looking!",

A lot of people do have established friend groups, but a lot of people will be happy to meet someone new. Not all of those interactions will lead to friendship, but if you meet enough people, you'll come across some that you really click with and will hopefully become friends with. I'm a 4th year and I'm still meeting people that I become close friends with, even if I don't necessarily join their existing friend groups. Point is, it's never too late! And it's fine if the people you get to know don't coalesce into one cohesive friend group. You might become friends with a lot of people all over the place who aren't necessarily friends with each other, and sometimes that's just how it is but other times you can be the bridge to bring them together. In any case, you got this dude/dudette!",

I had to go through some trial and error to find friend groups that I really stuck with. In my first semester back in 2019, I did marching band (which was kind of a continuation of HS), and it was a lot of fun, but I didn't really vibe with a lot of people there. Once second semester started, I was a little more desperate socially, and through a weird set of circumstances I ended up accepting a bid from a fraternity. I was able to make some new friends, but it still didn't work out entirely.\n\nLong story short, the only group I ended up sticking with throughout college was VGDev, which I had been a part of since 2019, but didn't really get involved socially with until 2021. It's provided me with lifelong friends and opportunities and a deep social network, so I haven't really had to look elsewhere since. Even within classes I sometimes meet people within the club and we can discuss homework and what not.\n\nIf you want to get out of your room and step outside your comfort zone a bit, **I'm sending my personal invitation** to come to CCB 017 at 4:45 today for the first VGDev meeting of the semester (don't worry if you're not a cs major; it's chill). If going to a gathering of people and not knowing anyone is too intimidating, I'll be there and you're welcome to talk to me. I usually wear a black leather jacket near the front and if you ask around about Logan you should be able to find me. Even if the club itself doesn't interest you, it might be cool to meet some new people. \n\nI've had very intense depressive episodes throughout college where I don't leave my room for several weeks or don't talk to anyone, so I understand being on that side of things. The personality makeup and general energy of this school makes socializing weird sometimes, but that's ok. Don't assume that people \"don't want to make more friends\", because sometimes the energy that people give off and what they really want are vastly different.",

I should rephrase to remove ambiguity as you or others may misunderstand.\n\nIt is not a strategy, guide, or path to getting friends. Rather, it is a necessary building block.\n\nIn other words; it does not mean that if you are a friend to others, then they will be a friend to you. They won't necessarily. It doesn't work that way.\n\nHowever, while we can not control others' actions, we can control our own actions. One side must initiate a friendship for it to form, so if you want one, control your own action and be the initiator. Then its up to them to follow through and, metaphorically, say \"hello\" back.\n\nBy analogy, relationships are often depicted as fishing, and you must put the hook in the water to catch a fish... However, that's a potentially misleading analogy. A better one is that of building a pyramid. One person lays a series of stones, and the other person, will have the option to choose to lay stones on top, etc... You can wait for others to take the first step, or you can do the first and hardest step yourself and wait for them to take an easier step.",

The blame isn\u2019t all on you or \u201cthem.\u201d The death of our \u201cthird spaces\u201d is a big part of this too. \n\nThat being said, I think people forget that socializing is a skill and needs to be practiced. Any relationship takes work and that includes friendships. Sure, some conversations can facilitate a friendship, but without consistency you\u2019ll leave it at a surface level with that person/group. In college it can be hard to see people regularly because of schedules, but you have to put in the effort for your friends.\n\nI think that\u2019s why greek life is so popular at Georgia tech (and in general)\u2014 it takes a lot of the effort out of making plans with friends and flaking etc. the schedule of events is decided and most frat/srat people just participate in those events and boom they have a social grouping to be part of.\n\nWhile i am a pretty social person, i empathize with a lack of a group of friends to do stuff with. My time at tech was quite lonely until i really invested in a few of the people in my life. I made time to see them, do stuff with them and plan stuff with them. I understand the initial part of it sucks with making friends, but it will continue to suck if you let all the small social interactions fizzle out. \n\nEven just from a networking perspective, if you aren\u2019t making friends at Georgia tech, you are MASSIVELY missing out. Job opportunities after college come a lot easier when you know people and the people to know are your peers at GT.\nMaking friends after college doesn\u2019t get any easier\u2014 I\u2019d take advantage of GT as much as you can. \n\nMy advice to you is make the effort and get comfortable with rejection. Say hi to people and smile. Ask a classmate to grab lunch after class. Don\u2019t go back to your room in the middle of the day(I think this is one of the most important parts of having good mental health in college). Find something to do consistently so you\u2019ll be around the same people a lot. People will take your invites more seriously if you\u2019re a familiar face. \n\nThere will certainly be people who aren\u2019t receptive to it\u2014 that\u2019s on them! If you keep it up, i think you\u2019ll find people to do all the things you want to be doing. \n\nAlso, all the people who you say have a lot of friends\u2014 ask them if they feel lonely. They probably do. There\u2019s a piece of this that everyone feels, even though it might seem like they shouldn\u2019t be feeling that way.

            "selftext": "I didn't think I would be making a post about this, but it needs to be addressed as this has happened a second time to me. Georgia Tech's staff working in the offices are rude. On October 2nd of 2023, I had to make the difficult decision to put down my dog after he suffered for three days. This was a Monday morning. The first thing I did that morning was go to the vet, and they told me that the dog couldn't be saved and that it was too late. \n\nI had an exam for MATH 2550 that afternoon. After I got back from the vet, I emailed my prof. about scheduling a makeup because I obviously wasn't in the right mental place to take an exam. He told me to talk to the dean of students, so I called the office at 9:47 in the morning. I explained to the woman on the phone exactly what had happened, and the only response I got from her was to \"fill out the request to meet a dean form\" from the dean of students. She also said to me over the phone that the dean of students didn't support the death of a pet. When I asked her where the form was, she was rude and didn't give me any direct answers, so I searched for it and found it myself. I filled out and submitted the form at 10:03 AM. This is exactly what I submitted:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ey9o3b6d9dc1.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5795477a187e54dcabc5d9b8152b5aeb39cddc4c\n\nMy exam was at 2 PM, and I had cried so hard that day that I had a headache and didn't feel okay driving. I commute from home. Since there had been no word from the Dean of Students office, my dad drove me to the exam, and I took it. \n\nAt 2:47 PM, I received an email from the woman I spoke to on the phone that morning, IW. This is the copy-and-paste email that she sent back to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d8mnfkl8d9dc1.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef4467826d93a032c5ae4ab09b3ae744fe37e6eb\n\nI think the best part about this letter is the sign-off on the next page: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tof63qj9d9dc1.png?width=196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=857a029f5e6a6714adbff7b92dddc68b38f70ced\n\nThis dog was a part of my family. I don't have a mom. It's just me and my dad. That dog WAS my fucking family. At what point does death matter to Gatech? At what point is a death considered a personal emergency? At what point does my grieving matter to this school? I was absolutely disgusted and horrified by this letter, and I realized at this point, that nobody in the dean of students office is going to take me seriously. So I decided to email the dean of students himself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q9t2muedd9dc1.png?width=996&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3713ff8f9baa15333383309ad5210c1a35e1f09\n\nThe dean of students responded (and seemed genuinely concerned about the issue) and we arranged to meet on Friday morning of the same week at 2 PM. At 10:56 AM on the 6th of October, Friday morning a few hours before my meeting with the dean, I receive another email from IW. This time, it's a class absence notification letter to all of my professors. What a coincidence! It's almost as if she realized she screwed up and went back on how heartless she had been toward me! \n\nI didn't meet with the dean because I decided it was not worth pursuing any further, but I deeply regret that decision. I never had, nor do I have the intention of getting IW fired, and that is not why I am writing this Reddit post. (But maybe she should get fired if she hates talking to students so much.) All I want is an apology for the insensitive way she treated me. However, after this past week, I've changed my mind based on how I've been treated YET AGAIN by Gatech staff. \n\nI noticed an issue with one of the classes I enrolled in during phase 2 registration last week. INTA 1200 was showing up as a fall-through class on my Degree Works. I enrolled in the class intending to take it as a free elective. I emailed my advisor, and she explained to me after add/drop ended for students on Friday evening that it only counts as a social science. She told me I could go to the registrar's office to see if they could drop the class on Tuesday when campus reopened. I called the registrar's office first at 1:55 PM. The phone rang around 2 times, then cut to voicemail. No worries, I'll just head there in person. At around 3 PM, I headed into the registrar's office to speak with the staff. I spoke to a woman who told me that my advisor had the ability to change what the class counts under in Degreeworks, which my advisor emailed me was not possible. \n\nWhen I spoke, this woman kept talking over me until at one point, I just kept talking while she cut me off and it was both of us talking for a full sentence. Her comments were snippy, and the way she talked to me felt like she was talking down to me. Finally, she just pointed to a stack of business cards and told me to email them my GTID and the CRN. I did so and specified in the email that I wanted the class dropped. They emailed back saying the class had been added. That's not what I wanted. I emailed back to remind them that I wanted the class dropped. They emailed back saying they dropped the class. Lo and behold, today I looked at my class schedule, and they, in fact, did not drop that class. Instead, they dropped another class, one that I need to graduate on time. \n\nWow! If you had read my original email, you could see that I included everything that you needed to drop the class from my schedule. I even double-checked to make sure I sent the correct CRN. The kicker is that I HIGHLIGHTED the CRN and my GTID in the original email. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/po0hcpl5e9dc1.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86d89260d133c9e3f08afe28b46179288044dac4\n\nThis afternoon, the 18th of January, I called the registrar's office yet again, and FINALLY someone answered. The woman I spoke to this time corrected my issue by deleting the class that I originally wanted to delete and adding the dropped class back to my schedule. I told her exactly what happened, and I didn't even get an apology for the way I was treated by her coworker. I thanked her and just hung up after she was done. As someone who worked at a company, if a customer or someone I was serving complained about terrible service, you apologize on behalf of the staff and company regardless of whether you made the mistake or not. \n\nI want to clarify that I was never rude to any of the staff starting these conversations because I was raised with manners, unlike the staff that I had the displeasure of speaking to. I never raised my voice, cussed, or did anything to cause them to act so rudely toward me.\n\nWhy is it that so many Georgia Tech staff have absolutely 0 manners and are disrespectful to students? If you hate your job, don't work here. You work in a receptionist position that involves speaking with young adults. We are NOT children for you to disrespect and talk down to. \n\nThis is not a one-department issue. This is a systematic issue on the way Georgia Tech handles their staff and lets their staff treat students. ",

But. There should have been _someone_ who knew. Heck, the ppl I talked to on the phone to _sign up/reverse my decline_ didn't have a clue! They could only sign me up for an event they knew nothing about, and refer me to a website without any relevant info!",

Your argument isn't with me, it is with a large bureaucratic administration that is loathe to adjust its own schedules or deadlines at the request of a single individual with limited standing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want my honest appraisal on your situation, Georgia Tech has been shafting students with better standing than you, worse than they are you for longer than you've been alive.   I saw worse happen while I was there and probably many people on this sub have as well.   I wouldn't expect much.   You will undoubtedly run into individual people who are sympathetic with a desire to accommodate you but they are employees whose actions are subservient to whatever system management/regents/whomever have put into place.  \n\nI'm not familiar with the particulars of your situation but if I were in your place then I would operate on the hypothesis that making the administrator's decision to grant whatever allowance you need as easy as possible is the way to go.   This would involve as much documented notice, communication and negotiation with you and your professor as possible before getting the administration involved.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith most of my professors, the level of instruction they provided to their undergrads as a whole was a secondary or tertiary concern.   They aren't robots, but I think its wishful thinking to expect them to meet you halfway when it comes to your classwork and schedule.   If you have made the decision (justifiably or not) to not make your final your top priority then I don't know why you would expect anyone else to.    These people aren't your family and they usually aren't your friends.   The expectation is that you find a way to manage your own affairs per your own will.    From what I have personally seen, Tech is much more forgiving and helpful to students who demonstrate a lack of resources than a conscientious decision that will adversely affect their academic efforts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI do not know what else that will make the perspective of the people you are dealing with any clearer.",

And we still have a German Shepherd that I absolutely adore; if something happens to her, I will be beyond upset. So I get the pain of losing a pet. But this is where I have to give a little bit of hard life reality. It's still a pet. No matter how much we love them, even though, yes, they are part of our family, and how much losing them hurts, they are a pet.\n\nLater in life, past college and once in the work world if something like this happens (and when I say \"like this\" I am not referring to the death of a close family member, but a pet). you may have to be strong and head to work and face life. Most companies are not going to give you bereavement pay for a pet. You may have an important meeting or project deadline that can't be set aside for a pet so you may not be able to even take a vacation day to grieve. If I'm a professor, I would be hard pressed to make an excused absence for a test for a pet. I would hope you could see how that is ripe for abuse. I even had a prof in grad school at State that was not going to let me make up a missed exam - he was going to count my final double - for missing it to go to my sister's wedding (I couldn't take that risk and skipped the wedding, which was ok by me as I don't like weddings anyway! :) ) \n\nI know it is hard, but part of life is learning to deal with those difficult events with a stiff upper lip and getting on with things. A friend who manages an entire department at his business had to deny a staff member's request to stay home while a dog that was merely sick because he could not have that shift covered on short notice (it was the kind of job that didn't have work that could just be set aside until the next day).\n\nI truly hope you are doing better and that you come out of this stronger. There is no doubt in the world that love for dogs is real and intense. But, while I am sure many will attack me for this bit of \"tough love,\" it's a point of reality for life and life after school. Oh, and while I did not read all the details of the Hill, it's always been a challenge with Tech students to deal with. At least there are still commonalities in the Tech experience even today!",

Jobs that have to support things like RFP responses often have to work at the whim of the customer. I have seen that in multiple companies. And customers often set a date for an RFP response and if that date is not met, you are out (I have seen that being on the side receiving RFPs, working with a pretty intense procurement guy that was unforgiving with vendors). I've seen people work vacations, holidays, insane hours, etc. to meet client deadlines.

Do I not still have to pay to have him cremated like a human? Do I not have to pick up his ashes? I don't have to hold a funeral, sure, but neither do humans. While you claim that you are \"not insensitive,\" your comment sure is. If a company I work for in the future does not understand basic human emotions, why would I WANT to work for them anyway? My father is one of the busiest and most hardworking men I know. He works 6 days a week, close to 80 hours. Even he took two days off following my dog passing, and no one at his place of employment was a jerk about it. Your reference to the 'real world' is ridiculous. You sound like every high school teacher warning their students that the things they do won't fly in college. You've just experienced insensitive people, but that is no reason to project what you went through onto others.",

Some students that do not gain initial entry to the MSCS Program can seek entry with the OMSCS Program and potentially transfer after 1-2 semesters of completing CS coursework.\n\n2. Best to hear from a student - but in my opinion....better research opportunities/experience as you can work alongside other students and professors in-person. Attend campus events, career fairs, access campus resources, etc. MSCS is a full-time program while OMSCS is a part-time program, so students can graduate quicker and pursue their career. The MSCS Program has 11 specializations to choose from while OMSCS only has five. But there are of course some advantages to being purely online...better chances of getting into a class you want since there are more seats, easier to juggle online courses and work compared to having to go to classes at a certain day/time...the OMSCS Program admits for both Fall/Spring semesters while MSCS is Fall only....pros and cons for each. But I'm biased for on-campus.\n\n3. Again, best to hear from a student for this one...but from a staff perspective we have our general GT Career Center, and College of Computing has its own Career Services. Each entity has its own Career Fairs students may attend to connect with potential employers. Each entity offers professional development assistance like resume reviews, interview tips/practice...We have Assistantship opportunities (GTA/GRA) that offer great experience working with/under professors and the student can receive tuition waivers for participating. Our Graduate Internship Program is nice and often leads to future full-time positions after graduation. There's probably more to touch on with this, so hopefully some students share insights. \n\n4. If you mean recruiters for potential employers, yes. Many will visit throughout the semester and set up inside the College of Computing building to speak with students that may be interested in connecting and learning more. Beyond that we have the career fairs and other things I mentioned above. \n\nHopefully that helps, but I'll be interested to see what other students share as well.",

See more info below:\n\nHello All, My name is Ronith Charugundla and I am the new Director of Content of DSGT. I am currently looking for mentors that want to teach data science concepts and supervise projects for this semesters in-person bootcamp. Not only will you be able to meet and teach other people, but you will also solidify your data science knowledge. This is an opportunity to develop your teaching skills, which is highly rewarded in the workplace. In addition, studies show that teaching a new concept unfamiliar to others illustrates a high level mastery of that particular skill. If you strongly believe that you are a qualified mentor, please fill out the application form here : https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczj8ZRx-6vBW-j4XJQWeCsfUqJjvrnx8MRkywj126-7qa7Ig/viewform?usp=sf_link.

After this semester, I will have 9 credit hours remaining, and I\u2019m debating on either graduating in the summer or in December. Graduating in December would mean I could potentially get another internship. The problem is that I\u2019ve been struggling to get one. I have sent out hundreds of applications and done several interviews. I\u2019ve made it to final rounds at I think 5 or 6 companies, but two of them ended up cancelling their programs and I was unfortunately not chosen for the others. I\u2019ve been continuing to apply, but there\u2019s hasn\u2019t been anything I\u2019ve been super excited about. My main concern is that if I graduate in the summer, I will run into the same issue with full time jobs which is obviously a much bigger problem. I really don\u2019t want to go to grad school.\n\nSome important things to know is that I already have 3 internships on my resume. Also, I have my lease through the summer, so I\u2019d have a place to stay for the summer courses, whereas I\u2019d probably be commuting for the fall.\n\nWhat would you do?",

IE has a concentration in Operations Research and also a concentration in Advanced Studies in Operations Research and Statistics, while business has a concentration in Operations and Supply Chain Management. i dont think they have a BS in just OR though. since both have OR concentrations, which major would u recommend? thanks!",

I emailed the GT financial aid office and they said audit hours don\u2019t count for financial aid.

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I\u2019m out-of-state so it\u2019s harder to be comfortable with new people (and I still haven\u2019t found a group of people here I feel \u201cright\u201d with), or I didn\u2019t plan things properly by doing more clubs, or if I\u2019m just under an illusion that I\u2019m more lonely than I am because I\u2019m not keeping myself busy doing things.\n\nI just wonder if someone else is in the same boat. A lot of my friends seem unresponsive to my texts asking to hang out so I also wonder, is it common for people to just be extremely busy?\n\nAlso, thanks for taking the time to read this :) I would also be down to chat with anyone on campus who feels the same way or would be interested to do so.",

The reality is that another more people experience this than you think. The transition from high-school/ home is very different because you aren't with the same set of people for an extended period of time. It's harder to form closer relationships unlike you really hit it off from the get go. Lost of people you see may also come from the same high-school or might have done some sort of first year program. Then to add to that classes, unadorned schedules, jobs, school work it gets pretty difficult ibr. Considering I came from boarding school it was a very big shock for me but I guess finding a club or group of people you feel comfortable with and feel like are being real with you if gets better from there. I found that comfort in church on campus. I hope you find something similar aswell, be open to trying different things I guess and don't beat yourself up too mich about it. Love ya",

That said, I don't think I've made a single lasting friend through any of my classes because I've always felt like they already had their own established friends. This is part of my own problem, but you have to not worry about that as much when you're at least starting. They might have a \"core\" friend group, but I feel like most people here like to have extended networks of people.\n\nMy best advice for making actual lasting friends is kinda the same as everyone else is saying too. Not sure what your classes are like, but small group classes are definitely a place for making good connections. I have a language minor, and that allowed me to kinda trauma-bond with the rest of my class, who I still talk to now even after finishing my reqs. And if you're looking for clubs, one that I haven't seen anyone else recommend so far is Alternative Service Break! I applied for it at one of my lowest mental points (in part, because of my social lacking), and it really did a world of a difference for me. If you have the money to spare (and it's still running), I 100% recommend.\n\nMore than anything though, please remember that gt can feel especially isolating to everyone, so it's not just you. I think we have a lot of great people here, but the foundational campus culture still has a lot of inherent negativity that can get to everyone. I hope you find your way out of this slump though :)",

The admission process is divided in two steps. The first step is a check of general requirments (english, degree etc.), and there is not a GPA requirment (at least for aerospace). So, if I have all the general requirments, am I automatically included for the second admission step?\n2. The second step is based on GPA. Is the GPA evaluated by a general commission or by your potential professor?\n3. What happens in the second step if you already worked with, so you have a strong recomandation by a GT professor?\n4. If I have a Master degree, is it a strenght point or is it not useful?\n5. Someone in this group have applied for the PhD program for Fall 2024 (if yes, you can contact me and we can stay in touch)\n\nThank you!",

Really it all comes down to whether you end up with good roommates or not because everything else is fine for the most part.\n\nI did have some fairly frequent HVAC issues though which was an issue in the summer heat, and staying on a higher floor of the building can be pretty awful because there's a ton of people and two elevators. If you can make sure to stay within the first 3-4 floors just to be able to get down the stairs because I can promise there'll be times you're not gonna be able to get up or down with the elevator and still make it to class on time.",

Our office is right next to GA Tech campus and I\u2019m seriously considering to get back to school. I\u2019m not interested in MBA or Masters, can I still pursue PhD in computer science fields like Machine learning or Quantum computing while I\u2019m working full time at current job.?I can squeeze 20 to 30 hours every week beyond 8-5 for few years. Is it even possible and what\u2019s the process? Thank you!",

Classes you can generally skip if necessary; you can load up all the work for one furious evening. PhD advisors (and I had an awesome, understanding one) want you around for prompt idea exchange, helping out other people in the lab, etc. You're effectively their fulltime employee; that's what they'll be expecting in any case.\n\nIf you have a full or part-time job outside the PhD, you may feel that you are between two worlds, without belonging to either one. Neither the university nor the workplace is well adapted to dealing with the other, and each may place demands that are incompatible with those of the other. Your biggest problems may be the double commute, scheduling difficulties, and isolation.\n\nThe good thing is that there's almost no conceivable career path that requires concurrent intense industry work and acquisition of a PhD. If you're thinking about jobs that require a pro forma PhD, get one at GSU. If you want to go academic, save up some cash and do your PhD properly. If you want industry, the time you'd spend on a PhD can be much more profitably applied to industrial work.\n\nNo hiring manager prefers \"PhD\" over \"Generated XXX million dollars of revenue\" except an academic one.",

I have gone in person to the registrar and they turned me away and said they can't do anything and I have to have the course department move me or get some permit. They were super vague and it seemed like they didn't really know what they were talking about, but they said there was nothing they could do (and were super indifferent to my problem, like, I'm trying to graduate and I'm struggling here, at least show a little sympathy??). I went in person to see my advisor and they weren't even in person today. The guy at the front desk told me only my advisor can do anything about my registration stuff.\n\nI feel like I'm in a circular loop. What can I do to get the courses I need to graduate?

There are a lot of people at GT (and in the world) who would love to do something to fix a problem, but can't. Those cant's can be anything from they aren't allowed to to its not physically possible to do. Pretty much every room, staff office, and every faculty member at Tech is truly running at the limit of what they can do. They care immensely - and that care is exhausting if you don't put boundaries on it - they just can't make classrooms bigger.\n\nI know it sometimes seems like it should be easy to open up more seats, hell you might not care if you sit on the floor. But everyone answers to someone about that decision - and before you think I mean President Cabrera, I actually mean the fire marshal.\n\nI would add the constant refrain from GT students that X, Y, or Z office or person *doesn't care* is often really hurtful to those people because they do care, they do wish they could do something, and they can't. Hearing that over and over again costs us good people and demoralizes those who stay. When advisors have 100s of students (they shouldn't), who are all having registration problems (they shouldn't), and there isn't anything they can do besides advocate upwards (which they do) to get told that they don't care all the time would drive me to drinking.\n\nI get the frustration - truly because I've been there - but there are more constructive approaches. That they don't fix it is not even close to evidence they don't care - and saying it is has real negative impacts.",

In addition, even when you don't get points for an item, any approved item will go towards your overall item count which raises your position on the leaderboard and unlocks a higher daily limit on the number of images you can submit.",

It\u2019s either a city or state maintained street, and as others said it\u2019s an active construction zone. If you would like to discuss it being fixed faster I recommended finding the project manager for the construction project and consulting them. Odds are that\u2019s a waste of time because they have a fixed budget and fixed schedule. If you want a faster timeline or higher budget you\u2019d need to get the state legislature to pass a bill to implement that.\n\nBasically all that to say welcome to construction. It sucks for everyone, it\u2019ll be fixed in maybe a couple years if you\u2019re lucky.",

            "title": "Don't let your Football hype die down, Join the International Simulation Football League!",
            "selftext": "First off, I want to thank the r/GaTech mod team for allowing this post! With all the hype our team has gotten over this last season after finally ditching G**** and getting our first bowl win since 2016 I wanted to give y'all a way to keep the hype going into the Offseason. I joined this league back in March of last year and have really enjoyed it. Though there are some uGA fans in the league so it would be nice to have a few more GT people to help balance it out.\n\nThe 45th season of the International Simulation Football League is wrapping up, which means that it is a great time to create a player and join! The ISFL is a free online sim league where you create a professional football player and control their journey through the pros from pre-draft to retirement. With over 30 player archetypes to choose from, you can be anything from a pass-catching running back to a ball hawking safety or even a strong legged kicker. \n\nYour player will compete in games (simulated using Draft Day Sports: Pro Football 2021) throughout the week that premiere on [our YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@ISFL) nightly. Each 16-game season lasts about 6 weeks, including playoffs, followed by a 2 week offseason. Complete stats are recorded on the [league index](https://index.sim-football.com/ISFLS45/), and we also have cool user-made tools to keep track of [historical records](https://isfl-bot.herokuapp.com/) and [our very own Hall of Fame](https://wiki.sim-football.com/view/List_of_ISFL_Hall_of_Fame_inductees).\n\nWith hundreds of players and over 20 teams across the developmental and major leagues, the ISFL is also an active online community. Joining a team is not only a chance to see your player succeed, but also to hang out with fellow users in the Discord server that serves as your team\u2019s locker room. You\u2019ll be joining a tight-knit group of like-minded people who enjoy getting a bit nerdy about football and root together for your players when they take the simulated field.\n\n## Sounds Great! How Do I Start?\n\nIf you want to jump in right away, a great place to start is to join the [ISFL Rookie Discord](https://discord.gg/mPHkNKcWdH). Our team of rookie mentors will be happy to answer any questions and assist you with creating your player and getting started on your ISFL career! If you want to read more about the process first, we have a great [Rookie Guide](https://forums.sim-football.com/showthread.php?tid=6235) written up on the league forums and a [series of tutorial videos on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCr9BsbjaE3qnGZ9ZX54rVZIRWtu5bHbi&amp;si=aIVhYe_w70l3IdWj) as well to walk you through the player creation process.\n\n## What Happens After I Create My Player?\n\nAfter making your player, you'll be scouted by teams that are entirely run by other users in the league and drafted to a developmental team in the DSFL Draft on Thursday, January 25. Just like the games, the YouTube channel streams all our offseason events including drafts, awards shows, and the Prospect Bowl that your new player will compete in!\n\nDuring your player\u2019s career, you can improve their attributes by spending 10-15 minutes completing optional tasks each week, like predicting the winners of each game or mocking the 1st round of the draft. The league is 100% free - there is no \"pay to win\" and nothing costs real money to unlock. You will earn fake league currency through your player's contracts or through creating content like written articles, graphics, or podcasts. You can use it to further upgrade your player and do fun things like collecting trading cards of ISFL players!\n\n## Quick Links\n\nThanks for reading! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments of this post, in the Rookie Discord, or on our subreddit, r/SimulationFootball\n\nRookie Discord: https://discord.gg/mPHkNKcWdH   \nRookie Guide: https://forums.sim-football.com/showthread.php?tid=6235   \nCreate-a-Player Tool: https://forums.sim-football.com/form.php?formid=1",

Today I checked the GT transfer pathway pages and it stated that Georgia residency was required for this pathway. I do not remember seeing this at all before today and I have checked multiple times of the requirement before. IF I really missed it, then it wouldn't even make sense for me to have gotten the pathway in the first place as I am not a Georgia Resident. \n\nDoes anyone know anything about this?

Plus, for some reason this sounds really close to defamation (they claim you are academically dishonest and lack integrity, which you have proof of the contrary) and could jeopardize your future, even if you didn't actually break a law.\n\nAlso, do they allow you to see or hear the reasoning behind their verdict? Who made the verdict, anyway? Do you know if they were completely impartial? Do you have any reason to suspect that this professor might have it out for you? That last one sounds a bit outlandish, especially for this school, but in a scenario like this one, you can't afford to rule anything out without conclusive evidence of the contrary.\n\nLike I said, I've never gone through this before, so my instinct is to look at it through a legal lens, especially if you had to provide evidence of your own innocence and how this might affect your ability to succeed later in life.\n\nBest of luck to you. OSI is no joke, but dont let them kill your future. If you really are innocent, I hope you make it through this.",

My last class in my curriculum gave me a glimpse at a field I didn't realize would have rounded out my skills exactly how I wanted them to be, and I didn't know it was even an option until the semester I got out. Would have made getting into the Master's program a breeze.\n\nProbably should have done more extracurriculars than just music, which I'd already been doing since grade school. I had many opportunities that were actually put right in front of me, but I didn't take them.\n\nIf I had gotten the mental help I needed years ago so that I wasn't so busy keeping my head above water academically, I'd have been able to do said extracurricular activities as well as internships and co-ops, maybe even graduated earlier or done BSMS.\n\nBut what's done is done. There's no changing what's already happened. If you have regrets, then the best you can do is either move on, or find a way to get what you've always wanted before it's really too late. Plus, you never know if the things you weren't able to achieve are what closes certain doors so that you can adapt and find a new path.\n\nJust because I got out doesn't mean getting help won't help me to get a job. And there's such a thing as hobbies outside of having a career. I've heard that those special interests showing up on a resume can help your chances of getting a position.\n\nIn that same conversation about minoring in ID, I also found that a Master's in ID isn't barred from people who didn't get the minor; it just takes longer to get (3 years, which, for me, is a *blessing* compared to how long it took to get out the first time around). And I likely wouldn't have even considered it so seriously if it weren't for my academic struggles keeping me from just getting an MS in my original BS field of study.\n\nDon't let your regrets eat at you, folks. Just find a way to move forward. You might have another chance waiting just down the road.",

By adding ID as a curriculum, you will essentially be learning how to make products that not only function properly and safely but also look appealing to the eye with an ergonomic nature. I'd say that's a great way to round out your skills and make you look more competitive in the job market.\n\nTaking on extracurriculars and Hobbies can also help round out your skills. Not everything you do has to be engineering all the time. As I said previously, I graduated as a mechanical engineer, but I was a musician for *much* longer. They are two very different fields that have given me a diverse skillset and mindset that spans both STEM and the arts. If anything, this is why I might go back for an ID masters: to make useful things that actually look cool and easy to interact with.\n\nAs for academic habits, if you think you have any mental health issue that may be at play (neurodivergence like ADHD/ASD, dyslexia, etc.), get professionally tested so that the Office of Disabilities Services can help you. I didn't seek help until my last semester, and if I had, I likely would have graduated with honors.\n\nOtherwise, work with your teachers, and build a positive rapport with them by going to office hours and talking with them about anything you don't get. If you can't make it to meetings, then post on Piazza. Take charge and start the group chats; that's where you can ask questions unfiltered, and you never know who else is fighting the same question. Plus at some point people start posting memes to alleviate the stress.\n\nBest of luck!",

There were several students (mostly CS) at Tech who got severance packages from companies before ever starting work because their job offers were rescinded due to economic conditions.\n\nThen the 9/11 attacks happened.  I was actually getting dressed to go to a GT job fair that morning but never made it (they ended the job fair early due to the attack).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few months later I did an informal poll of people I knew who graduated ChemE my year and roughly 1/3 of us were working chemE jobs.  Another 25-30% of us were hiding in grad school and the rest of us were either unemployed, underemployed, or working non-ChemE type jobs.   Almost all  of the ChemE's who were gainfully employed moved across the country for their jobs.\n\nI worked for 4 years at a gym and doing odd gig type work until I got a sales job with a manufacturer which I eventually transitioned to engineering.    Part of the reason it took me so long is because I was dead set against leaving Atlanta.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven so, the environment was bad.  I was friends with  a CS grad who did clerical type work in an office for a couple of years until she was able to find a programming job.   CS came roaring back about half a decade later, but ChemE has never quite recovered.    When I started at Tech ChemE had the highest average starting salary out of all the engineering majors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I think that CS has a different issue... the jobs are widely recognized as having a high pay ceiling for a relatively small amount of training and middling difficulty-of-curriculum.    CS grads/students are everywhere.... whereas ChemE never had the same issue of lots of people flocking to the discipline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea what will happen moving forward... the barrier to entry in CS (getting your first job) is already pretty high.   You'd think that would suppress wages but Tech companies are the main ones that are flush with cash... they can easily afford to keep paying high salaries.       I wonder if it will work out like the legal industry where you have a massive disparity between the higher and lower earners.  Dunno.  Good luck to you all.",

I wanted to let everyone know that we just launched Coursicle Chat at Georgia Tech, which is basically a group chat for every class. We've seen a lot of people use it at Tech so far to switch sections. We launched at a handful of schools last semester and the response was solid so we decided to roll it out further. It's a very new product, so would love any feedback you have!\n\nHere's a screenshot of our growth since last week after we launched at more schools if you're curious: [https://imgur.com/a/s8IhVeZ](https://imgur.com/a/s8IhVeZ)",

What are my options? Has anyone dealt with this before? The advisor didn't seem too confident about the next steps. I have never needed to check degree works as all my design course grades were accurate on Canvas. \n\nTLDR: Degree Works has the wrong final grade but I only noticed after a year.

            "selftext": "Hey everyone! I did my undergrad at Tech, and I was a TA for CS 2110 for two years. Around February of last year, Dr. Conte had the idea of writing a toolchain for the LC-3, hoping to make the connection between C and Assembly more obvious. I took him up on the offer, and I worked on it last Spring and Summer. Since we ultimately decided not to incorporate it into the course, we made the toolchain open source: [https://github.com/lc-3-2](https://github.com/lc-3-2). It includes the compiler, a simulator, and a rudimentary C library. The compiler is fairly powerful - it successfully compiles the C library, as well as the `coremark` benchmarks.\n\n*Note that this is for the LC-3.2 architecture, not the LC-3.* The LC-3.2 is based off the LC-3b ([https://users.ece.utexas.edu/\\~patt/19s.460n/handouts/appA.pdf](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~patt/19s.460n/handouts/appA.pdf)), which is itself a byte-addressable variant of the LC-3. The LC-3.2 was extended to have a 32-bit word size (hence the name), and it provides instructions to load/store words along with the already existing load/store instructions for 16-bit halfwords and for bytes. As such, *the LC-3.2 is not binary compatible nor assembly compatible with the LC-3*, so don't complain to me when you can't use the compiler to cheese the assembly assignments.\n\nIf you're the kind of person to do so, I have a few ideas for extensions:\n\n* In theory, it should be possible to compile any language using LLVM to the LC-3.2. Maybe you can get Rust or Zig running?\n* The C Library is not complete. It does not deal with files, for example. Maybe you can add that functionality?\n* The compiler doesn't use `R4` as a global pointer. Maybe you can get it to do that?\n* Using what I have, it might be possible to make a compiler for the LC-3b. The main difference is that words are 16-bit, but LLVM can handle that. Getting a compiler for the LC-3 might be harder since LLVM assumes `i8` exists, but what do I know.",

At any point, I feel like there are easily less than 50% the courses needed for any track being offered to students. This makes sense - it is a massive course list. But, all the while, new classes with ambiguous topics keep popping up; it's a bit confusing.\n\nSomething as simple as dynamically updating the MSCS requirements website with the current semester's offerings would make registration MUCH more tolerable. It would also temper everyone's expectations. And then they could maintain the complete list in a separate section of the page.\n\nOf course, the other long-term solution is to try and offer more classes, but that comes with universal problems that every CS department is dealing with, and GT has been hiring a lot of faculty recently.",

I know both IE and ITM students who have done tech consulting and usually consulting firms do recruit ITM students specifically for tech consulting if that's what you're interested in. I know a lot of ITM students who also go on to do the GT master's in analytics program to go deeper in analytics and that degree is more technical.",

To be honest, there was a virtual meeting with the department professors but, unfortunately, I did not manage to attend. Anyway, I already was interested in the work of some professors, so I got in touch and I managed to get into a couple of interviews. After that, things was going good with one professor but he told me he is waiting on funding approval before he can bring me in. Eventually, he told me that the fund was not approved and there is nothing more to do.\n\nIt was a bummer and left me in a bad place because in other universities if you get accepted then it's all done; you join the school and start studying some fundamentals and during your first semester you start looking for a supervisor.\n\nWhat I want to know is how the process of acceptance actually is at GTECH?\n\nLike, If I have to contact professors myself, then what is the benefit of having an application and paying application fees!\n\nThanks",

                    "body": "This is why I strongly encourage anyone interested in an ME or AE PhD to **only** attend GT if they have funding and an advisor coming in. Not only are ME and AE students paid 2/3 the stipend of CS/ECE/IC students, but they hide the fact that students are on the hook for tuition if they can't get funding on their own (which is very challenging to do). Coupled with also needing to figure out their own advisor situation, it's a nightmare for students that most other departments and virtually all other universities have solved for decades.\n\nWhat results is the ME and AE departments over-admit PhD students who commit to GT because they've been accepted to a top program (and GT ME tells them \"funding will be determined at a later date\"), only to later hit them with \"you need to pay $16,000/semester because you don't have an advisor yet\", while **also** giving no support for getting an advisor. ECE does not assign advisors at the start, however they guarantee a TA-ship to cover tuition. ME tosses the full financial cost onto the student and has very, very few TA slots that are intentionally reserved for senior students.\n\nMany ME PhD students drop out, switch over to a masters after not being able to find an advisor, join toxic labs just because they need funding, or end up TAing their entire PhD (and borrowing from family to cover basic living expenses). It promotes a culture across many ME labs where advisors abuse the power differential to force students into vulnerable positions.\n\nCommonly, ME PhD students are strung along meaningless projects for years that don't advance their research nor end in publications, or their advisors take full credit for the students work, and students have no recourse as they are dependent on their advisor to stay out of serious financial debt. The ME department's ombudsman program is slow, inefficient, and has virtually no resources to financially support students in dire situations.\n\nIt's purely exploitative and is shameful to GT's reputation. I sincerely hope the faculty reading this call attention to these issues. Personally, I think you dodged a bullet by your potential advisor pulling out \u2014 I know other students in similar situations whose advisors instead just moved the goal posts a semester or two and had the student pay the ($16k/sem) tuition themselves while they figured out funding.\n\nGo elsewhere and avoid GT, the name on your resume is not worth it.",

I went again around 12PM to inquire about the appropriate time to pick up the package from a staff member. The staff member informed me that if I came around 4:30 PM, all the packages would be sorted and available for pickup.\n\nAt 4:30 PM, during a conversation with the same staff member, The GLC OFFICE MANAGER abruptly intervened, stating that if I hadn't received an email confirmation, they couldn't assist in confirming the package. When I attempted to explain the urgency of the situation, the MANAGER cut my words and without listening to me, she even shouted at me, refusing to let me speak. Despite following the guidelines, the manager's dismissive behavior made me feel like it was not her concern. She even gestured for me to stay away from the mailroom, seeming to be using her authority in a way that felt like she was ignoring someone in need of an explanation.\n\nI had no choice but to leave, as the MANAGER continuously interrupted me without listening. Upon returning with my husband, the MANAGER's attitude changed drastically, engaging in a conversation with him without shouting or interrupting. However, when discussing the situation for almost 10 minutes, she did not genuinely apologize, merely mentioning that if she unintentionally caused embarrassment, she would apologize, but it did not seem sincere.\n\nI still believe I asked a legitimate question to the staff, and the manager's treatment, especially towards an individual with limited language proficiency, raises concerns about even discrimination, including gender and racial bias. I hope my concerns can be appropriately conveyed to her for resolution.",

He reached out to me recently saying that he's going to \"speak\" with the graduate chair. I just don't want to be excited for something which is seems close to impossible.\n\nI assumed TA's are finalized long before the end of the previous semester. However, with how the Professor spoke with me - it seems like he is unaware of any TA being assigned to his class.\n\n\nShould I keep any hope? As an international student getting the TAship would save me from a lot of debt.\n\nEdit: as more background, our department gave a form to fill out regarding this long before the end of the semester. I didn't get any offer at that time. I got a generic reply saying \"I will keep your application open until the next semester if any opportunities open up\"",

            "selftext": "This is gonna be half genuine question, half self-reassurance. I\u2019m a second year who had the honor of doing an Amazon internship the summer after my first year due to the AFE program. I applied this year to Meta University for their second year program, just to be able to tell myself I applied somewhere (not really expecting much + Amazon gave me a RO). Instead, not only did they contact me back, they bumped me up to regular SDE internship application instead of MU. This put into perspective just how unprepared I was - I never did LeetCode except for maybe two questions, I had my DS/Algo class literally last semester, and overall feel unconfident. \n\nNow, I am procrastinating doing the OA due on Thursday cause I already know I am not passing it, but I just am now thinking about how foreign it all looks to me. Just looking at some of the LC prep questions was making my head spin. I know it comes with LC practice, which I am gonna start this semester, but now I am curious how y'all who are fulltime SDEs find your understanding of CS compared to your jobs? \n\nI am asking this in terms of both understanding + prep for interviews as well as what you do in your day to day job. When I was working at Amazon, I understood most of it, but some of it I just had to ask for assistance on. I feel like the reason they even gave me a RO was because AFE's almost always get returns unless you really couldn't do anything for your project. On top of this, im doing people + media because I genuinely like these threads, but now I am worried that I should switch into another thread because my knowledge after graduating won't be adequate enough.\n\nIdk.... I guess what I want to know is how y'all feel now that you are full-time working. Was the degree enough of a foundation to feel comfortable doing SDE work? Did you do practice on the side, and if so, what and where? Any tips to help someone prep for both the SDE job and interviews?",

Yes, LeetCode helps you sharpen your skills, but it's not as good as the pattern recognition you're learning in either of those classes.\n\nIn terms of YOUR ACTUAL WORK AS AN INTERN: not quite irrelevant, but close... I did 4 internships, 2 of which were with a M(F)AANG, and only one of those internships did I actually USE those LeetCode/CS3510/CS1332 DSA skills I had learned.\n\nTl;Dr: study data structures and algorithms to get the job or to move jobs. \n\nOther than that, build your resume with hard and/or unique projects, and be deeply involved in them.\n\nThis also means continuing to study LeetCode/HackerRank every so often to brush up on your skills should you need to move or find another job for whatever reason.",

Transitioning from BSCS to the professional world could be rough if you're expecting it to be the same. I learned more about what I would be doing in the professional world from the 3 months I spent as an Amazon SDE intern than I did in coursework at Tech.\n\nNo real way around LC-like assessments other than to grind IMO. University hiring bars are a little easier than experienced roles, but I made sure I could reliably solve LC easy/mediums and mostly solve LC hard when I last searched for a new role. Daily, intentional practice helps a lot. I found tracking my progress via correctness, timeliness, and difficulty helped me stay motivated as I could see my trajectory trend up. Writing brief, 3 - 5 sentence summaries explaining why I chose (or should have chosen \ud83d\ude09) the right data structure (HashSet vs Trie vs plain ol' Array, etc.) or right approach (Divide and Conquer, 2 pointer, etc.) was useful as well since I found recognizing which tool to use or how to adapt them to new problems tricky at first.\n\nFor practice on the side-if you can find any large project through clubs or orgs or research to contribute to it would give you something to talk about in interviews. The closest I came to what working in the industry was like was when I contributed, reviewed, and collaborated with others on these larger projects. My experience has been that for the most part, its always better to implement simple solutions than complex ones and figuring that out is almost always a result of teamwork.\n\nAs for threads, I wouldn't change them unless you're targeting specific roles or companies that would be better described by other combinations (i.e. Intelligence for AI or Devices for embedded). In general, university hires or SWE 1 equivalents are expected to need significant help/direction and threads at Tech don't really alleviate this. Curricula are impossible to keep up to date with the pace of new tech and tests/homework usually don't expect anything more than correctness from your solutions. Expect to ask a lot of questions about tech stacks and design approaches-teams appropriate for junior engineers should know that you'll need these answers.\n\nYou're likely to encounter much more obtuse problems in school/leetcode than in your industry work. Better implementations of the tricky stuff already exist, and your teams will appreciate simple solutions over complex ones. The hard part is building useful, maintainable, and extensible software on time and as a team using a given toolset.\n\nTL;DR: Focus on large project, collaborative work if you can. Grind leetcode since too many roles still use those sorts of screens. Don't change threads because you think they'll better prepare you for industry. FAANG on your resume opens doors-you're ahead of the game if you're a second year with an internship. Good luck!",

Personally I find LeetCode interviews to be absolutely ridiculous and a terrible way to judge a candidate's actual ability, but that's a topic for another time. Keep in mind that there are PLENTY of companies out there that do actual job interviews, and while they may not pay crazy SV money, they also tend to be in lower COL areas where the money goes a lot farther, and you'll still be making more by yourself at 22 than most middle-aged families.\n\nAsking coworkers for help is a very good thing to do in general. Nobody expects you to know everything, especially straight out of college, and knowing when &amp; how to ask seniors for help is one of the most important soft skills for succeeding at the start of your career. The degree gets you to a baseline level of knowledge, but everything beyond that is learned on the job, largely through the help and mentorship of your senior engineers. I thought I was fairly decent at C++ when I started my job, but now after 5 years of working with modern C++ every day, I realize I knew absolutely NOTHING back then. \n\nRemember that your CS degree is teaching you a lot of the theory behind programming, but very little in the way of practical skills. In the real world, the practical skills are much more important. You can't learn how to add a feature to a project that's been going on for 10+ years in one semester. Nobody reading a resume is going to care about what classes you've taken, but being an active, contributing member to an extracurricular project can make you stand out because those tend to be a bit closer to working at a company.",

I am researching on transferring to Georgia Tech for my second year.  Ultimately, I want to puruse a Ph.D. in Pure Mathematics post undergraduate years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I am looking into Georgia Tech's Mathematics Requirements and Pure Mathematics Requirements, I noticed that they tend to be more focused on Applied Mathematics and the junction between CS and Math.  Some courses which interested me and satisfied the Pure Math Concentration/Math requirements include Math 4108 Abstract Algebra II, Math 4318 Real Analysis II, Math 4431 Introduction to Topology, Math 4432 Intro to Algebraic Topology, Math 4441 Differential Geometry, Math 4699 Undergrad Research, Math 4802 Math Problem Solving, Econ 3161 Econometric Analysis (I would also love to double major in Economics).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would love the community's insights on three aspects, which I will list below for ease of reading:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. How heavily do the upper division mathematics courses rely on the use of computer skills/programming.  I know that mathematics majors will eventually learn programs like LATEX, SageMath, Python, etc., but I wanted to know if the mathematics courses tend to comprise of heavy background knowledge of programming skills/CS-related projects. \n2. What is the outlook for Pure Mathematics at Georgia Tech?  I listed a few courses that felt more \"Pure Mathematics\" than \"Applied Mathematics\" above, but as I am still a newbie at college mathematics, I would love the community's perspective.  Are there many pure math courses/opportunities at Tech?\n3. Finally, I would love the community's evaluation of the strength of Tech's Pure Mathematics in terms of applying for a Ph.D. in Pure Mathematics.  I know Tech has a really strong Applied/Computational Mathematics department which sets students up for good graduate programs, but what about Pure Mathematics?  Is there a lot of pure math research at Georgia Tech?  I would love to be involved in Pure Mathematics Research. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for your time!

I personally was a math major that wanted to focus on data science and probability/statistics, not so much pure (i just noticed they added a data science concentration recently! Dang, wish that was around when I was attending still). I may not be able to fully answer your questions, but I'll give the insight I do have (also I'd keep in mind that it's still early on in your college career- my math interests shifted a lot from when I first started to when I graduated, so I wouldn't try to force a concentration from the get go):\n\n1. Upper level math courses for the most part did not require any high level understanding of any programming languages. If one was used, you were given a thorough rundown of what you needed to know. Some professors preferred you turn work in with LATEX, but that's about it. For math majors, you do not need to do a senior project either, so I'd say programming is minimal for the most part.\n\n2. Curious, what math courses have you taken so far? I really think you need to take the first abstract Algebra and real analysis classes before you have a good idea of your interest levels in pure math. Most of the professors do research into pretty cool fields (perhaps topology for something pure math-ish? There was one prof that i vaguely remember that is in that direction), and I'm sure you would be able to find one that does something you'd be interested in. I will say though, professors sometimes also teach classes not related to their research field, so you may need to ask around to find the right prof! Overall though, I think the outlook for pure math is pretty solid for undergrad- you'll be able to build a solid foundation towards pure math easily- as the bridge courses sorta force you to anyway (abstract algebra, real analysis, complex analysis).\n\n3. I can't really provide much insight for this one, hopefully someone else can chime in. I loved the entire math department- everyone worked together, and if you put in good effort and genuine interest, you will be taken care of, and you'll do super well. You don't have to wait until you've finished undergrad to look into doing research at all- you can try and get in immediately, hence me recommending you find a prof doing research in something you're interested in asap. Loved undergrad, just not sure what it's like postgrad. \n\nI really like the selection of classes you listed though if you want to do pure math! I will warn you, they're all pretty rigorous. I was never the strongest at pure math so you'll likely fare better than I did, but just a fair warning haha. Also- I'd prioritize taking classes that you find interesting, even if it's not the exact concentration you want to do (I recommend 4032 combinatorial analysis and 4280 info theory a lot!). It's a pretty small tight-knit community here I'd say for math, hope you're able to find what you're looking for!",

Tech offers a lot more graduate pure math classes and you can use them to fulfill your degree requirements.\n\nTech offers a few REUs in the summer and there is some advantage of getting in as a Tech student since the people running it might know you. You can check the past REUs to see the pure math projects. Tech has a big combinatorics focus which is also an area that will most likely lead to publications as undergrads.\n\nOther than REU, I don\u2019t know many undergrads doing research with professors. I can see that some professors are already overwhelmed with grad students, but some professors don\u2019t have many students so it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask. For areas that are not as accessible as combinatorics (which are most areas), grad schools don\u2019t expect you to do publishable research. Doing reading courses on some advanced topics with experts of those topics would serve you well because 1. It shows you can handle the difficulty of near research-level math 2. A world expert on this topic can write a strong reference letter for you. 3. Maybe you can find an accessible research topic as a result. In that sense Tech can help you achieve that. Plus there is the directed reading group led by postdocs and grad students if professors aren\u2019t available.\n\nAlso if you are serious about math PhD, I would caution against double-majoring Econ as nothing there would help you in your career (pure math or industry) and you would waste precious time for your grad courses progression. Learning programming would be quite helpful since math academia has gotten so competitive that many PhDs won\u2019t stay in academia and end up coding one way or another. It\u2019s best if you learn the skills (e.g. Python) early on.",

I understand there were probably issues with people hoarding classes with this kind of structure, but it still sucks knowing that I have to either give up my spot and do an 8am (I barely woke up when I did 930 classes) or just pray that my waitlist will make it. Again, I rant about all this knowing this is probably the best design for registration that they've got, but I still am upset that I am junior status and continue to struggle getting multiple classes.",

Maybe you breeze through classes, but most find higher level math courses require a lot of time commitment, especially in terms of independent study time.  If your goal is teaching, perhaps back off the double major, just take or audit the math you're interested in, and focus on being a really good teacher.  I doubled in math and engineering and the coursework really ate up my time for research projects.  I feel like it was worth it for me, but mostly because I enjoyed studying math and less because the credential has been professionally valuable.  My concern reading this is TAing is a position in which others rely on you, so half assing is not acceptable in the same way one can half ass research when courses get tough.",

But now that I think about it I suppose for me right now there isn't much of a benefit cause there isn't a pay either.

I do enjoy studying math and I suppose one of my reasons for the math double major is for \"recreational\" reasons so to speak. Either way I am aware of the huge workload and will do something if things turn out to be more difficult.\n\nI did turn down the offer for TA, it probably makes more sense to focus on research.",

If anything, that\u2019s when they need you the most \u2014 and that\u2019s when you\u2019ll be the least able to do the bare minimum as a TA, let alone go above and beyond. Overworked TAs are not good TAs. If you\u2019re juggling seven finals and undergrad research obligations along with needing to be responsive via email/piazza, holding office hours, and grading / proctoring, you will simply not be able to be as present as you should be (or, hopefully, as much as you should *want* to be). \n\nLooking back, my personal opinion is that top students would probably be able to get As and Bs even if recitations and review sessions didn\u2019t exist. TAs make the biggest difference for those who would\u2019ve otherwise gotten a C/D (or at least that level of understanding, regardless of their grade) but ended up doing well, or even great, thanks to you. It can also be the crucial safety net that prevents certain people from failing a weed-out course and rage quitting on their major too early.\n\nTAing can be a very rewarding experience if done properly, but if it\u2019s going to be juggled with eight other priorities, a) you\u2019ll do the bare minimum and it won\u2019t really be worthwhile for you, and b) it\u2019ll be flat-out detrimental to those whose learning and overall course experience hinges on you.",

Are there any other such activities with regards to being a \"covid freshman\"? \n\nThanks!\n\nP.S. I guess this is on and off for me, but there are certain times when it really gets to me that I am almost done (it's that Tech Stockholm Syndrome everyone talks about lol) and I would regret not doing certain things. I know it's very common to feel this as graduation gets closer and that it's natural, but for those who dealt with those feelings, what assuaged it?",

When we moved to blue on white with Bobby Ross starting in 1987, it was always odd to me but over time I have accepted that blue is the third color of our set. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t hate the black look, I think it\u2019s confusing to our identity - and has some seriously bad vibes thanks to its use in 2020 and that Bowling Green game this year - so I would prefer we retire it to our history. I thought we looked more like the New Orleans Saints or Purdue this year than Georgia Tech. And given how we played, that\u2019s probably good we were incognito! \ud83e\udd23\n\nI agree I have never seen a blue yellow jacket so I am ok with Buzz still using black. I am primarily a white and gold/yellow guy. I do have navy tops and hats, but I almost never wear them to games. But I do not buy black and yellow Tech gear for the above reasons.",

Certainly not in the modern era, and all the pics I've seen of the pre-Dodd years were always (mostly) solid jerseys.\n\nPer some of the discussion above, Dodd also was a fan of white jerseys for home. Our colors are \"White and Gold,\" not \"Gold and White,\" so perhaps that has somethign to do with it. \n\nIf you're interested in the history of Tech football, go find a used copy of Dodd's Luck to get an idea of his perspective on his time at Tech. It's a good read, as is \"Focused on the Top\" (about the 1990 National Championship season), :Dress Her in White and Gold,\" and \"You Dropped It, You Pick It Up\" (about the 222-0 Cumberland game - hard to find, and currently runs &gt;$400 on most used book sites, but a fun read.)\n\nWelcome! If you haven't learned the words to \"Up With the White and Gold,\" \"I'm a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech,\" and the Budweiser song, get to it!\n\nBTW - it's tough to come up with my favorite football uniform combo. While I loved the navy jerseys from the 1990 year, as well as the mustard jerseys from the Calvin Johnson era, I think the best would be Gold/White/Gold, followed by White/Gold/White. What can I say, I'm a purist.",

Please don't freak out, but my Uncle went to UGA's law school, so I was in Georgia gear at the game, but I was really pulling for both (I know, it's forbidden to pull for Dawgs and Jackets, but I have deep respect for both schools). Anyways, I have been to Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate ever since I was little.\n\nBut just for clarification so I don't get killed here, I have been a UGA fan my whole life due to my Uncle going to their law school(so I actually do have a reason to pull for them \ud83d\ude02), but even as a little kid, I always liked Buzz and Georgia Tech (I even got a picture with Buzz as an 8 year old with Georgia on \ud83d\ude02). Even though I liked Tech, I really have gotten into it recently due to my plan to get an engineering degree. So I hope that explains my story of why I pull for Tech and UGA \ud83d\ude05.\n\nNow with this information, I have a pretty funny story to tell you about the recent rivalry game. After the game, I forced my Uncle to go with me to the little \"spirit store\" inside the stadium gates. Now keep in mind, my Uncle and I are wearing Georgia head-to-toe(I had a Georgia hat, Georgia shirt, jacket, hoodie, chain, ring, sweatpants, AND slides \ud83d\ude02). I waited in line and everyone was staring at us, but when I asked,\"How much is the hoodie?\", every Tech and Georgia fan in like a 30 feet radius stopped in their tracks and the cashier said,\"Excuse me?\". Least to say I had a lot of weird looks. \ud83d\ude02",

Various shades of yellow have been used to approximate gold. Using an accent color allows you to use gold on parts of the uniform that are easier, e.g. helmet, numbers, piping, and have options other than solid white. The accent color changed from black to navy blue sometime in the 80s, but I don\u2019t know why.\n\nThe classic home uni to me is white jerseys, gold pants, gold helmet with solid white GT. This keeps the accent color to a minimum.\n\nOf course baseball and basketball uniforms are all fabric, so again the gold is tough. Those uniforms have always been white or relied heavily on the accent color.",

Both the old and the new band uniforms hold onto this tradition, as well as the Ramblin' Wreck mascot. Navy blue and variations of gray and silver have always been popular accent colors, though I think someone mentioned navy recently being elevated to an official color.\n\nThe yellow you are referring to is likely athletic gold, a popular alternative to regular gold for fabrics. I'm pretty sure Buzz both in the old logos and live at the games is black and athletic gold.",

Navy has pretty much always been there because of contrast issues. But I think it should always be minimized. The elephant in the room is that Buzz is yellow and black, so those colors get shoehorned in, but they suck. They only belong on logos and Buzz. Anyway it's weird.

Ik my opinion here is every unconventional, but I really liked it. Most of the problems people complained about on Ratemyprof came from the very format where 1,500 students are in it per 1 very busy prof and like 20 TAs, the lack of organization was very apparent and frustrating, but as a whole, it was interesting. Some homeworks had a max 2 submissions, but again, this was due to 1500 students overloading Gradescope, it wasn't inherent to the class or professor's desire to make your life miserable, it's because GA Tech can't hire enough people to teach CS 3600. I don't think they'll do it again bc now the class size is back to normal. Not all lectures were taught by Starner, but the ones he did were great. And he has such a wide background in all sorts of AI research that he offers insight that you usually wouldn't see in lectures. He also curved the grade so that median and higher is A, if I'm not mistaken (don't remember this one for sure).\n\nSome of the HWs had extra credit, and it was legitimately interesting. For example, for minimax there was a bot fight at a strategic game. Graphs had navigation in a real map of Atlanta with thousands of points. Also, some of these hws are good resume material.",

Is CS1301 python or Java?\n\nI don\u2019t have any programming experience, so would it be problematic for me to take the Java course before python?\n\nThank you.",

So to my understanding, I should be eligible for 50% of the Pell Grant (half-time enrollment). Anyone having the same issue? I am interning in the summer too so I can't push my classes to the summer.
