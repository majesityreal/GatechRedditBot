I contacted the insurance provider United Healthcare, and they informed me that pre-existing conditions like Crohn's Disease would be covered under this policy. I am currently on a regiment of Adalimumab injections (fortnightly) and Azathioprine tablets for maintaining my remission, and I wanted help on understanding the process of continuing my treatment here. \n\nI see that there is an option of Humira Copay where I can get my injection for 5$ a month, but I am unclear on how that process goes. Going through the highlights of the insurance plan, I saw that the Out of Pocket Maximum is $6,350 which I assume I would hit quite easily with the frequency of my biologicals, but even that much is a huge amount in medical fees every year.\n\nIs there anyone at Tech with Crohn's disease (or taking the same medication as me) who could guide me with the technicalities of the US Healthcare system? Help would be greatly appreciated. ",

After you pass Piedmont Ave you'll get a crossing to a two-way protected bike lane that will bring you alongside Piedmont Park until you hit the beltline.\n\nIf you bike on the road, just take the whole lane. The traffic isn't too fast in that section ^ because of all the lights\n\nIf you don't want to get on the road, it's technically illegal but it's sometimes safer to get on the sidewalk and go super slow, which I recommend if you're taking the 10th St route crossing the I-85 on-ramp going from campus to midtown. Public safety bikes will also ride on sidewalks so imo it's not a huge deal as long as you yield to pedestrians",

I am highly considering GaTech's co-op but was wondering if the fact that you are only allowed to work for one company actually be counter-productive since it seems to be risky and very hit or miss and I'm looking to gather as much experience as possible. Is it possible to work a fourth co-op term at a different company after completing the minimum 3 and are there any work arounds for switching co-op jobs if better offers are received. I really like the advantage of being able to work at different times of the year in co-op rather than only being limited to the summer and graduating in 5 years in not an issue for me. Additionally, I would like to know if getting internships and co-ops are hard to get in CS as an intl at Tech as well as if you can/should look for your own jobs outside of what is available on CareerBuzz ( haven't enrolled at Tech yet so unsure exactly of how it works). Lastly, can I expect the pay to be around $16 on the lower end for cs/swe jobs? Thanks so much in advance if you read this and feel free to pm me if you have any advice!",

Within Atlanta, you can expect at least $20/hr as a SWE intern. In west coast tech hubs, it'll be much more, depending on company. I know interns that make the annual equivalent of $120k which is $60/hr.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm currently facing a challenging situation and I'm reaching out for advice from anyone who has been through something similar or knows the steps I should take.\n\nI was recently informed by Georgia Tech's registrar's office that my Bachelor of Science degree from ETH Zurich doesn't meet their admission criteria for further study (after being admitted into graduate school ~3 month ago). They've stated that I need a \"4-year license or diploma\" from a Swiss institution. However, the Bachelor's degree program at ETH Zurich that I'm enrolled in spans only 3 years, adhering to the Bologna Process standardization. \n\nThis situation is particularly perplexing to me since I had assumed that a bachelor\u2019s degree from ETH Zurich would be sufficient for admission, especially considering that GT accepts 3-year Bachelor's degrees from Germany, which follows the same Bologna Process and that ETH's Bachelor degree is an internationally recognised BSc from a top tier university.\n\nAdding to the confusion, the \"license\" they refer to is typically awarded by vocational schools, and the \"diploma\" is a relic from before the Swiss education system adopted the Bologna system in 1999. ETH Zurich no longer awards these \"diplomas,\" and the standardized bachelor's degree program now is 3 years, not 4.\n\nHas anyone else encountered such an issue with the recognition (or lack thereof) of international degrees by US institutions? I could really use some advice on how to navigate this situation or suggestions on whom to contact within the academic administration to address my case.\n\nAny insights or guidance would be hugely appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

You're at the whims of the admin.\n\nKick up a small storm and see where it gets you. To be fair, the 3-year standard of many engineering universities in Europe is not exactly equivalent to a 4-year bachelor's in the US. That's why at ETHZ you're expected to pursue a Master's, while in the US it's the norm not to.\n\nMaybe see if you can find anyone who went to TU Delft and other similar universities, since they should be in the same situation.",

            "selftext": "I was admitted to the MS CS program, in Fall 2023. At that time, I was in a fairly comfortable position; working for two years as a software engineer since 2021, and both my parents were earning.\n\nMy mother unfortunately got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in May 2023, around the time I was preparing for my visa process. My father had to resign from his job to care for her, and I deferred my admission to Fall 2024 and continued working in India to be her secondary care giver. She ultimately passed away a few weeks ago.\n\nWe incurred tremendous medical expenses over the last year &amp; insurance barely covered anything. While I have some savings from my own, I cannot rely on my father for funding as he isn't earning right now. Getting a loan is also very hard right now due to lack of any earning co-signer, which is needed by most Indian banks.\n\nAs of now, I'm super confused regarding my MS plans. Gatech is my dream school and i was thrilled to have received an admit from a very competitive pool of candidates.\n\nWhile I understand that there are no outright scholarships for international students at Gatech, I'm wondering if it's possible to secure a GTA/GRA or any other paid work to support my degree. I am aware that we are not supposed to mail professors with unofficial emails (we won't get those before August), is there any way we can reach out right now ? Alternatively, would an online MS be a better option?",

Try going to Europe and Asia where the buildings and streets are much older and there\u2019s small steps and stones everywhere.

A deaf blind neurodivergent paraplegic person who only speaks K\u2019iche and has zero access to internet and caregivers? Who happens to visit GT to present on nuclear engineering? Your mentality of trying to accommodate for 100% of cases is why institutions and governments simply stop providing services for everyone. Because the threat and horror of only providing accommodations for 90% of people. Better 0% than 90%, okay. Cuz the only thing that will make you happy is zero bus service for everyone (equality/inclusion) or personalized mobility devices for everyone (also equity/inclusion). Let\u2019s just make all education virtual and simply shut down the campus. Because a select few people have difficulties with transportation or leaving the home.

I'm comparing the CITY of Atlanta to other CITIES. In Singapore, the ramps are about flush. The front door does not have a ramp bc it's only for entry so it's narrower by design so that the driver can check if people are tapping in. In Tokyo, the main avenues and forms of public transport are extremely accessible (more so than Atlanta, where the sidewalks are death traps for even normal pedestrians given how shit the local drivers are). Many new and administrative buildings are absolutely wheelchair accessible (key word being new, you can't necessarily expect a temple on the top of a hill to demolish its 500 year old historical staircase).\n\nAnd now, again, how did this comment address my points about seating for buses? The buses that largely have a narrow staircase to climb to access and are extremely inaccessible, forcing people who need accommodations to use alternative forms of transportation, often at their own great expense if they have to leave campus.\n\nYou have a huge problem with ignorance.

I'm sure that that blows your mind away, but it's the truth. Wait until you visit another developing nation and actually take public transport. \n\nAlso, purposefully misquoting people isn't a good look. Where did I say \"any\" developing nation? Please try actually reading comments before knee-jerking.\n\nI get the impression that you're the type of person to go club in Bali and then say that they traveled all around Indonesia.",

By the time I realized I had chosen poorly, the state patrol started closing exit ramps. So I couldn't escape at I-75N nor 17th/16th/14th. Now I was funneled into the connector gridlock street party. I eventually made it to the North Avenue exit ramp but was then stuck there for an hour. I had a tiny car, so I managed to hop the sidewalk adjacent to Smith dormitory, and drive backwards down the sidewalk. \n\nI had a wall on one side between me and the dorms, and power poles and a mailbox between me and the North Avenue/Williams Street ramp. So it took a hot minute but I backed down the sidewalk until I got to the Brittain service entrance, turned around, and then drove down Williams Street and onto campus. Once people saw what I had done, others followed behind. \n\nAnd that is how I liberated the North Avenue interstate ramp during Freaknik '94.",

This study is directed at college students (undergrad or grad) who are between the ages of 21 &amp; 30 (you do not necessarily need to attend GT). If you meet these criteria, please consider filling out a 5 minute survey at this link - [https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_3aDVErC4x3lHNMq](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3aDVErC4x3lHNMq). \n\nThere is no compensation other than my gratitude lol, but happy to fill out surveys or do a similar request if you DM me re: that.

Not to mention that I don't see myself going for any sort of administrative position.\n\nAre all engineers required to get a PE license, or is this actually a less traveled path than I think? For anyone who chose not to do it, how did that affect your career? And is there any advantage in working in more design based fields with a PE license?",

Also for some states you have to have a PE on staff to offer engineering services in that state. Some even break out SE and all other. Now, you could just hire out the stamping part.They're many companies out there that you can pay for their stamp, some shady. Again, I would tell anyone in the big 2 (CE and ME) to take their FE just cause it is easier right out of school. You got 4 years to decide on doing it.",

I dont think I have too many classes to take (and can actually get a decent bit of a headstart this summer) and the Job I'm trying to get is not as intensive plus pays well.\n\nI'm asking purely from a \"is this allowed standpoint\" than an \"is the workload okay\" standpoint - anyone know if CoC has ever allowed this or explicitly disallowed this?",

Regardless, it will be the same pay as a monthly GRA or GTA in the end; HR does that calculation. \n\nFor masters, I am not sure. Becky Wilson should be able to help you figure out the hourly pay but GTA as masters get paid around 1.2-1.3k per month, so I assume the total amount for 80 hours will be like that. But will you really do 20 hrs per week though? Remember you still have to CLOCK in hours if you are a GA and if you are a GTA, you don't need to clock in and you still get paid a monthly stipend.",

In my experience, very few people are super committed to the LLC project/theme (just the way life goes, not the fault of students or profs, but its a theme across majors/years/communities). That said, GC has a huge proportion of OOS/intl compared to the general population (can't speak to other LLCs). Choose whichever fits you best, getting close to profs is cool but its not a gigantic deal. Grand Challenges professors are always available so I wouldn't worry to much about that. Personally I thought the entrepreneurship aspect was cool; I haven't been super passionate about GC itself but the people I've met through it are truly phenomenal and the community itself outside of class is stellar.",

I do want to reiterate that I do not think it will make a big difference though, and the most important part is finding a strong sense of community, (which you can find through plenty of other ways such as clubs, housing, or classes on campus).",

Bits of Good is pleased to announce that with the Fall 2024 and Summer 2024 schedules being released, GT Scheduler is up and ready to help you prepare your schedules with the **new Compare Schedules feature**!\n\nWhile GT Scheduler was originally made so students could optimize the creation of their *own* class schedules, the Compare Schedules feature will now allow users to look at their friends\u2019 schedules from within the GT Scheduler site! Once logged in with a schedule already made, click the \u201cShare Schedule\u201d button located on the right and share your schedule(s) with others by entering their email or copying the link. Email invites will appear in their inbox once sent. On the right panel, turn on the \u201cCompare Schedule\u201d switch and click on your friend\u2019s schedules to compare! Note that this feature **does not work on mobile**.\n\nGT Scheduler has also opened a **donation portal**! In light of growing engineering costs, we are asking for the help of our users to keep GT Scheduler running! These donations will enable us to continue refining our services and providing students with these tools and new features. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a **significant** difference in our ability to maintain and improve GT Scheduler. We at Bits of Good want to thank the GT community for using and supporting our work, and we can\u2019t wait to see how the future of this amazing website unfolds. Happy scheduling!  \n[https://www.gt-scheduler.org/](https://www.gt-scheduler.org/)  \n[https://donorbox.org/gt-scheduler](https://donorbox.org/gt-scheduler)",

Not going to name-drop, but anybody in ECE is going to know who I\u2019m talking about. \n\nThis is a lecturer who registers their courses as in-person and pulls away once everybody is registered and class has started and moves class into \u201cremote,\u201d which is really just prerecorded sessions. (They have done this multiple times, not just this semester)\n\nNot only this, but what is effectively a youtube video and some scribbles of notes every week are mind-numbingly simple for a class that is supposed to be advanced and extremely important to the field of study. \n\nFor the hard part, the simple and logical solution is to go talk to the dean about this. But that is not a good idea as this lecturer is\u2026 close to the dean.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, half of the people in the class are happy about the free A, but I went into this class excited to learn about the subject I want to dedicate my career to. I feel like I\u2019m falling behind everybody else in the field, as the shit we do in this class is just basic circuit analysis that any first semester freshman in ECE can do in their sleep.\n\nIt already doesn\u2019t help that I was promised, and paid massive amounts of money, to take an in person class because I struggle to pay attention in an online format, but even if I do pay attention all I see is RC circuits and plug-and-chug equations.\n\nThis \u201cworld class\u201d engineering program can sometimes be an absolute joke, and it\u2019s obvious that some lectures should not be employed here.\n",

On day 1, the prof said that 3043 was your chance to learn circuits again and that's exactly what I did and passed an interview with TI a few weeks later.~~ The class, however, is not very advanced. Many who go deeper into the field view it more as a hurdle to get to the real classes. There are better professors that are teaching the advanced classes in the field. The people I know who are pursuing it as a career will say that interning experience is what actually that propelled them to be successful. The class in question just an unfortunate hurdle that everyone kind of needs to take at the moment. If you want someone to vent or discuss this with my DMs are open. But, I the situation isn't going to really change anytime soon.",

It is the definition of conflict of interest.\n\nI always read reddit but never commented until I saw this. I really feel you. I took her class during covid. Never opened her camera once. The classes comprised of her reading her lecture notes WORD FOR WORD. And she posted these lecture notes on canvas later. Exams are exactly similar to her examples on these notes. All of the classes she teach are either like this OR magically they're taught by this other professor she is related to (not hard to guess for ECEs). So, you end up learning nothing and getting a free A. During my entire 5 years at ECE, I never seen her in real life. She is just a robotic voice for me.\n\nThe problem is she always gets the best reviews on every platform (ratemyprof, CIOS, you name it) because people like 1 - their free As  2 - she is very nice to the point that there is zero rigor in the class. Again, she is a nice person, but a horrible college professor in my opinion. So if you look at metrics, GT sees no problem. To your comment of \" and it\u2019s obvious that some lectures should not be employed here,\" it's common for husband and wive duos to be hired by the same university. So maybe it was a BOGO deal in a way (again, just my theory, i obviously don't have any proof)\n\nIf there is any ECE freshmand/sophmore who is reading this - Please avoid her for anything (circuit analysis, VLSI, etc.) at all costs. Unless you have this silly challenge to try to keep your 4.0 from becoming 3.999 (nobody cares - you'll get a job if you're a good engineer not because you got an A in every course you had), you'll absolutely learn zero thing in her classes. There are 10 minute youtube videos that will educate you more than her entire semester of circuit analysis course.\n\nThere are great professors in ECE that will inspire you and remind you why you actually chose engineering in the first place. They're very rare. However, it is rewarding to find the courses that they teach. Please go find them.",

                    "body": "Hey, BS/MS ME here! I went through this last year so I know how it goes\n\nFirst off, if you\u2019re graduating undergrad this semester, know that you can\u2019t register for grad classes until Phase II registration, since you\u2019re a \u201cnew\u201d student again. That means that you\u2019ll have plenty of time to figure out what\u2019s available and what\u2019s filled up. \n\nSecond, if you\u2019re registering as an undergrad, you\u2019ll need level permits to actually be able to register for grad classes. I believe that also opens during Phase II, so you can try to request overrides in advance but they may tell you to wait\n\nLastly, your actual question. I didn\u2019t really struggle getting into any major area classes except for one, but it opened up within the first week of class. Just like undergrad, people will drop classes within the first week of registration and you\u2019ve got a decent chance of getting in. As an undergrad I went for ME 6104 during my last semester and got in just fine\n\nBy the way, not sure how you\u2019re planning your grad school credit hours, but 9 credits in a semester is enough to fill up your time. I did 12 last semester and it took over time from my extra curriculars, so spread it out as much as you can",

You should probably do a little bit of review of some basic calculations like determinants, row reductions, and how to find a basis for Null Space, Column Space, and Row space. \n\nI've seen that most people struggle with 1554 because of the time required inside and outside of class, and also the exams sometimes being tough.\n\nFor 3406, Loss uses Gilbert Strang's book, \"Introduction to Linear Algebra.\" (He uses 6th edition but you can find the 4th and 5th editions online for free -- The content is mostly the same). The best thing about the book is that it has an entire lecture video series on YouTube by MIT Open Courseware. The lecture series playlist is called \"MIT 18.06SC Linear Algebra, Fall 2011.\"\n\nLoss is an amazing professor and breaks down the content with helpful visualizations. I strongly recommend taking 3406 with him. Homework assignments were given every 1 or 2 weeks and were not time-consuming. His exams were quite similar to the practice exams, and were fair if you went to lecture and did the homework.",

I'm currently taking Chemistry at a community college near my university to fulfill that requirement for computer engineering in fact. \n\nPhysics 1 will count as your lab science elective. \n\nSo because they don't care about +s and -s, only A, B, C, it is a bit hard to get that 3.3 right. To be safe, you'll want at least 2 As and 2 Bs for a solid math/science GPA of 3.5. If you just take Calc 1, 2, and physics then you'll need just 1 A and 2 Bs, it's not too difficult to calculate. \n\nI had a perfect gpa last semester, taking writing, anthropology, calc 2, and two CompSci classes. This semester I have a B in CompSci, and close As in writing 2, calc 3, physics 1, and chemistry.\n\nSo because I got an A in calc 2 last semester, I need at least an A and 2 Bs in calc 3, physics, and chem.\n\nThis is actually making me nervous as well, because they are quite close As and I'm considering dropping Calc 3 because of this so I can get a B in physics and a B in chem and be fine no risks.\n\nAll this to say, the stress never stops lol\n\nBut I think you'll be fine as a math major, dedicate all your time to calc 1 and 2 and physics. Other classes should be less priority but don't let any easy As become Bs. \n\n  \nDid that all make sense or do you need some clarification? I just kind of ranted on and on my fault",

I heard an amazing professor who is a legend in Tapeout joined recently.\n* UT Austin - Very affordable tuition fees, access to Teaching Assistantships. Austin is the hub of most semiconductor companies. Good in Digital Physical Design and has access to a large variety of courses.\n\nWhich will be a better school for transitioning to the industry?",

There's very little to no guarantee for most people on which class they TA for even if the professor asks for them (there are some exceptions, but generally this is true).",

However, there don't seem many study-abroad opportunities even outside of South Korea for BME students. I wanted to take advantage of the study abroad opportunity, while I still had core classes to take because it would have been easier to transfer those credits. However, now that I've finished all my core classes, I only have BME-specific classes which makes me think I'll have a harder time transferring credits.  Is anyone a BME student who studied abroad after taking all of your core classes? For context, I'll be finishing my second year this Spring. ",

The inspector canceled and rescheduled with us three times over the course of a few months. They finally came and started their inspections shortly after your post and after many of the certs had expired. It took them a few weeks to complete the initial inspections across campus, and they now need to return to complete follow-up inspections (for example, elevators that were out of order during the initial visit).",

This parking lot is planned to be replaced with several academic infill buildings (which even have renders) and there are plans to extend state street down to tech parkway through where the Ferst center currently stands as a bus-only cut-through of the campus core (don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re planning on rebuilding it in the new arts district). I think the read is fascinating and shows how much thought the campus has put until future planning.\u00a0",

Overall I like the direction that the campus is moving, but I do have some concerns regarding that plan. For example, I don't know why they are replacing Peter's parking deck, since to me that was one of the best examples of a good parking deck, with tennis/basketball courts on top of it. I'm also a little concerned with enrollment projection, since tech is already increasing enrollment too fast. I hope they can slow down the rate that the enrollment is increasing and do more improvements on the facilities first.",

Certainly also most of what I described could be done in much less space, though I will note part of why the auto show has moved is because of parking lots being removed. I would guess it could be held on the top of one of the decks though so not a hard fix. Biggest question for me is access to the buildings for equipment moving, as I noted in another comment the lathes and water jet and other things in the Invention Studio and Machining Mall were delivered on large trucks and required heavy equipment to move them. There will be tradeoffs with any plans but looks like GT has been looking at building in this area already so they've probably thought about it pretty thoroughly. More housing and classroom space is needed with enrollment increasing.",

And, if you look back historically to changes that have happened on the campus over the decades, it is clearly trending in a clear direction (like, Tech Green used to be a parking lot. Can you imagine going back to that). So, the leadership of the institute have a clear intent to make more efficient use of space on the campus and want to axe surface lots where possible. \n\nI would say to not be sad about this, but take the bright side and view it as possible room for growth. These lots is as a readily available space to expand when the needs and resources available arise, and the history shows that GT\u2019s leadership is more than open to replacing surface parking lots with new development. As GT continues to grow they can utilize that area to build more of whatever is most pressing (labs, dorms, classrooms, etc).",

I'd be very curious as to the number of parking spots the GT had back in those days vs presently. Tbh I wouldn't be surprised if there are more parking spots now then there were back then. \n\nIn addition we are continuing to grow the number of students and the facilities available on campus.

Go on Historic Aerials or use Google Earth and you'll see a surprising number of large lots that are no longer there across campus.\n\n&gt; Flat lots are just... Not space efficient or good uses of land... From like $/sq ft usage. Sorry if you feel otherwise.\n\nI am not claiming they're space-efficient, and \"good\" is a value judgement.  Overall, I think parking lots are way-overbuilt and have unacceptably low average usage rates across the country and especially metro Atlanta, but *not* at GT.  I am simply against the \"fewer/no cars\" mindset when no pragmatic tradeoffs are offered.  As I said, those folks will never be satisfied by any level of reduction until it's utterly complete.",

This is a living document that's been around since like the 1910s. \n\nIn 2002 the Campus Master Plan states there were 9744 parking spaces. In 2023 the Campus Master Plan states there were 13256 parking spaces. I'm unable to locate the 1997, 1991 or earlier CMPs online tho they are available through GTs archives. \n\n&gt;No pragmatic tradeoffs\n\nThese documents have literally pages dedicated to talking about the strategic plans for parking and why certain decisions are desired. For example - the reduction of surface lots is largely tied to the simple fact that Fulton county (like many cities) have established taxes/fees associated with the amount of sq ft. of impermeable land (including parking lots) that is owned by an organization. This fee is driven by the fact that we use a combined storm water/sanitary sewer system and it is simply becoming overwhelmed. To fix this we needed to raise funds to build a better system/work to reduce the amount of water run off. Hence the tax. These decisions by tech is to... Save money by reducing our tax liability. \n\n&gt;Until it's utterly complete\n\nWhile there may be some folks that believe this. I think your lumping of all folks who desire a reduction of cars/parking spaces into one monolith is both reductive and unsubstantiated. Do better.",

The premise of someone calling parking \"storage\" is that it should be done away with for more immediate use.

I've done research and found that HP students live in seperate dorms and have seperate classes with a small number of students. Will this limit the amount of friends you can make and make your college life bland and boring?\nAlso, I found that the hefner-armstrong dorms have community bathrooms. Is this true for all dorms at Georgia Tech or is it just for these dorms. I really would want to have a dorm with which the bathroom is connected and is just for the use of my roommate and I. \nLastly, I want to ask whether the HP is only for first year students or if it lasts for all 4 years. If it lasts for all 4 years then is it possible to change your dorm building after the first year?\nI know my questions might seem a little dumb but I am an international student who's never visited Georgia or GeorgiaTech so some help would be greatly appreciated. See you all there!",

                    "body": "Hi, HP student here! TLDR: The honors program is worth it and I highly recommend. \n\nTo answer your questions in more details: \n\n1) We all live in Eighth St. Apartments. Freshmen used to live in Hefner-Armstrong, but now everyone lives across the street in 2, 4, or 6 person apartments where everyone gets their own room and there is a bathroom for every pair of two roommates (eg. the 6 person apartments have 3 bathrooms). The dorm style living spaces (which most freshmen live in) do have community bathrooms. I personally think that dorm style living spaces are better for freshmen to meet new people, but you won't be in the honors program and you will have to deal with community bathrooms in those.\n\n2) The honors program classes are optional and the vast majority of the classes we take are not honors program ones. It is cool to have access to that extra resource, but it really doesn't limit us in getting to know more people.\n\n3) You can meet tons of people through events and clubs on campus as well as through housing. There are tons of clubs that are super tight knit and will help you have a vibrant social life. There are hundreds of students in the honors program (roughly 200 a year), and that is where I have met many of my best friends. In my experience, the people I have met through HP have made my college experience far more exciting and you dont need to worry about HP making it bland.\n\n4) The honors program does last for all four years. In the past, students had the option to move elsewhere on campus and stay in the honors program, but now if you want to live on campus and remain in the honors program you have to live in Eighth St. You can still live elsewhere on campus in future years but you would have to leave HP to do so. You can always live off campus in the future and remain in the honors program. As you will find out when you come here, it is really hard to get on campus housing as an upper year. The honors program makes it MUCH easier to get on- campus housing.\n\n5) Other things of note: The honors program isn't perfect. The housing is a HUGE part of the benefit of the program, but you do have to live on West campus. I prefer West to East, but many people who want more parties prefer East. Also, if you are a business or LMC major, most of your classes will be a pretty far walk from West campus. Finally, companies I have worked for have liked seeing the honors program on my resume.",

However, I did find myself increasingly drawn to the realm of website and application design as I take other classes. This shift in interests has led me to consider transitioning to the LMC major. Plus, I thought actively participating in clubs like the Design Club or WebDev Club may be more fun and offer me more practical experience compared to continuing with my CS classes. I was contemplating switching to industrial design, but considering graduating a year late and being unable to study abroad at my desired university makes me hesitant to pursue this route. However, I\u2019m considering to minor in it if I switch majors.\n\nNow the main issue I'm grappling with is uncertainty regarding whether obtaining a degree in LMC will notably enhance my chances of success in my future career. May sound like a nonsense but I'm worried how potentialemployers would view me as an LMC major pursuing opportunities in UI design (main) or Web Design\u2026 I feel like they will want more to people with ID/CM degree than a person with LMC degree\u2026 Am I just overthinking too much.?\n\nWill sticking with CM be better or switching to LMC and minoring in Industrial Design would be better and more helpful for UI designer??",

If you enjoy UI/UX then I think you should stay. Data structures is not the end all class. It is something you should get the basics of but it isn\u2019t gonna define ur career. You could totally do a minor if ur interested in UX writing. I think they combine well",

I've worked as a programmer, a QA analyst, did some non-major related work for a few years, and now I've worked as a product manager at my current company for about 4 years. I have objectively been a high performer at every single one of those positions, and I was straight up not a great student. No 4.0 semesters for me, and I had to take more than a couple of classes more than once. Data Structures...let's just say I became VERY familiar with the coursework of that class.\n\nDid that lock me out of a particular set of companies coming right out of college? Yeah, but unless you want to code in isolation all day or get paid the absolute maximum amount of money straight from the start, in hindsight that was a perfectly fine tradeoff for me.\n\nThe question \"What will my employer think of this degree vs CS\" was one that I was also constantly thinking about while going through the coursework. The answer is not a damn thing. Every school has its own little nomenclature for degrees and employers aren't bothered to care about the distinction. They care about the name Georgia Tech.\n\nHonestly, you are going to be 10x more competent than a CS major from 85% of the other schools you're likely to work alongside. Georgia Tech does an amazing job of making you a competent and thoughtful programmer.\n\nIf you love your LMC coursework including the tech-based classes and struggle a little bit with the CS courses, then I would say that you are in the exact right major.\n\nWhat I think I gained from going through the program that my CS brother and sisters do not is what I would call an actual well rounded education.\n\nI am both very technically proficient and also developed great interpersonal and communication skills that I think have done more to get me promoted and raises than any code I could have written.",

You're definitely right to overthink when it comes to this type of topic, but as an LMC major who is doing uiux design and got an internship this summer for design at a relatively well known company, I'd say lmc is not as bad as you think it might be :)\n\nI was a computer science major for my first year and I ended up fully hating it. But ux doesn't *require* coding knowledge so I switched out. But if you want to go into webdev, I'd suggest maybe staying a Cm major. I don't know anything about what goes on in coding classes, but from what everyone else is saying you don't need to be amazing in your cs classes.\n\nI've talked to many advisors recruiters and professionals in the ux design industry and many of them agree that your degree/major is not going to make or break your application. Your projects and portfolio will. This is why participating in clubs that have design positions could help you too.  \n\nFeel free to pm/dm me if you have any questions! I'd be happy to answer them",

I personally love my CM track (media-interaction design) because it's coding with applications in the design part that I'm most interested in. But at the end of the day, your degree is your degree (and time and money etc.) so do what will please you the most and remember that the best degree is any GT degree, so you really can't go wrong!",

I think a lot of people consider CS1332 to be one of the harder CS courses (save for 4000-level Networking courses or whatever). I think if you can make it through Data Structures, then you'll be fine. Also, I know several software engineers @ FAANG who have retaken 1332, so you'll probably be fine especially since you want to do UI (UX?) design which doesn't even use data structures.\n2. Plenty of people in the industry aren't CM/ID majors/equivalent. More design-focused majors will give you an advantage in having more projects/coursework that work with design for your portfolio. On the other hand, having a coding background definitely gives you an edge over other candidates because recruiters like to see that you can communicate effectively with the developers on your team. CM is nice because you get 1 thread LMC and 1 thread CS, so it's kind of the best of both worlds. Feel free to minor in ID if you have extra time in your graduation schedule but I don't think it'll make or break anything.\n3. Definitely continue attending Design Club, GT Webdev, etc. Clubs are a great way to gain experience and network. Especially for internships, it shows passion (where you will lack industry experience). Clubs also work on cool projects that you can use for your portfolio. They're also just a great learning resource because IMO there aren't a lot of courses that will help you learn UX (at least when I was a student).",

The fact that she knows a little about the process of turning a Figma design into a working front end website is helpful.

Also, are the cameras in your bedroom or just the common area?",

I'm planning on majoring in mechanical engineering.\n\nFor Vanderbilt, I have received a scholarship that covers my tuition. I also got the Davis scholarship at Columbia which would cover about 50k. I haven't received my financial aid package from Georgia Tech or Duke. I have toured Columbia and Georgia Tech and loved both campuses. I plan on visiting Vanderbilt and Duke in next few weeks. I am currently leaning towards Georgia Tech(#5) and Columbia(#17) because they're the better engineering schools according to US News Rankings. I am still open towards Duke and Vanderbilt. Duke (#22) it is well known and has a strong engineering program. Vanderbilt(#42) isn't as good for engineering but it has a good reputation. Is Georgia Tech's engineering education significantly better because of the ranking difference or are top 20 schools about the same? I also wish to know their rankings for mechanical engineering.\n\nI feel like Georgia Tech will prepare me better for engineering but Columbia will have more career opportunities because it's an Ivy and it's in New York. I like Atlanta more than New York but I'm fine with living in New York. I would prefer to have a STEM heavy course load which Georgia Tech has. Columbia would be less STEM heavy because of the \"Core Curriculum\". My main concern is which school will help me get the best/most engineering job offers. The community and environment is another important factor for me. What other factors should I consider?\n\nI appreciate any advice! Thanks!",

GT is top 10 in most engineering fields. Columbia being in NY won't necessarily help with job opportunities in mechanical engineering. \n\nThe *real* question comes down to financial aid. If you're not from GA and you don't have a major scholarship in hand already, you will not get good aid from Tech and you should consider another school. A top school is not worth six figure debt.",

So if you are worried about the tuition and fees there is a realistic chance of getting funding.\n\nHowever, as I said before, I know where you're coming from as I myself am trying elentlessely to find an advisor for funding. One piece of information is that professors keep getting projects round the year. The professor you're trying to work with may not have a project right now but may get a project later(maybe in may, jun(maybe). The idea or the strategy is to be persistent! Keep trying, be courteous when asking for an opportunity. I have met some people who managed to get funding before going to the campus, so just hang in there tight!",

My current school, UVA, has a very small MSE program (only 8 total MSE majors in the class of 2027) but the upside is that it is very easy to get research opportunities. If I transfer to GT, I would be paying \\~3K more a year, but I would be able to take more in-depth classes for a biomaterials concentration, and Atlanta is a better location than Charlottesville for job opportunities and internships. MSE is also relatively small at GT, so I'm assuming that it won't be impossible to get research opportunities. Would it be worth it to transfer?",

This does not mean that I am not willing to work hard but I would like to know if the co-op is really worth it or are the stats just inflated by the top performers at UW (silicon valley jobs etc). Is it viable to use UW as a pipeline to jobs in silicon valley as an intl (non-US)? Does working/studying non-stop with basically nothing except winter break kill your uni experience? Is uoft's asip program really that bad and how hard is it to be internship-hunting in Canada on your own (without doing co-op or help from the university board). Lastly, is GTech with co-op a better option for me, especially to get high-paying swe jobs post-grad or is UW co-op going to be significantly better for both Canada and US jobs? Thanks in advance if you read this!\n\nFor more context towards a balanced life and cost: GTech is the cheapest. I have more friends studying in the toronto area than waterloo or atlanta. Atlanta is closest to my home country so its's the fastest and cheapest flight. I have never been to any of these places so I'm not sure where will be the best to spend my undergrad.",

One of my worse grades at GT. If you're Intel thread, don't be like me; attend lecture and you'll be fine.\u00a0\n\n\nCS 2050 - ironically enough one of my favorite classes at GT CS classes. Ronnie Howard is goated. Definitely a lot of work but if you camp office hours and take advantage of TAs, getting an A probably won't be too hard.\n\n\nCS 2340 - this class is a joke but an easy A. They improved it this semester but I wish they'd just throw it out entirely and replace it with a 2000 level web or mobile dev class where we're taught development as a focus and object-oriented design/analysis as an aside (semester project has been a JAVAFX app, Android app, and I think now website?) Seems to just test on memorization.\n\n\nCS 2110- another favorite of mine. Learned about circuits, gates, Assembly (not a useful type), C, etc. There's some overlap with 2050 in terms of truth tables, De Morgan's, and what not. I don't think it was particularly hard but I know some people struggle with the class. Think it's way easier compared to implementing and understanding a bunch of algos in AI though.",

Would've preferred a 2000 level mobile app class with some OO-oriented design/analysis aspects over CS 2340 (where the OO-oriented design/analysis is the focus and the semester project you have to essentially self-learn).",

I'm technically waiting to hear back from one last interview, and there are two or three more postings I could apply to, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\nThe only real experience I have related to my major is research, which I'm doing this semester and will (likely) be doing over the summer. I'm worried about whether this is enough for when I start applying to full-time positions. Any advice?\n\nEdit: The day after I posted this, I got an offer from my dream company \ud83d\ude4f",

Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of companies that either do nuclear work or operate reactors, so that really tends to be the limiting factor. Adjacent work may help you get your foot in the door for the job that you actually want come graduation. I was able to get my foot in the door with a company through internships in adjacent works to get a job offer in the nuclear space. \n\n  \nYou'll land on your feet, you don't have anything to worry about. I have had several friends that I've graduated with that didn't have internships that got jobs right out of graduation, including in the nuclear world. Just come prepared to interviews with technical examples of how you solved problems (you can get this from your research experience) and you'll be in good shape!",

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm Will.  I'm currently serving as a Senator in the Graduate Student Senate.\n\nAs many of you are aware, SGA has been working to improve our RSO funding policies.  Today, a 72 page document was introduced to the Senate containing many proposed amendments.  I've attached the full document here:\n\n[SGA's Proposed RSO Funding Policy Amendments](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/GeorgiaTechSGA/Ec6M58-7PcNMmRrjr09-ZYABq2746M5t_oH74zlx1uj0Tw?e=3TeoSY)\n\nI specifically would like to call your attention to the proposed amendments in Section 9.6, which **introduces hard caps on the total funding any one RSO could receive in a fiscal year**, Section 14.5, which **allows SGA to retroactively revoke funding that has already been allocated to an RSO**, and Section 4.2.5, which sets aside $75,000 for \"Campus Maintenance and Development\", thereby **reducing the funding available for RSOs**.\n\nThere are many other proposed amendments in the document.  Some (in my opinion) are good, some (in my opinion) are bad, and some are relatively mundane.  I encourage you to read the proposals yourself and come to your own conclusions.\n\nIf you are passionate about RSO funding, I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the proposals under consideration and make your voice heard.  **You can voice your opinion to the Undergraduate House of Representatives tomorrow (April 2) at 7:30 PM in Smithgall 117 (Flag Building).**  Likewise, **you can voice your opinion to the Graduate Student Senate next Monday (April 8) at 11:00 AM in Clary Theater (Bill Moore Success Center).**\n\nOne final note, I know many of the folks who have been involved with developing these amendments.  I KNOW that they are good, well-intentioned people trying to make a bad situation better.  A policy of this magnitude deserves scrutiny and passionate debate.  I am hopeful that any discussions generated by this post remain focused on the policy itself, and not the people involved with trying to fix it.",

                            "body": "This is a vast simplification of the issue, but essentially in 2020 Georgia Tech's lawyers rewrote the SAF funding policies, and removed the ability for SGA to have any discretion over funding decisions.  Every year, many RSOs apply for a budget through SGA.  Under the revised policy, if the total amount of funding requested exceeded the total amount of funding available, all budgets would be cut by a uniform percent such that SGA didn't allocate more money than was available.  Then Covid happened, and RSOs generally weren't requesting funding through SGA anyway, so the SAF reserves grew abnormally large and in the years following covid RSOs grew accustomed to SGA having virtually unlimited funding to distribute.  SGA burned through it's reserves pretty quickly, because under the new policy it literally did not have the authority to deny funding requests if funding was available (and the request complied with RSO policy).  The issue here is that there was nothing stopping an RSO from submitting a request for several hundred thousand dollars (which would never get funded at any other university) and forcing SGA to cut the budgets of all other RSOs to accommodate the exorbitant requests.  This came to a head this year, when the funding requested was more than double the funding available, and therefore all RSOs were looking at over a 50% budget cut.  To help insulate smaller RSOs that are relatively less able to solicit external funding, SGA amended its budget cut formulas to a bracket system, where the portion of a budget request below a certain threshold was reduced at a smaller rate than the portion of a budget request above a certain threshold.  This was viewed by some as \"absolutely shafting\" some large RSOs, but we we're all shafted regardless.",

Recently the lawyers have agreed to be removed from the process, hence the flurry of proposed amendments seen here.",

For a little bit of background, Georgia Tech (and I believe all other USG schools) has a Mandatory Student Fee Advisory Committee (MSFAC).  There are four undergrads, four grad students, and four admin folks that have a vote on the committee.  Every year (except for this year), MSFAC votes to set the level of each mandatory student fee.  Officially, this vote is a \"recommendation\" that is presented to President Cabrera, but in my experience President Cabrera legitimately values student input and, to my knowledge, has always accepted the recommendation of MSFAC.  At that point, President Cabrera officially submits the proposed fee rates to USG, and USG has the final authority to approve or deny the proposed fee rates.  However this year USG threw all of this out the window and mandated that all student fees be recalculated as if part time students paid fees at half the rate of full time students, and online students paid fees at one quarter the full time rate.  MSFAC was told by USG to not request any fee increases this year.  USG is going to look at what the new fees would be under that new system, and vote on potentially moving to something like that, which would shake up the fee level anyone pays.  TL:DR, nobody knows what's happening with fees this year",

And it's a good idea to [register your bike](https://police.gatech.edu/bicycles-campus) with GTPD in case it needs to be removed for some reason (only lock to racks, not trees, railings, etc.) or get stolen, so they can track you down if they find it.

I'm not sure the best way to send it to me, but if you pm me, I'll provide my email and maybe I can download it from there. Otherwise, you could comment or pm a link to the video via YouTube or Google Drive.\n\nThis will be used in a public YouTube video, so please be aware of that before sending me something you might not want out there. I'm also happy to credit you if you'd like.\n\nAlso... does anyone happen to know where I can find a higher quality version of this video of Brent Key following the 2022 Duke win?

I would suggest tho what the top comment says if u don\u2019t want to spend too much. I\u2019ve seen some hella good hair done by students and it\u2019s p cheap.\n\nAs for performing your normal routine before, it really depends on who is cutting it. I\u2019ve had ppl ask me to not wash it directly before so they can see it\u2019s natural state, or to wash it before bc they r more comfortable with freshly washed hair (like washes 30 mins b4). The consensus seems to be wash b4 although if u regularly see a specific person, ask them. Communication with the stylist is key",

I contacted the insurance provider United Healthcare, and they informed me that pre-existing conditions like Crohn's Disease would be covered under this policy. I am currently on a regiment of Adalimumab injections (fortnightly) and Azathioprine tablets for maintaining my remission, and I wanted help on understanding the process of continuing my treatment here. \n\nI see that there is an option of Humira Copay where I can get my injection for 5$ a month, but I am unclear on how that process goes. Going through the highlights of the insurance plan, I saw that the Out of Pocket Maximum is $6,350 which I assume I would hit quite easily with the frequency of my biologicals, but even that much is a huge amount in medical fees every year.\n\nIs there anyone at Tech with Crohn's disease (or taking the same medication as me) who could guide me with the technicalities of the US Healthcare system? Help would be greatly appreciated. ",

I worked multiple jobs every single semester to ensure that I would be graduating debt free. My parents did not save a single dime for me or any of my siblings to go to school. So in my opinion, my tax return is 100% mine. \n\nI\u2019m just curious if anyone else sends a portion of their tax return to their parents or if your parents require you to?",

After you pass Piedmont Ave you'll get a crossing to a two-way protected bike lane that will bring you alongside Piedmont Park until you hit the beltline.\n\nIf you bike on the road, just take the whole lane. The traffic isn't too fast in that section ^ because of all the lights\n\nIf you don't want to get on the road, it's technically illegal but it's sometimes safer to get on the sidewalk and go super slow, which I recommend if you're taking the 10th St route crossing the I-85 on-ramp going from campus to midtown. Public safety bikes will also ride on sidewalks so imo it's not a huge deal as long as you yield to pedestrians",

I am highly considering GaTech's co-op but was wondering if the fact that you are only allowed to work for one company actually be counter-productive since it seems to be risky and very hit or miss and I'm looking to gather as much experience as possible. Is it possible to work a fourth co-op term at a different company after completing the minimum 3 and are there any work arounds for switching co-op jobs if better offers are received. I really like the advantage of being able to work at different times of the year in co-op rather than only being limited to the summer and graduating in 5 years in not an issue for me. Additionally, I would like to know if getting internships and co-ops are hard to get in CS as an intl at Tech as well as if you can/should look for your own jobs outside of what is available on CareerBuzz ( haven't enrolled at Tech yet so unsure exactly of how it works). Lastly, can I expect the pay to be around $16 on the lower end for cs/swe jobs? Thanks so much in advance if you read this and feel free to pm me if you have any advice!",

Within Atlanta, you can expect at least $20/hr as a SWE intern. In west coast tech hubs, it'll be much more, depending on company. I know interns that make the annual equivalent of $120k which is $60/hr.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm currently facing a challenging situation and I'm reaching out for advice from anyone who has been through something similar or knows the steps I should take.\n\nI was recently informed by Georgia Tech's registrar's office that my Bachelor of Science degree from ETH Zurich doesn't meet their admission criteria for further study (after being admitted into graduate school ~3 month ago). They've stated that I need a \"4-year license or diploma\" from a Swiss institution. However, the Bachelor's degree program at ETH Zurich that I'm enrolled in spans only 3 years, adhering to the Bologna Process standardization. \n\nThis situation is particularly perplexing to me since I had assumed that a bachelor\u2019s degree from ETH Zurich would be sufficient for admission, especially considering that GT accepts 3-year Bachelor's degrees from Germany, which follows the same Bologna Process and that ETH's Bachelor degree is an internationally recognised BSc from a top tier university.\n\nAdding to the confusion, the \"license\" they refer to is typically awarded by vocational schools, and the \"diploma\" is a relic from before the Swiss education system adopted the Bologna system in 1999. ETH Zurich no longer awards these \"diplomas,\" and the standardized bachelor's degree program now is 3 years, not 4.\n\nHas anyone else encountered such an issue with the recognition (or lack thereof) of international degrees by US institutions? I could really use some advice on how to navigate this situation or suggestions on whom to contact within the academic administration to address my case.\n\nAny insights or guidance would be hugely appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

At that time, I was in a fairly comfortable position; working for two years as a software engineer since 2021, and both my parents were earning.\n\nMy mother unfortunately got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in May 2023, around the time I was preparing for my visa process. My father had to resign from his job to care for her, and I deferred my admission to Fall 2024 and continued working in India to be her secondary care giver. She ultimately passed away a few weeks ago.\n\nWe incurred tremendous medical expenses over the last year &amp; insurance barely covered anything. While I have some savings from my own, I cannot rely on my father for funding as he isn't earning right now. Getting a loan is also very hard right now due to lack of any earning co-signer, which is needed by most Indian banks.\n\nAs of now, I'm super confused regarding my MS plans. Gatech is my dream school and i was thrilled to have received an admit from a very competitive pool of candidates.\n\nWhile I understand that there are no outright scholarships for international students at Gatech, I'm wondering if it's possible to secure a GTA/GRA or any other paid work to support my degree. I am aware that we are not supposed to mail professors with unofficial emails (we won't get those before August), is there any way we can reach out right now ? Alternatively, would an online MS be a better option?",

Because the threat and horror of only providing accommodations for 90% of people. Better 0% than 90%, okay. Cuz the only thing that will make you happy is zero bus service for everyone (equality/inclusion) or personalized mobility devices for everyone (also equity/inclusion).

In Tokyo, the main avenues and forms of public transport are extremely accessible (more so than Atlanta, where the sidewalks are death traps for even normal pedestrians given how shit the local drivers are). Many new and administrative buildings are absolutely wheelchair accessible (key word being new, you can't necessarily expect a temple on the top of a hill to demolish its 500 year old historical staircase).\n\nAnd now, again, how did this comment address my points about seating for buses?

I eventually made it to the North Avenue exit ramp but was then stuck there for an hour. I had a tiny car, so I managed to hop the sidewalk adjacent to Smith dormitory, and drive backwards down the sidewalk. \n\nI had a wall on one side between me and the dorms, and power poles and a mailbox between me and the North Avenue/Williams Street ramp. So it took a hot minute but I backed down the sidewalk until I got to the Brittain service entrance, turned around, and then drove down Williams Street and onto campus. Once people saw what I had done, others followed behind. \n\nAnd that is how I liberated the North Avenue interstate ramp during Freaknik '94.",

Not to mention that I don't see myself going for any sort of administrative position.\n\nAre all engineers required to get a PE license, or is this actually a less traveled path than I think?

Also for some states you have to have a PE on staff to offer engineering services in that state. Some even break out SE and all other. Now, you could just hire out the stamping part.They're many companies out there that you can pay for their stamp, some shady. Again, I would tell anyone in the big 2 (CE and ME) to take their FE just cause it is easier right out of school. You got 4 years to decide on doing it.",

This often takes one of two forms:\n\n1 - A company keeps one (or just a few PE(s) on staff to review/check the design work that the rest of the team does as the project progresses.\n\n2 - A company contracts a P.E. to put their stamp on design on completed design work after the P.E. reviews it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have a P.E. stamp and I have 100% designed, installed and commissioned projects/equipment in multiple municipal facilities that have someone else's P.E. stamp on the submittal/deliverable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's nothing wrong with taking the EIT and getting your P.E.    You won't necessarily get pigeonholed into administrative jobs, but you will have to be very picky about which positions you accept for the first 10 years of your career as qualifying can often require multiple years of working directly under an already-licensed PE",

If you are not designing for the public then you don\u2019t need the license.  For example if you are only designing systems or buildings for a private industry that is only for internal use then a PE is not usually required.",

Regardless, it will be the same pay as a monthly GRA or GTA in the end; HR does that calculation. \n\nFor masters, I am not sure. Becky Wilson should be able to help you figure out the hourly pay but GTA as masters get paid around 1.2-1.3k per month, so I assume the total amount for 80 hours will be like that. But will you really do 20 hrs per week though? Remember you still have to CLOCK in hours if you are a GA and if you are a GTA, you don't need to clock in and you still get paid a monthly stipend.",

I can ask my professor if he can hire me as a GA, I think that would help a lot.  I don't plan on making too much money from the GA side of things, just get that experience in. Plus i dont think this will charge any billable credits since its just job credits so it works out!",

In my experience, very few people are super committed to the LLC project/theme (just the way life goes, not the fault of students or profs, but its a theme across majors/years/communities). That said, GC has a huge proportion of OOS/intl compared to the general population (can't speak to other LLCs). Choose whichever fits you best, getting close to profs is cool but its not a gigantic deal. Grand Challenges professors are always available so I wouldn't worry to much about that. Personally I thought the entrepreneurship aspect was cool; I haven't been super passionate about GC itself but the people I've met through it are truly phenomenal and the community itself outside of class is stellar.",

I do want to reiterate that I do not think it will make a big difference though, and the most important part is finding a strong sense of community, (which you can find through plenty of other ways such as clubs, housing, or classes on campus).",

            "selftext": "  \nHey Yellow Jackets! Bits of Good is pleased to announce that with the Fall 2024 and Summer 2024 schedules being released, GT Scheduler is up and ready to help you prepare your schedules with the **new Compare Schedules feature**!\n\nWhile GT Scheduler was originally made so students could optimize the creation of their *own* class schedules, the Compare Schedules feature will now allow users to look at their friends\u2019 schedules from within the GT Scheduler site! Once logged in with a schedule already made, click the \u201cShare Schedule\u201d button located on the right and share your schedule(s) with others by entering their email or copying the link. Email invites will appear in their inbox once sent. On the right panel, turn on the \u201cCompare Schedule\u201d switch and click on your friend\u2019s schedules to compare! Note that this feature **does not work on mobile**.\n\nGT Scheduler has also opened a **donation portal**! In light of growing engineering costs, we are asking for the help of our users to keep GT Scheduler running! These donations will enable us to continue refining our services and providing students with these tools and new features. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a **significant** difference in our ability to maintain and improve GT Scheduler. We at Bits of Good want to thank the GT community for using and supporting our work, and we can\u2019t wait to see how the future of this amazing website unfolds. Happy scheduling!  \n[https://www.gt-scheduler.org/](https://www.gt-scheduler.org/)  \n[https://donorbox.org/gt-scheduler](https://donorbox.org/gt-scheduler)",

(They have done this multiple times, not just this semester)\n\nNot only this, but what is effectively a youtube video and some scribbles of notes every week are mind-numbingly simple for a class that is supposed to be advanced and extremely important to the field of study. \n\nFor the hard part, the simple and logical solution is to go talk to the dean about this. But that is not a good idea as this lecturer is\u2026 close to the dean.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, half of the people in the class are happy about the free A, but I went into this class excited to learn about the subject I want to dedicate my career to. I feel like I\u2019m falling behind everybody else in the field, as the shit we do in this class is just basic circuit analysis that any first semester freshman in ECE can do in their sleep.\n\nIt already doesn\u2019t help that I was promised, and paid massive amounts of money, to take an in person class because I struggle to pay attention in an online format, but even if I do pay attention all I see is RC circuits and plug-and-chug equations.\n\nThis \u201cworld class\u201d engineering program can sometimes be an absolute joke, and it\u2019s obvious that some lectures should not be employed here.\n",

She also teaches some lower level classes, but for those she isn\u2019t the only professor. For VLSI, you either take her class or you dont take it at all.",

Many people who take a class with them are doing it for the free A. Edit: ~~However, if you are an EE, you will have the chance to learn and catch up in 3043. On day 1, the prof said that 3043 was your chance to learn circuits again and that's exactly what I did and passed an interview with TI a few weeks later.~~ The class, however, is not very advanced. Many who go deeper into the field view it more as a hurdle to get to the real classes. There are better professors that are teaching the advanced classes in the field. The people I know who are pursuing it as a career will say that interning experience is what actually that propelled them to be successful. The class in question just an unfortunate hurdle that everyone kind of needs to take at the moment. If you want someone to vent or discuss this with my DMs are open. But, I the situation isn't going to really change anytime soon.",

It is the definition of conflict of interest.\n\nI always read reddit but never commented until I saw this. I really feel you. I took her class during covid. Never opened her camera once. The classes comprised of her reading her lecture notes WORD FOR WORD. And she posted these lecture notes on canvas later. Exams are exactly similar to her examples on these notes. All of the classes she teach are either like this OR magically they're taught by this other professor she is related to (not hard to guess for ECEs). So, you end up learning nothing and getting a free A. During my entire 5 years at ECE, I never seen her in real life. She is just a robotic voice for me.\n\nThe problem is she always gets the best reviews on every platform (ratemyprof, CIOS, you name it) because people like 1 - their free As  2 - she is very nice to the point that there is zero rigor in the class. Again, she is a nice person, but a horrible college professor in my opinion. So if you look at metrics, GT sees no problem. To your comment of \" and it\u2019s obvious that some lectures should not be employed here,\" it's common for husband and wive duos to be hired by the same university. So maybe it was a BOGO deal in a way (again, just my theory, i obviously don't have any proof)\n\nIf there is any ECE freshmand/sophmore who is reading this - Please avoid her for anything (circuit analysis, VLSI, etc.) at all costs. Unless you have this silly challenge to try to keep your 4.0 from becoming 3.999 (nobody cares - you'll get a job if you're a good engineer not because you got an A in every course you had), you'll absolutely learn zero thing in her classes. There are 10 minute youtube videos that will educate you more than her entire semester of circuit analysis course.\n\nThere are great professors in ECE that will inspire you and remind you why you actually chose engineering in the first place. They're very rare. However, it is rewarding to find the courses that they teach. Please go find them.",

We maintain a heterogeneous network consisting of Windows, Mac OS, and Linux systems. General computer experience is necessary and additional experience on Windows, Mac, and Linux is a plus. Individuals must be enrolled at Georgia Tech but may be taking a semester without classes.\n\nThis job entails user support, diagnosing hardware, software, and network problems, configuring, installing and maintaining laptops, workstations, and servers, packaging software, and some AV support. Generally we do whatever is necessary to keep people up and running. Some hardware troubleshooting background is of interest, too. The most important quality is a willingness to learn and a commitment to building positive client relationships.\n\nThe level of commitment would be around 10-20 hours per week. Work times are somewhat flexible (business hours needed, no nights or weekends) and the individual must be reliable. Hourly rates are competitive. Work environment is relaxed. \n\n**For potential Web Student Workers:**\n\nThe College of Sciences is looking for part time help with web development. We maintain a variety of sites, primarily using Drupal and Wordpress content management systems. General computer experience is necessary, and a working knowledge of basic web design including:\n\n* HTML\n* CSS\n* Github / version control\n\nis required. Preferred experience includes:\n\n* Javascript (vanilla or any framework)\n* PHP\n* Shell scripting\n\nor prior web design is a plus.\n\nIndividuals must be enrolled at Georgia Tech but may be taking a semester without classes.\n\nThis job entails maintaining existing Drupal and Wordpress sites, handling support tickets, performing CMS updates, formatting new pages and content, creating new sites, and some occasional scripting. The most important quality is a willingness to learn and a commitment to building positive client relationships.\n\nPositions start at $15/hr. for the Summer Semester with potential to continue to work for the organization in the Fall.

                    "body": "Hey, BS/MS ME here! I went through this last year so I know how it goes\n\nFirst off, if you\u2019re graduating undergrad this semester, know that you can\u2019t register for grad classes until Phase II registration, since you\u2019re a \u201cnew\u201d student again. That means that you\u2019ll have plenty of time to figure out what\u2019s available and what\u2019s filled up. \n\nSecond, if you\u2019re registering as an undergrad, you\u2019ll need level permits to actually be able to register for grad classes. I believe that also opens during Phase II, so you can try to request overrides in advance but they may tell you to wait\n\nLastly, your actual question. I didn\u2019t really struggle getting into any major area classes except for one, but it opened up within the first week of class. Just like undergrad, people will drop classes within the first week of registration and you\u2019ve got a decent chance of getting in. As an undergrad I went for ME 6104 during my last semester and got in just fine\n\nBy the way, not sure how you\u2019re planning your grad school credit hours, but 9 credits in a semester is enough to fill up your time. I did 12 last semester and it took over time from my extra curriculars, so spread it out as much as you can",

I also kinda forgot some stuff. But it was ok. You can also look at his rate my professor's reviews to get other perspectives. He provides study guides before exams which are actually helpful. From my perspective, I feel like you have to do much more work for 1554 than 3406. \n\nAlso, there are so many linear TAs. You can always get help if you want to review some topics.",

You should probably do a little bit of review of some basic calculations like determinants, row reductions, and how to find a basis for Null Space, Column Space, and Row space. \n\nI've seen that most people struggle with 1554 because of the time required inside and outside of class, and also the exams sometimes being tough.\n\nFor 3406, Loss uses Gilbert Strang's book, \"Introduction to Linear Algebra.\" (He uses 6th edition but you can find the 4th and 5th editions online for free -- The content is mostly the same). The best thing about the book is that it has an entire lecture video series on YouTube by MIT Open Courseware. The lecture series playlist is called \"MIT 18.06SC Linear Algebra, Fall 2011.\"\n\nLoss is an amazing professor and breaks down the content with helpful visualizations. I strongly recommend taking 3406 with him. Homework assignments were given every 1 or 2 weeks and were not time-consuming. His exams were quite similar to the practice exams, and were fair if you went to lecture and did the homework.",

I'm currently taking Chemistry at a community college near my university to fulfill that requirement for computer engineering in fact. \n\nPhysics 1 will count as your lab science elective. \n\nSo because they don't care about +s and -s, only A, B, C, it is a bit hard to get that 3.3 right. To be safe, you'll want at least 2 As and 2 Bs for a solid math/science GPA of 3.5. If you just take Calc 1, 2, and physics then you'll need just 1 A and 2 Bs, it's not too difficult to calculate. \n\nI had a perfect gpa last semester, taking writing, anthropology, calc 2, and two CompSci classes. This semester I have a B in CompSci, and close As in writing 2, calc 3, physics 1, and chemistry.\n\nSo because I got an A in calc 2 last semester, I need at least an A and 2 Bs in calc 3, physics, and chem.\n\nThis is actually making me nervous as well, because they are quite close As and I'm considering dropping Calc 3 because of this so I can get a B in physics and a B in chem and be fine no risks.\n\nAll this to say, the stress never stops lol\n\nBut I think you'll be fine as a math major, dedicate all your time to calc 1 and 2 and physics. Other classes should be less priority but don't let any easy As become Bs. \n\n  \nDid that all make sense or do you need some clarification? I just kind of ranted on and on my fault",

I hope you can help me make an informed decision.   \nPost Masters, I plan to join the industry rather than research. And I am slightly inclined towards Physical Design. \n\n* Georgia Tech - Amazing Brand, so great respect for jobs. Great in Physical Design (both Analog and Digital) and Comp. Microarchitecture. I heard an amazing professor who is a legend in Tapeout joined recently.\n* UT Austin - Very affordable tuition fees, access to Teaching Assistantships. Austin is the hub of most semiconductor companies. Good in Digital Physical Design and has access to a large variety of courses.\n\nWhich will be a better school for transitioning to the industry?",

However, there don't seem many study-abroad opportunities even outside of South Korea for BME students. I wanted to take advantage of the study abroad opportunity, while I still had core classes to take because it would have been easier to transfer those credits. However, now that I've finished all my core classes, I only have BME-specific classes which makes me think I'll have a harder time transferring credits.  Is anyone a BME student who studied abroad after taking all of your core classes? For context, I'll be finishing my second year this Spring. ",

The inspector canceled and rescheduled with us three times over the course of a few months. They finally came and started their inspections shortly after your post and after many of the certs had expired. It took them a few weeks to complete the initial inspections across campus, and they now need to return to complete follow-up inspections (for example, elevators that were out of order during the initial visit).",

I'm also a little concerned with enrollment projection, since tech is already increasing enrollment too fast.

Certainly also most of what I described could be done in much less space, though I will note part of why the auto show has moved is because of parking lots being removed. I would guess it could be held on the top of one of the decks though so not a hard fix. Biggest question for me is access to the buildings for equipment moving, as I noted in another comment the lathes and water jet and other things in the Invention Studio and Machining Mall were delivered on large trucks and required heavy equipment to move them. There will be tradeoffs with any plans but looks like GT has been looking at building in this area already so they've probably thought about it pretty thoroughly. More housing and classroom space is needed with enrollment increasing.",

And, if you look back historically to changes that have happened on the campus over the decades, it is clearly trending in a clear direction (like, Tech Green used to be a parking lot. Can you imagine going back to that). So, the leadership of the institute have a clear intent to make more efficient use of space on the campus and want to axe surface lots where possible. \n\nI would say to not be sad about this, but take the bright side and view it as possible room for growth. These lots is as a readily available space to expand when the needs and resources available arise, and the history shows that GT\u2019s leadership is more than open to replacing surface parking lots with new development. As GT continues to grow they can utilize that area to build more of whatever is most pressing (labs, dorms, classrooms, etc).",

Usually a plane... then Marta, then the bus or walking... \n\nGTs 25 year plan does include the removal of most flat lots and moving those spaces into parking decks strategically placed around campus while keeping the number of spaces approximately equal. \n\nWith respect to your linked comment. I'd be very curious as to the number of parking spots the GT had back in those days vs presently. Tbh I wouldn't be surprised if there are more parking spots now then there were back then. \n\nIn addition we are continuing to grow the number of students and the facilities available on campus. This is a good thing, but we are limited in what land we have available. Flat lots are just... Not space efficient or good uses of land... From like $/sq ft usage.

Go on Historic Aerials or use Google Earth and you'll see a surprising number of large lots that are no longer there across campus.\n\n&gt; Flat lots are just... Not space efficient or good uses of land... From like $/sq ft usage. Sorry if you feel otherwise.\n\nI am not claiming they're space-efficient, and \"good\" is a value judgement.  Overall, I think parking lots are way-overbuilt and have unacceptably low average usage rates across the country and especially metro Atlanta, but *not* at GT.  I am simply against the \"fewer/no cars\" mindset when no pragmatic tradeoffs are offered.  As I said, those folks will never be satisfied by any level of reduction until it's utterly complete.",

This is a living document that's been around since like the 1910s. \n\nIn 2002 the Campus Master Plan states there were 9744 parking spaces. In 2023 the Campus Master Plan states there were 13256 parking spaces. I'm unable to locate the 1997, 1991 or earlier CMPs online tho they are available through GTs archives. \n\n&gt;No pragmatic tradeoffs\n\nThese documents have literally pages dedicated to talking about the strategic plans for parking and why certain decisions are desired. For example - the reduction of surface lots is largely tied to the simple fact that Fulton county (like many cities) have established taxes/fees associated with the amount of sq ft. of impermeable land (including parking lots) that is owned by an organization. This fee is driven by the fact that we use a combined storm water/sanitary sewer system and it is simply becoming overwhelmed. To fix this we needed to raise funds to build a better system/work to reduce the amount of water run off. Hence the tax. These decisions by tech is to... Save money by reducing our tax liability. \n\n&gt;Until it's utterly complete\n\nWhile there may be some folks that believe this. I think your lumping of all folks who desire a reduction of cars/parking spaces into one monolith is both reductive and unsubstantiated. Do better.",

I've done research and found that HP students live in seperate dorms and have seperate classes with a small number of students. Will this limit the amount of friends you can make and make your college life bland and boring?\nAlso, I found that the hefner-armstrong dorms have community bathrooms. Is this true for all dorms at Georgia Tech or is it just for these dorms. I really would want to have a dorm with which the bathroom is connected and is just for the use of my roommate and I. \nLastly, I want to ask whether the HP is only for first year students or if it lasts for all 4 years. If it lasts for all 4 years then is it possible to change your dorm building after the first year?\nI know my questions might seem a little dumb but I am an international student who's never visited Georgia or GeorgiaTech so some help would be greatly appreciated. See you all there!",

                    "body": "Hi, HP student here! TLDR: The honors program is worth it and I highly recommend. \n\nTo answer your questions in more details: \n\n1) We all live in Eighth St. Apartments. Freshmen used to live in Hefner-Armstrong, but now everyone lives across the street in 2, 4, or 6 person apartments where everyone gets their own room and there is a bathroom for every pair of two roommates (eg. the 6 person apartments have 3 bathrooms). The dorm style living spaces (which most freshmen live in) do have community bathrooms. I personally think that dorm style living spaces are better for freshmen to meet new people, but you won't be in the honors program and you will have to deal with community bathrooms in those.\n\n2) The honors program classes are optional and the vast majority of the classes we take are not honors program ones. It is cool to have access to that extra resource, but it really doesn't limit us in getting to know more people.\n\n3) You can meet tons of people through events and clubs on campus as well as through housing. There are tons of clubs that are super tight knit and will help you have a vibrant social life. There are hundreds of students in the honors program (roughly 200 a year), and that is where I have met many of my best friends. In my experience, the people I have met through HP have made my college experience far more exciting and you dont need to worry about HP making it bland.\n\n4) The honors program does last for all four years. In the past, students had the option to move elsewhere on campus and stay in the honors program, but now if you want to live on campus and remain in the honors program you have to live in Eighth St. You can still live elsewhere on campus in future years but you would have to leave HP to do so. You can always live off campus in the future and remain in the honors program. As you will find out when you come here, it is really hard to get on campus housing as an upper year. The honors program makes it MUCH easier to get on- campus housing.\n\n5) Other things of note: The honors program isn't perfect. The housing is a HUGE part of the benefit of the program, but you do have to live on West campus. I prefer West to East, but many people who want more parties prefer East. Also, if you are a business or LMC major, most of your classes will be a pretty far walk from West campus. Finally, companies I have worked for have liked seeing the honors program on my resume.",

            "selftext": "As I progress classes for my Computational Media degree, grappling with Data Structures has started to dampened my enthusiasm for coding. Plus, I\u2018m like 99% sure that I\u2019ll get a D in this class. Wouldn\u2019t it look bad if I have to retake the class.? I don\u2019t think coding is the right fit for me... However, I did find myself increasingly drawn to the realm of website and application design as I take other classes. This shift in interests has led me to consider transitioning to the LMC major. Plus, I thought actively participating in clubs like the Design Club or WebDev Club may be more fun and offer me more practical experience compared to continuing with my CS classes. I was contemplating switching to industrial design, but considering graduating a year late and being unable to study abroad at my desired university makes me hesitant to pursue this route. However, I\u2019m considering to minor in it if I switch majors.\n\nNow the main issue I'm grappling with is uncertainty regarding whether obtaining a degree in LMC will notably enhance my chances of success in my future career. May sound like a nonsense but I'm worried how potentialemployers would view me as an LMC major pursuing opportunities in UI design (main) or Web Design\u2026 I feel like they will want more to people with ID/CM degree than a person with LMC degree\u2026 Am I just overthinking too much.?\n\nWill sticking with CM be better or switching to LMC and minoring in Industrial Design would be better and more helpful for UI designer??",

I've worked as a programmer, a QA analyst, did some non-major related work for a few years, and now I've worked as a product manager at my current company for about 4 years. I have objectively been a high performer at every single one of those positions, and I was straight up not a great student. No 4.0 semesters for me, and I had to take more than a couple of classes more than once. Data Structures...let's just say I became VERY familiar with the coursework of that class.\n\nDid that lock me out of a particular set of companies coming right out of college? Yeah, but unless you want to code in isolation all day or get paid the absolute maximum amount of money straight from the start, in hindsight that was a perfectly fine tradeoff for me.\n\nThe question \"What will my employer think of this degree vs CS\" was one that I was also constantly thinking about while going through the coursework. The answer is not a damn thing. Every school has its own little nomenclature for degrees and employers aren't bothered to care about the distinction. They care about the name Georgia Tech.\n\nHonestly, you are going to be 10x more competent than a CS major from 85% of the other schools you're likely to work alongside. Georgia Tech does an amazing job of making you a competent and thoughtful programmer.\n\nIf you love your LMC coursework including the tech-based classes and struggle a little bit with the CS courses, then I would say that you are in the exact right major.\n\nWhat I think I gained from going through the program that my CS brother and sisters do not is what I would call an actual well rounded education.\n\nI am both very technically proficient and also developed great interpersonal and communication skills that I think have done more to get me promoted and raises than any code I could have written.",

You're definitely right to overthink when it comes to this type of topic, but as an LMC major who is doing uiux design and got an internship this summer for design at a relatively well known company, I'd say lmc is not as bad as you think it might be :)\n\nI was a computer science major for my first year and I ended up fully hating it. But ux doesn't *require* coding knowledge so I switched out. But if you want to go into webdev, I'd suggest maybe staying a Cm major. I don't know anything about what goes on in coding classes, but from what everyone else is saying you don't need to be amazing in your cs classes.\n\nI've talked to many advisors recruiters and professionals in the ux design industry and many of them agree that your degree/major is not going to make or break your application. Your projects and portfolio will. This is why participating in clubs that have design positions could help you too.  \n\nFeel free to pm/dm me if you have any questions! I'd be happy to answer them",

I think a lot of people consider CS1332 to be one of the harder CS courses (save for 4000-level Networking courses or whatever). I think if you can make it through Data Structures, then you'll be fine. Also, I know several software engineers @ FAANG who have retaken 1332, so you'll probably be fine especially since you want to do UI (UX?) design which doesn't even use data structures.\n2. Plenty of people in the industry aren't CM/ID majors/equivalent. More design-focused majors will give you an advantage in having more projects/coursework that work with design for your portfolio. On the other hand, having a coding background definitely gives you an edge over other candidates because recruiters like to see that you can communicate effectively with the developers on your team. CM is nice because you get 1 thread LMC and 1 thread CS, so it's kind of the best of both worlds. Feel free to minor in ID if you have extra time in your graduation schedule but I don't think it'll make or break anything.\n3. Definitely continue attending Design Club, GT Webdev, etc. Clubs are a great way to gain experience and network. Especially for internships, it shows passion (where you will lack industry experience). Clubs also work on cool projects that you can use for your portfolio. They're also just a great learning resource because IMO there aren't a lot of courses that will help you learn UX (at least when I was a student).",

The fact that she knows a little about the process of turning a Figma design into a working front end website is helpful. It just gives you more sympathy I guess. \n\nI don\u2019t think you should force the clubs. Passion projects are really where it\u2019s at. If u can find some ppl to work with and complete a fully flushed out project that is the good stuff",

But on the other hand, if I do a thesis does that mean I will have to be in a lab over the summer rather than an internship?

I'm planning on majoring in mechanical engineering.\n\nFor Vanderbilt, I have received a scholarship that covers my tuition. I also got the Davis scholarship at Columbia which would cover about 50k. I haven't received my financial aid package from Georgia Tech or Duke. I have toured Columbia and Georgia Tech and loved both campuses. I plan on visiting Vanderbilt and Duke in next few weeks. I am currently leaning towards Georgia Tech(#5) and Columbia(#17) because they're the better engineering schools according to US News Rankings. I am still open towards Duke and Vanderbilt. Duke (#22) it is well known and has a strong engineering program. Vanderbilt(#42) isn't as good for engineering but it has a good reputation. Is Georgia Tech's engineering education significantly better because of the ranking difference or are top 20 schools about the same? I also wish to know their rankings for mechanical engineering.\n\nI feel like Georgia Tech will prepare me better for engineering but Columbia will have more career opportunities because it's an Ivy and it's in New York. I like Atlanta more than New York but I'm fine with living in New York. I would prefer to have a STEM heavy course load which Georgia Tech has. Columbia would be less STEM heavy because of the \"Core Curriculum\". My main concern is which school will help me get the best/most engineering job offers. The community and environment is another important factor for me. What other factors should I consider?\n\nI appreciate any advice! Thanks!",

GT is top 10 in most engineering fields. Columbia being in NY won't necessarily help with job opportunities in mechanical engineering. \n\nThe *real* question comes down to financial aid. If you're not from GA and you don't have a major scholarship in hand already, you will not get good aid from Tech and you should consider another school. A top school is not worth six figure debt.",

But, the reality has to be spoken, I got rejected from Gatech, but from numerous conversations that I have had with Gatech students , I have come to understand that there is a very good chance of getting funding once you are on campus. So if you are worried about the tuition and fees there is a realistic chance of getting funding.\n\nHowever, as I said before, I know where you're coming from as I myself am trying elentlessely to find an advisor for funding. One piece of information is that professors keep getting projects round the year. The professor you're trying to work with may not have a project right now but may get a project later(maybe in may, jun(maybe). The idea or the strategy is to be persistent! Keep trying, be courteous when asking for an opportunity. I have met some people who managed to get funding before going to the campus, so just hang in there tight!",

Is uoft's asip program really that bad and how hard is it to be internship-hunting in Canada on your own (without doing co-op or help from the university board). Lastly, is GTech with co-op a better option for me, especially to get high-paying swe jobs post-grad or is UW co-op going to be significantly better for both Canada and US jobs? Thanks in advance if you read this!\n\nFor more context towards a balanced life and cost: GTech is the cheapest. I have more friends studying in the toronto area than waterloo or atlanta. Atlanta is closest to my home country so its's the fastest and cheapest flight. I have never been to any of these places so I'm not sure where will be the best to spend my undergrad.",

I am highly considering GaTech's co-op but was wondering if the fact that you are only allowed to work for one company actually be counter-productive since it seems to be risky and very hit or miss and I'm looking to gather as much experience as possible. Is it possible to work a fourth co-op term at a different company after completing the minimum 3 and are there any work arounds for switching co-op jobs if better offers are received. I really like the advantage of being able to work at different times of the year in co-op rather than only being limited to the summer and graduating in 5 years in not an issue for me. Additionally, I would like to know if getting internships and co-ops are hard to get in CS as an intl at Tech as well as if you can/should look for your own jobs outside of what is available on CareerBuzz ( haven't enrolled at Tech yet so unsure exactly of how it works). Lastly, can I expect the pay to be around $16 on the lower end for cs/swe jobs? Thanks so much in advance if you read this and feel free to pm me if you have any advice!",

If that is the case, there are n lecture times and you watch pre-recorded ones and basically it's no different from a Udemy course with a lot of homework. But again, this is my assumption, I've never seen async referred to as video classes. A way to test it if the meeting times are NA.",

One of my worse grades at GT. If you're Intel thread, don't be like me; attend lecture and you'll be fine.\u00a0\n\n\nCS 2050 - ironically enough one of my favorite classes at GT CS classes. Ronnie Howard is goated. Definitely a lot of work but if you camp office hours and take advantage of TAs, getting an A probably won't be too hard.\n\n\nCS 2340 - this class is a joke but an easy A. They improved it this semester but I wish they'd just throw it out entirely and replace it with a 2000 level web or mobile dev class where we're taught development as a focus and object-oriented design/analysis as an aside (semester project has been a JAVAFX app, Android app, and I think now website?) Seems to just test on memorization.\n\n\nCS 2110- another favorite of mine. Learned about circuits, gates, Assembly (not a useful type), C, etc. There's some overlap with 2050 in terms of truth tables, De Morgan's, and what not. I don't think it was particularly hard but I know some people struggle with the class. Think it's way easier compared to implementing and understanding a bunch of algos in AI though.",

I have had several friends that I've graduated with that didn't have internships that got jobs right out of graduation, including in the nuclear world.

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm Will.  I'm currently serving as a Senator in the Graduate Student Senate.\n\nAs many of you are aware, SGA has been working to improve our RSO funding policies.  Today, a 72 page document was introduced to the Senate containing many proposed amendments.  I've attached the full document here:\n\n[SGA's Proposed RSO Funding Policy Amendments](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/GeorgiaTechSGA/Ec6M58-7PcNMmRrjr09-ZYABq2746M5t_oH74zlx1uj0Tw?e=3TeoSY)\n\nI specifically would like to call your attention to the proposed amendments in Section 9.6, which **introduces hard caps on the total funding any one RSO could receive in a fiscal year**, Section 14.5, which **allows SGA to retroactively revoke funding that has already been allocated to an RSO**, and Section 4.2.5, which sets aside $75,000 for \"Campus Maintenance and Development\", thereby **reducing the funding available for RSOs**.\n\nThere are many other proposed amendments in the document.  Some (in my opinion) are good, some (in my opinion) are bad, and some are relatively mundane.  I encourage you to read the proposals yourself and come to your own conclusions.\n\nIf you are passionate about RSO funding, I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the proposals under consideration and make your voice heard.  **You can voice your opinion to the Undergraduate House of Representatives tomorrow (April 2) at 7:30 PM in Smithgall 117 (Flag Building).**  Likewise, **you can voice your opinion to the Graduate Student Senate next Monday (April 8) at 11:00 AM in Clary Theater (Bill Moore Success Center).**\n\nOne final note, I know many of the folks who have been involved with developing these amendments.  I KNOW that they are good, well-intentioned people trying to make a bad situation better.  A policy of this magnitude deserves scrutiny and passionate debate.  I am hopeful that any discussions generated by this post remain focused on the policy itself, and not the people involved with trying to fix it.",

                            "body": "This is a vast simplification of the issue, but essentially in 2020 Georgia Tech's lawyers rewrote the SAF funding policies, and removed the ability for SGA to have any discretion over funding decisions.  Every year, many RSOs apply for a budget through SGA.  Under the revised policy, if the total amount of funding requested exceeded the total amount of funding available, all budgets would be cut by a uniform percent such that SGA didn't allocate more money than was available.  Then Covid happened, and RSOs generally weren't requesting funding through SGA anyway, so the SAF reserves grew abnormally large and in the years following covid RSOs grew accustomed to SGA having virtually unlimited funding to distribute.  SGA burned through it's reserves pretty quickly, because under the new policy it literally did not have the authority to deny funding requests if funding was available (and the request complied with RSO policy).  The issue here is that there was nothing stopping an RSO from submitting a request for several hundred thousand dollars (which would never get funded at any other university) and forcing SGA to cut the budgets of all other RSOs to accommodate the exorbitant requests.  This came to a head this year, when the funding requested was more than double the funding available, and therefore all RSOs were looking at over a 50% budget cut.  To help insulate smaller RSOs that are relatively less able to solicit external funding, SGA amended its budget cut formulas to a bracket system, where the portion of a budget request below a certain threshold was reduced at a smaller rate than the portion of a budget request above a certain threshold.  This was viewed by some as \"absolutely shafting\" some large RSOs, but we we're all shafted regardless.",

Recently the lawyers have agreed to be removed from the process, hence the flurry of proposed amendments seen here.",

For a little bit of background, Georgia Tech (and I believe all other USG schools) has a Mandatory Student Fee Advisory Committee (MSFAC).  There are four undergrads, four grad students, and four admin folks that have a vote on the committee.  Every year (except for this year), MSFAC votes to set the level of each mandatory student fee.  Officially, this vote is a \"recommendation\" that is presented to President Cabrera, but in my experience President Cabrera legitimately values student input and, to my knowledge, has always accepted the recommendation of MSFAC.  At that point, President Cabrera officially submits the proposed fee rates to USG, and USG has the final authority to approve or deny the proposed fee rates.  However this year USG threw all of this out the window and mandated that all student fees be recalculated as if part time students paid fees at half the rate of full time students, and online students paid fees at one quarter the full time rate.  MSFAC was told by USG to not request any fee increases this year.  USG is going to look at what the new fees would be under that new system, and vote on potentially moving to something like that, which would shake up the fee level anyone pays.  TL:DR, nobody knows what's happening with fees this year",

And it's a good idea to [register your bike](https://police.gatech.edu/bicycles-campus) with GTPD in case it needs to be removed for some reason (only lock to racks, not trees, railings, etc.) or get stolen, so they can track you down if they find it.

            "selftext": "Hi! I'm working on a video covering the 2023 Georgia Tech football season and I'm in need of a lot of film. This could be literally anything: personal recordings while at games, reactions, recordings of big plays from the sidelines, etc. I want it all. I'm not sure the best way to send it to me, but if you pm me, I'll provide my email and maybe I can download it from there. Otherwise, you could comment or pm a link to the video via YouTube or Google Drive.\n\nThis will be used in a public YouTube video, so please be aware of that before sending me something you might not want out there. I'm also happy to credit you if you'd like.\n\nAlso... does anyone happen to know where I can find a higher quality version of this video of Brent Key following the 2022 Duke win?

I would suggest tho what the top comment says if u don\u2019t want to spend too much. I\u2019ve seen some hella good hair done by students and it\u2019s p cheap.\n\nAs for performing your normal routine before, it really depends on who is cutting it. I\u2019ve had ppl ask me to not wash it directly before so they can see it\u2019s natural state, or to wash it before bc they r more comfortable with freshly washed hair (like washes 30 mins b4). The consensus seems to be wash b4 although if u regularly see a specific person, ask them. Communication with the stylist is key",

I contacted the insurance provider United Healthcare, and they informed me that pre-existing conditions like Crohn's Disease would be covered under this policy. I am currently on a regiment of Adalimumab injections (fortnightly) and Azathioprine tablets for maintaining my remission, and I wanted help on understanding the process of continuing my treatment here. \n\nI see that there is an option of Humira Copay where I can get my injection for 5$ a month, but I am unclear on how that process goes. Going through the highlights of the insurance plan, I saw that the Out of Pocket Maximum is $6,350 which I assume I would hit quite easily with the frequency of my biologicals, but even that much is a huge amount in medical fees every year.\n\nIs there anyone at Tech with Crohn's disease (or taking the same medication as me) who could guide me with the technicalities of the US Healthcare system? Help would be greatly appreciated. ",

She called me screaming and crying about how I was taking money from her. Anyway, I didn\u2019t pay her or let me claim her and got ~$1000 back which was really amazing for me at the time.",

After you pass Piedmont Ave you'll get a crossing to a two-way protected bike lane that will bring you alongside Piedmont Park until you hit the beltline.\n\nIf you bike on the road, just take the whole lane. The traffic isn't too fast in that section ^ because of all the lights\n\nIf you don't want to get on the road, it's technically illegal but it's sometimes safer to get on the sidewalk and go super slow, which I recommend if you're taking the 10th St route crossing the I-85 on-ramp going from campus to midtown. Public safety bikes will also ride on sidewalks so imo it's not a huge deal as long as you yield to pedestrians",

Unfortunately, a class that has been historically offered in the summer for the past few years (CS 4590) is not being offered this summer and it has derailed my plans. I have contacted my advisor, but hasn\u2019t really helped the past few years. Is there anything I can do and do you guys have any advice?",

I am highly considering GaTech's co-op but was wondering if the fact that you are only allowed to work for one company actually be counter-productive since it seems to be risky and very hit or miss and I'm looking to gather as much experience as possible. Is it possible to work a fourth co-op term at a different company after completing the minimum 3 and are there any work arounds for switching co-op jobs if better offers are received. I really like the advantage of being able to work at different times of the year in co-op rather than only being limited to the summer and graduating in 5 years in not an issue for me. Additionally, I would like to know if getting internships and co-ops are hard to get in CS as an intl at Tech as well as if you can/should look for your own jobs outside of what is available on CareerBuzz ( haven't enrolled at Tech yet so unsure exactly of how it works). Lastly, can I expect the pay to be around $16 on the lower end for cs/swe jobs? Thanks so much in advance if you read this and feel free to pm me if you have any advice!",

Internships occur year-round. PLENTY of internships in the fall and spring.\n\n&gt;internships and co-ops are hard to get in CS as an intl at Tech\n\nThere are a couple more [hoops](https://isss.oie.gatech.edu/isss/hiring-international-students-scholars-or-student-interns) to jump though, but international students are hired all the time.\n\n&gt;can I expect the pay to be around $16 on the lower end for cs/swe jobs\n\nDepends on where in the country you go. Within Atlanta, you can expect at least $20/hr as a SWE intern. In west coast tech hubs, it'll be much more, depending on company. I know interns that make the annual equivalent of $120k which is $60/hr.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm currently facing a challenging situation and I'm reaching out for advice from anyone who has been through something similar or knows the steps I should take.\n\nI was recently informed by Georgia Tech's registrar's office that my Bachelor of Science degree from ETH Zurich doesn't meet their admission criteria for further study (after being admitted into graduate school ~3 month ago). They've stated that I need a \"4-year license or diploma\" from a Swiss institution. However, the Bachelor's degree program at ETH Zurich that I'm enrolled in spans only 3 years, adhering to the Bologna Process standardization. \n\nThis situation is particularly perplexing to me since I had assumed that a bachelor\u2019s degree from ETH Zurich would be sufficient for admission, especially considering that GT accepts 3-year Bachelor's degrees from Germany, which follows the same Bologna Process and that ETH's Bachelor degree is an internationally recognised BSc from a top tier university.\n\nAdding to the confusion, the \"license\" they refer to is typically awarded by vocational schools, and the \"diploma\" is a relic from before the Swiss education system adopted the Bologna system in 1999. ETH Zurich no longer awards these \"diplomas,\" and the standardized bachelor's degree program now is 3 years, not 4.\n\nHas anyone else encountered such an issue with the recognition (or lack thereof) of international degrees by US institutions? I could really use some advice on how to navigate this situation or suggestions on whom to contact within the academic administration to address my case.\n\nAny insights or guidance would be hugely appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

To be fair, the 3-year standard of many engineering universities in Europe is not exactly equivalent to a 4-year bachelor's in the US. That's why at ETHZ you're expected to pursue a Master's, while in the US it's the norm not to.\n\nMaybe see if you can find anyone who went to TU Delft and other similar universities, since they should be in the same situation.",

At that time, I was in a fairly comfortable position; working for two years as a software engineer since 2021, and both my parents were earning.\n\nMy mother unfortunately got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in May 2023, around the time I was preparing for my visa process. My father had to resign from his job to care for her, and I deferred my admission to Fall 2024 and continued working in India to be her secondary care giver. She ultimately passed away a few weeks ago.\n\nWe incurred tremendous medical expenses over the last year &amp; insurance barely covered anything. While I have some savings from my own, I cannot rely on my father for funding as he isn't earning right now. Getting a loan is also very hard right now due to lack of any earning co-signer, which is needed by most Indian banks.\n\nAs of now, I'm super confused regarding my MS plans. Gatech is my dream school and i was thrilled to have received an admit from a very competitive pool of candidates.\n\nWhile I understand that there are no outright scholarships for international students at Gatech, I'm wondering if it's possible to secure a GTA/GRA or any other paid work to support my degree. I am aware that we are not supposed to mail professors with unofficial emails (we won't get those before August), is there any way we can reach out right now ? Alternatively, would an online MS be a better option?",

A deaf blind neurodivergent paraplegic person who only speaks K\u2019iche and has zero access to internet and caregivers? Who happens to visit GT to present on nuclear engineering? Your mentality of trying to accommodate for 100% of cases is why institutions and governments simply stop providing services for everyone. Because the threat and horror of only providing accommodations for 90% of people. Better 0% than 90%, okay. Cuz the only thing that will make you happy is zero bus service for everyone (equality/inclusion) or personalized mobility devices for everyone (also equity/inclusion). Let\u2019s just make all education virtual and simply shut down the campus. Because a select few people have difficulties with transportation or leaving the home. So if everyone dials in on Zoom, then we\u2019re all unmarginalized and treated fairly.",

I'm comparing the CITY of Atlanta to other CITIES. In Singapore, the ramps are about flush. The front door does not have a ramp bc it's only for entry so it's narrower by design so that the driver can check if people are tapping in. In Tokyo, the main avenues and forms of public transport are extremely accessible (more so than Atlanta, where the sidewalks are death traps for even normal pedestrians given how shit the local drivers are). Many new and administrative buildings are absolutely wheelchair accessible (key word being new, you can't necessarily expect a temple on the top of a hill to demolish its 500 year old historical staircase).\n\nAnd now, again, how did this comment address my points about seating for buses? The buses that largely have a narrow staircase to climb to access and are extremely inaccessible, forcing people who need accommodations to use alternative forms of transportation, often at their own great expense if they have to leave campus.\n\nYou have a huge problem with ignorance.

Or do you just do to developing nations and act the rich tourist and not actually interact with people, so you have no idea what those countries are actually like? Or are you just racist?\n\nNot all of them are better, but quite a few are, and that should really not be the case. Admittedly, Latin American countries also tend to lag behind in large population centers, as do many central African countries from what I've heard. But almost every SEA country has better bus infrastructure than Atlanta.\n\nWhy are you defending Atlanta's shit infrastructure as if you wouldn't also benefit from it improving?\n\nAlso, \"first world?\" Are you some alum from the 90s or something? We're not in the cold war anymore.",

Sure you went to some \"different\" countries, and you probably took your pictures and stuff, that is really cool, nice bro. \n\nTo me, having an actual metro system is pretty cool, and a bus system for my own university?

I'm sure that that blows your mind away, but it's the truth. Wait until you visit another developing nation and actually take public transport. \n\nAlso, purposefully misquoting people isn't a good look. Where did I say \"any\" developing nation?

By the time I realized I had chosen poorly, the state patrol started closing exit ramps. So I couldn't escape at I-75N nor 17th/16th/14th. Now I was funneled into the connector gridlock street party. I eventually made it to the North Avenue exit ramp but was then stuck there for an hour. I had a tiny car, so I managed to hop the sidewalk adjacent to Smith dormitory, and drive backwards down the sidewalk. \n\nI had a wall on one side between me and the dorms, and power poles and a mailbox between me and the North Avenue/Williams Street ramp. So it took a hot minute but I backed down the sidewalk until I got to the Brittain service entrance, turned around, and then drove down Williams Street and onto campus. Once people saw what I had done, others followed behind. \n\nAnd that is how I liberated the North Avenue interstate ramp during Freaknik '94.",

Not to mention that I don't see myself going for any sort of administrative position.\n\nAre all engineers required to get a PE license, or is this actually a less traveled path than I think? For anyone who chose not to do it, how did that affect your career? And is there any advantage in working in more design based fields with a PE license?",

Also for some states you have to have a PE on staff to offer engineering services in that state. Some even break out SE and all other. Now, you could just hire out the stamping part.They're many companies out there that you can pay for their stamp, some shady. Again, I would tell anyone in the big 2 (CE and ME) to take their FE just cause it is easier right out of school. You got 4 years to decide on doing it.",

Regardless, it will be the same pay as a monthly GRA or GTA in the end; HR does that calculation. \n\nFor masters, I am not sure. Becky Wilson should be able to help you figure out the hourly pay but GTA as masters get paid around 1.2-1.3k per month, so I assume the total amount for 80 hours will be like that. But will you really do 20 hrs per week though? Remember you still have to CLOCK in hours if you are a GA and if you are a GTA, you don't need to clock in and you still get paid a monthly stipend.",

In my experience, very few people are super committed to the LLC project/theme (just the way life goes, not the fault of students or profs, but its a theme across majors/years/communities). That said, GC has a huge proportion of OOS/intl compared to the general population (can't speak to other LLCs). Choose whichever fits you best, getting close to profs is cool but its not a gigantic deal. Grand Challenges professors are always available so I wouldn't worry to much about that. Personally I thought the entrepreneurship aspect was cool; I haven't been super passionate about GC itself but the people I've met through it are truly phenomenal and the community itself outside of class is stellar.",

I do want to reiterate that I do not think it will make a big difference though, and the most important part is finding a strong sense of community, (which you can find through plenty of other ways such as clubs, housing, or classes on campus).",

This was after the curve he gave. I did check DegreeWorks &amp; it said coursses require prereq of D or higher.

Bits of Good is pleased to announce that with the Fall 2024 and Summer 2024 schedules being released, GT Scheduler is up and ready to help you prepare your schedules with the **new Compare Schedules feature**!\n\nWhile GT Scheduler was originally made so students could optimize the creation of their *own* class schedules, the Compare Schedules feature will now allow users to look at their friends\u2019 schedules from within the GT Scheduler site! Once logged in with a schedule already made, click the \u201cShare Schedule\u201d button located on the right and share your schedule(s) with others by entering their email or copying the link. Email invites will appear in their inbox once sent. On the right panel, turn on the \u201cCompare Schedule\u201d switch and click on your friend\u2019s schedules to compare! Note that this feature **does not work on mobile**.\n\nGT Scheduler has also opened a **donation portal**! In light of growing engineering costs, we are asking for the help of our users to keep GT Scheduler running! These donations will enable us to continue refining our services and providing students with these tools and new features. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a **significant** difference in our ability to maintain and improve GT Scheduler. We at Bits of Good want to thank the GT community for using and supporting our work, and we can\u2019t wait to see how the future of this amazing website unfolds. Happy scheduling!  \n[https://www.gt-scheduler.org/](https://www.gt-scheduler.org/)  \n[https://donorbox.org/gt-scheduler](https://donorbox.org/gt-scheduler)",

(They have done this multiple times, not just this semester)\n\nNot only this, but what is effectively a youtube video and some scribbles of notes every week are mind-numbingly simple for a class that is supposed to be advanced and extremely important to the field of study. \n\nFor the hard part, the simple and logical solution is to go talk to the dean about this. But that is not a good idea as this lecturer is\u2026 close to the dean.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, half of the people in the class are happy about the free A, but I went into this class excited to learn about the subject I want to dedicate my career to. I feel like I\u2019m falling behind everybody else in the field, as the shit we do in this class is just basic circuit analysis that any first semester freshman in ECE can do in their sleep.\n\nIt already doesn\u2019t help that I was promised, and paid massive amounts of money, to take an in person class because I struggle to pay attention in an online format, but even if I do pay attention all I see is RC circuits and plug-and-chug equations.\n\nThis \u201cworld class\u201d engineering program can sometimes be an absolute joke, and it\u2019s obvious that some lectures should not be employed here.\n",

On day 1, the prof said that 3043 was your chance to learn circuits again and that's exactly what I did and passed an interview with TI a few weeks later.~~ The class, however, is not very advanced. Many who go deeper into the field view it more as a hurdle to get to the real classes. There are better professors that are teaching the advanced classes in the field. The people I know who are pursuing it as a career will say that interning experience is what actually that propelled them to be successful. The class in question just an unfortunate hurdle that everyone kind of needs to take at the moment. If you want someone to vent or discuss this with my DMs are open.

It is the definition of conflict of interest.\n\nI always read reddit but never commented until I saw this. I really feel you. I took her class during covid. Never opened her camera once. The classes comprised of her reading her lecture notes WORD FOR WORD. And she posted these lecture notes on canvas later. Exams are exactly similar to her examples on these notes. All of the classes she teach are either like this OR magically they're taught by this other professor she is related to (not hard to guess for ECEs). So, you end up learning nothing and getting a free A. During my entire 5 years at ECE, I never seen her in real life. She is just a robotic voice for me.\n\nThe problem is she always gets the best reviews on every platform (ratemyprof, CIOS, you name it) because people like 1 - their free As  2 - she is very nice to the point that there is zero rigor in the class. Again, she is a nice person, but a horrible college professor in my opinion. So if you look at metrics, GT sees no problem. To your comment of \" and it\u2019s obvious that some lectures should not be employed here,\" it's common for husband and wive duos to be hired by the same university. So maybe it was a BOGO deal in a way (again, just my theory, i obviously don't have any proof)\n\nIf there is any ECE freshmand/sophmore who is reading this - Please avoid her for anything (circuit analysis, VLSI, etc.) at all costs. Unless you have this silly challenge to try to keep your 4.0 from becoming 3.999 (nobody cares - you'll get a job if you're a good engineer not because you got an A in every course you had), you'll absolutely learn zero thing in her classes. There are 10 minute youtube videos that will educate you more than her entire semester of circuit analysis course.\n\nThere are great professors in ECE that will inspire you and remind you why you actually chose engineering in the first place. They're very rare. However, it is rewarding to find the courses that they teach. Please go find them.",

I went through this last year so I know how it goes\n\nFirst off, if you\u2019re graduating undergrad this semester, know that you can\u2019t register for grad classes until Phase II registration, since you\u2019re a \u201cnew\u201d student again. That means that you\u2019ll have plenty of time to figure out what\u2019s available and what\u2019s filled up. \n\nSecond, if you\u2019re registering as an undergrad, you\u2019ll need level permits to actually be able to register for grad classes. I believe that also opens during Phase II, so you can try to request overrides in advance but they may tell you to wait\n\nLastly, your actual question. I didn\u2019t really struggle getting into any major area classes except for one, but it opened up within the first week of class. Just like undergrad, people will drop classes within the first week of registration and you\u2019ve got a decent chance of getting in. As an undergrad I went for ME 6104 during my last semester and got in just fine\n\nBy the way, not sure how you\u2019re planning your grad school credit hours, but 9 credits in a semester is enough to fill up your time. I did 12 last semester and it took over time from my extra curriculars, so spread it out as much as you can",

The best thing about the book is that it has an entire lecture video series on YouTube by MIT Open Courseware. The lecture series playlist is called \"MIT 18.06SC Linear Algebra, Fall 2011.\"\n\nLoss is an amazing professor and breaks down the content with helpful visualizations. I strongly recommend taking 3406 with him. Homework assignments were given every 1 or 2 weeks and were not time-consuming. His exams were quite similar to the practice exams, and were fair if you went to lecture and did the homework.",

I'm currently taking Chemistry at a community college near my university to fulfill that requirement for computer engineering in fact. \n\nPhysics 1 will count as your lab science elective. \n\nSo because they don't care about +s and -s, only A, B, C, it is a bit hard to get that 3.3 right. To be safe, you'll want at least 2 As and 2 Bs for a solid math/science GPA of 3.5. If you just take Calc 1, 2, and physics then you'll need just 1 A and 2 Bs, it's not too difficult to calculate. \n\nI had a perfect gpa last semester, taking writing, anthropology, calc 2, and two CompSci classes. This semester I have a B in CompSci, and close As in writing 2, calc 3, physics 1, and chemistry.\n\nSo because I got an A in calc 2 last semester, I need at least an A and 2 Bs in calc 3, physics, and chem.\n\nThis is actually making me nervous as well, because they are quite close As and I'm considering dropping Calc 3 because of this so I can get a B in physics and a B in chem and be fine no risks.\n\nAll this to say, the stress never stops lol\n\nBut I think you'll be fine as a math major, dedicate all your time to calc 1 and 2 and physics. Other classes should be less priority but don't let any easy As become Bs. \n\n  \nDid that all make sense or do you need some clarification? I just kind of ranted on and on my fault",

            "selftext": " Hello everyone. I am super relieved to conclude my applications with my top 2 MS ECE admits - UT Austin (Integrated Circuits and Systems Track) and Georgia Tech. I hope you can help me make an informed decision.   \nPost Masters, I plan to join the industry rather than research. And I am slightly inclined towards Physical Design. \n\n* Georgia Tech - Amazing Brand, so great respect for jobs. Great in Physical Design (both Analog and Digital) and Comp. Microarchitecture. I heard an amazing professor who is a legend in Tapeout joined recently.\n* UT Austin - Very affordable tuition fees, access to Teaching Assistantships. Austin is the hub of most semiconductor companies. Good in Digital Physical Design and has access to a large variety of courses.\n\nWhich will be a better school for transitioning to the industry?",

There's very little to no guarantee for most people on which class they TA for even if the professor asks for them (there are some exceptions, but generally this is true).",

However, now that I've finished all my core classes, I only have BME-specific classes which makes me think I'll have a harder time transferring credits.  Is anyone a BME student who studied abroad after taking all of your core classes? For context, I'll be finishing my second year this Spring. ",

But I do. :)\n\nI saw your post a few weeks ago and meant to respond, but got distracted.\n\nIt actually was a coincidence. Elevators are inspected by the State. The inspector canceled and rescheduled with us three times over the course of a few months. They finally came and started their inspections shortly after your post and after many of the certs had expired. It took them a few weeks to complete the initial inspections across campus, and they now need to return to complete follow-up inspections (for example, elevators that were out of order during the initial visit).",

Machine Learning and Computing Systems are by far the largest groups (over half of applicants are ML alone)...so these two groups normally take much longer to review compared to say...Visual Analytics. Both are very close to being finalized I'm told.\n\nSome smaller groups did have their decisions released already as they could be reviewed much quicker. There are still a few large groups that need to be finalized, but everything should be completed any day now. \n\nI know waiting can be suspenseful and anxiety-inducing, but we do appreciate your patience while  decisions are being finalized!",

This parking lot is planned to be replaced with several academic infill buildings (which even have renders) and there are plans to extend state street down to tech parkway through where the Ferst center currently stands as a bus-only cut-through of the campus core (don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re planning on rebuilding it in the new arts district).

Overall I like the direction that the campus is moving, but I do have some concerns regarding that plan. For example, I don't know why they are replacing Peter's parking deck, since to me that was one of the best examples of a good parking deck, with tennis/basketball courts on top of it. I'm also a little concerned with enrollment projection, since tech is already increasing enrollment too fast. I hope they can slow down the rate that the enrollment is increasing and do more improvements on the facilities first.",

Certainly also most of what I described could be done in much less space, though I will note part of why the auto show has moved is because of parking lots being removed. I would guess it could be held on the top of one of the decks though so not a hard fix. Biggest question for me is access to the buildings for equipment moving, as I noted in another comment the lathes and water jet and other things in the Invention Studio and Machining Mall were delivered on large trucks and required heavy equipment to move them. There will be tradeoffs with any plans but looks like GT has been looking at building in this area already so they've probably thought about it pretty thoroughly. More housing and classroom space is needed with enrollment increasing.",

And, if you look back historically to changes that have happened on the campus over the decades, it is clearly trending in a clear direction (like, Tech Green used to be a parking lot. Can you imagine going back to that). So, the leadership of the institute have a clear intent to make more efficient use of space on the campus and want to axe surface lots where possible. \n\nI would say to not be sad about this, but take the bright side and view it as possible room for growth. These lots is as a readily available space to expand when the needs and resources available arise, and the history shows that GT\u2019s leadership is more than open to replacing surface parking lots with new development. As GT continues to grow they can utilize that area to build more of whatever is most pressing (labs, dorms, classrooms, etc).",

This is a living document that's been around since like the 1910s. \n\nIn 2002 the Campus Master Plan states there were 9744 parking spaces. In 2023 the Campus Master Plan states there were 13256 parking spaces. I'm unable to locate the 1997, 1991 or earlier CMPs online tho they are available through GTs archives. \n\n&gt;No pragmatic tradeoffs\n\nThese documents have literally pages dedicated to talking about the strategic plans for parking and why certain decisions are desired. For example - the reduction of surface lots is largely tied to the simple fact that Fulton county (like many cities) have established taxes/fees associated with the amount of sq ft. of impermeable land (including parking lots) that is owned by an organization. This fee is driven by the fact that we use a combined storm water/sanitary sewer system and it is simply becoming overwhelmed. To fix this we needed to raise funds to build a better system/work to reduce the amount of water run off. Hence the tax. These decisions by tech is to... Save money by reducing our tax liability. \n\n&gt;Until it's utterly complete\n\nWhile there may be some folks that believe this.

You can get really absurd with it.\n\n\"Parking\" is a perfectly fine word that everyone understands, and I am suspicious when someone tries to change the wording for no logical reason.  The premise of someone calling parking \"storage\" is that it should be done away with for more immediate use.

I've done research and found that HP students live in seperate dorms and have seperate classes with a small number of students. Will this limit the amount of friends you can make and make your college life bland and boring?\nAlso, I found that the hefner-armstrong dorms have community bathrooms. Is this true for all dorms at Georgia Tech or is it just for these dorms. I really would want to have a dorm with which the bathroom is connected and is just for the use of my roommate and I. \nLastly, I want to ask whether the HP is only for first year students or if it lasts for all 4 years. If it lasts for all 4 years then is it possible to change your dorm building after the first year?\nI know my questions might seem a little dumb but I am an international student who's never visited Georgia or GeorgiaTech so some help would be greatly appreciated. See you all there!",

                    "body": "Hi, HP student here! TLDR: The honors program is worth it and I highly recommend. \n\nTo answer your questions in more details: \n\n1) We all live in Eighth St. Apartments. Freshmen used to live in Hefner-Armstrong, but now everyone lives across the street in 2, 4, or 6 person apartments where everyone gets their own room and there is a bathroom for every pair of two roommates (eg. the 6 person apartments have 3 bathrooms). The dorm style living spaces (which most freshmen live in) do have community bathrooms. I personally think that dorm style living spaces are better for freshmen to meet new people, but you won't be in the honors program and you will have to deal with community bathrooms in those.\n\n2) The honors program classes are optional and the vast majority of the classes we take are not honors program ones. It is cool to have access to that extra resource, but it really doesn't limit us in getting to know more people.\n\n3) You can meet tons of people through events and clubs on campus as well as through housing. There are tons of clubs that are super tight knit and will help you have a vibrant social life. There are hundreds of students in the honors program (roughly 200 a year), and that is where I have met many of my best friends. In my experience, the people I have met through HP have made my college experience far more exciting and you dont need to worry about HP making it bland.\n\n4) The honors program does last for all four years. In the past, students had the option to move elsewhere on campus and stay in the honors program, but now if you want to live on campus and remain in the honors program you have to live in Eighth St. You can still live elsewhere on campus in future years but you would have to leave HP to do so. You can always live off campus in the future and remain in the honors program. As you will find out when you come here, it is really hard to get on campus housing as an upper year. The honors program makes it MUCH easier to get on- campus housing.\n\n5) Other things of note: The honors program isn't perfect. The housing is a HUGE part of the benefit of the program, but you do have to live on West campus. I prefer West to East, but many people who want more parties prefer East. Also, if you are a business or LMC major, most of your classes will be a pretty far walk from West campus. Finally, companies I have worked for have liked seeing the honors program on my resume.",

            "selftext": "As I progress classes for my Computational Media degree, grappling with Data Structures has started to dampened my enthusiasm for coding. Plus, I\u2018m like 99% sure that I\u2019ll get a D in this class. Wouldn\u2019t it look bad if I have to retake the class.? I don\u2019t think coding is the right fit for me... However, I did find myself increasingly drawn to the realm of website and application design as I take other classes. This shift in interests has led me to consider transitioning to the LMC major. Plus, I thought actively participating in clubs like the Design Club or WebDev Club may be more fun and offer me more practical experience compared to continuing with my CS classes. I was contemplating switching to industrial design, but considering graduating a year late and being unable to study abroad at my desired university makes me hesitant to pursue this route. However, I\u2019m considering to minor in it if I switch majors.\n\nNow the main issue I'm grappling with is uncertainty regarding whether obtaining a degree in LMC will notably enhance my chances of success in my future career. May sound like a nonsense but I'm worried how potentialemployers would view me as an LMC major pursuing opportunities in UI design (main) or Web Design\u2026 I feel like they will want more to people with ID/CM degree than a person with LMC degree\u2026 Am I just overthinking too much.?\n\nWill sticking with CM be better or switching to LMC and minoring in Industrial Design would be better and more helpful for UI designer??",

I've worked as a programmer, a QA analyst, did some non-major related work for a few years, and now I've worked as a product manager at my current company for about 4 years. I have objectively been a high performer at every single one of those positions, and I was straight up not a great student. No 4.0 semesters for me, and I had to take more than a couple of classes more than once. Data Structures...let's just say I became VERY familiar with the coursework of that class.\n\nDid that lock me out of a particular set of companies coming right out of college? Yeah, but unless you want to code in isolation all day or get paid the absolute maximum amount of money straight from the start, in hindsight that was a perfectly fine tradeoff for me.\n\nThe question \"What will my employer think of this degree vs CS\" was one that I was also constantly thinking about while going through the coursework. The answer is not a damn thing. Every school has its own little nomenclature for degrees and employers aren't bothered to care about the distinction. They care about the name Georgia Tech.\n\nHonestly, you are going to be 10x more competent than a CS major from 85% of the other schools you're likely to work alongside. Georgia Tech does an amazing job of making you a competent and thoughtful programmer.\n\nIf you love your LMC coursework including the tech-based classes and struggle a little bit with the CS courses, then I would say that you are in the exact right major.\n\nWhat I think I gained from going through the program that my CS brother and sisters do not is what I would call an actual well rounded education.\n\nI am both very technically proficient and also developed great interpersonal and communication skills that I think have done more to get me promoted and raises than any code I could have written.",

You're definitely right to overthink when it comes to this type of topic, but as an LMC major who is doing uiux design and got an internship this summer for design at a relatively well known company, I'd say lmc is not as bad as you think it might be :)\n\nI was a computer science major for my first year and I ended up fully hating it. But ux doesn't *require* coding knowledge so I switched out. But if you want to go into webdev, I'd suggest maybe staying a Cm major. I don't know anything about what goes on in coding classes, but from what everyone else is saying you don't need to be amazing in your cs classes.\n\nI've talked to many advisors recruiters and professionals in the ux design industry and many of them agree that your degree/major is not going to make or break your application. Your projects and portfolio will. This is why participating in clubs that have design positions could help you too.  \n\nFeel free to pm/dm me if you have any questions! I'd be happy to answer them",

I personally love my CM track (media-interaction design) because it's coding with applications in the design part that I'm most interested in.

I think a lot of people consider CS1332 to be one of the harder CS courses (save for 4000-level Networking courses or whatever). I think if you can make it through Data Structures, then you'll be fine. Also, I know several software engineers @ FAANG who have retaken 1332, so you'll probably be fine especially since you want to do UI (UX?) design which doesn't even use data structures.\n2. Plenty of people in the industry aren't CM/ID majors/equivalent. More design-focused majors will give you an advantage in having more projects/coursework that work with design for your portfolio. On the other hand, having a coding background definitely gives you an edge over other candidates because recruiters like to see that you can communicate effectively with the developers on your team. CM is nice because you get 1 thread LMC and 1 thread CS, so it's kind of the best of both worlds. Feel free to minor in ID if you have extra time in your graduation schedule but I don't think it'll make or break anything.\n3. Definitely continue attending Design Club, GT Webdev, etc. Clubs are a great way to gain experience and network. Especially for internships, it shows passion (where you will lack industry experience). Clubs also work on cool projects that you can use for your portfolio. They're also just a great learning resource because IMO there aren't a lot of courses that will help you learn UX (at least when I was a student).",

The fact that she knows a little about the process of turning a Figma design into a working front end website is helpful.

I'm planning on majoring in mechanical engineering.\n\nFor Vanderbilt, I have received a scholarship that covers my tuition. I also got the Davis scholarship at Columbia which would cover about 50k. I haven't received my financial aid package from Georgia Tech or Duke. I have toured Columbia and Georgia Tech and loved both campuses. I plan on visiting Vanderbilt and Duke in next few weeks. I am currently leaning towards Georgia Tech(#5) and Columbia(#17) because they're the better engineering schools according to US News Rankings. I am still open towards Duke and Vanderbilt. Duke (#22) it is well known and has a strong engineering program. Vanderbilt(#42) isn't as good for engineering but it has a good reputation. Is Georgia Tech's engineering education significantly better because of the ranking difference or are top 20 schools about the same? I also wish to know their rankings for mechanical engineering.\n\nI feel like Georgia Tech will prepare me better for engineering but Columbia will have more career opportunities because it's an Ivy and it's in New York. I like Atlanta more than New York but I'm fine with living in New York. I would prefer to have a STEM heavy course load which Georgia Tech has. Columbia would be less STEM heavy because of the \"Core Curriculum\". My main concern is which school will help me get the best/most engineering job offers. The community and environment is another important factor for me. What other factors should I consider?\n\nI appreciate any advice! Thanks!",

GT is top 10 in most engineering fields. Columbia being in NY won't necessarily help with job opportunities in mechanical engineering. \n\nThe *real* question comes down to financial aid. If you're not from GA and you don't have a major scholarship in hand already, you will not get good aid from Tech and you should consider another school. A top school is not worth six figure debt.",

I wish to do a thesis because I want to move on to a PhD and also because of reasons associated with Master's funding. However, I'm having a hard time finding an RA position in high-speed flows and aerodynamics. Most faculty either reply that they don't have funding or worse, don't reply at all. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to find funding before coming to campus? Also, in the AE department how common is it for a Master's student to find funding after your first semester?",

But, the reality has to be spoken, I got rejected from Gatech, but from numerous conversations that I have had with Gatech students , I have come to understand that there is a very good chance of getting funding once you are on campus. So if you are worried about the tuition and fees there is a realistic chance of getting funding.\n\nHowever, as I said before, I know where you're coming from as I myself am trying elentlessely to find an advisor for funding. One piece of information is that professors keep getting projects round the year. The professor you're trying to work with may not have a project right now but may get a project later(maybe in may, jun(maybe). The idea or the strategy is to be persistent! Keep trying, be courteous when asking for an opportunity. I have met some people who managed to get funding before going to the campus, so just hang in there tight!",

If I transfer to GT, I would be paying \\~3K more a year, but I would be able to take more in-depth classes for a biomaterials concentration, and Atlanta is a better location than Charlottesville for job opportunities and internships. MSE is also relatively small at GT, so I'm assuming that it won't be impossible to get research opportunities. Would it be worth it to transfer?",

Is it viable to use UW as a pipeline to jobs in silicon valley as an intl (non-US)? Does working/studying non-stop with basically nothing except winter break kill your uni experience?

However, be mindful that some online classes have in-person exams, albeit very rarely (you can email the prof in advance to registration to make sure it's not the case).\n\nIdk what the difference is for certain, but I'd guess that video is async classes? If that is the case, there are n lecture times and you watch pre-recorded ones and basically it's no different from a Udemy course with a lot of homework. But again, this is my assumption, I've never seen async referred to as video classes. A way to test it if the meeting times are NA.",

One of my worse grades at GT. If you're Intel thread, don't be like me; attend lecture and you'll be fine.\u00a0\n\n\nCS 2050 - ironically enough one of my favorite classes at GT CS classes. Ronnie Howard is goated. Definitely a lot of work but if you camp office hours and take advantage of TAs, getting an A probably won't be too hard.\n\n\nCS 2340 - this class is a joke but an easy A. They improved it this semester but I wish they'd just throw it out entirely and replace it with a 2000 level web or mobile dev class where we're taught development as a focus and object-oriented design/analysis as an aside (semester project has been a JAVAFX app, Android app, and I think now website?) Seems to just test on memorization.\n\n\nCS 2110- another favorite of mine. Learned about circuits, gates, Assembly (not a useful type), C, etc. There's some overlap with 2050 in terms of truth tables, De Morgan's, and what not. I don't think it was particularly hard but I know some people struggle with the class. Think it's way easier compared to implementing and understanding a bunch of algos in AI though.",

I feel like NRE2120 isn't too challenging, but I'm afraid that with the previous pre-reqs of 2 4000-level classes, that the course may be far too difficult.

Adjacent work may help you get your foot in the door for the job that you actually want come graduation. I was able to get my foot in the door with a company through internships in adjacent works to get a job offer in the nuclear space. \n\n  \nYou'll land on your feet, you don't have anything to worry about. I have had several friends that I've graduated with that didn't have internships that got jobs right out of graduation, including in the nuclear world. Just come prepared to interviews with technical examples of how you solved problems (you can get this from your research experience) and you'll be in good shape!",

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm Will.  I'm currently serving as a Senator in the Graduate Student Senate.\n\nAs many of you are aware, SGA has been working to improve our RSO funding policies.  Today, a 72 page document was introduced to the Senate containing many proposed amendments.  I've attached the full document here:\n\n[SGA's Proposed RSO Funding Policy Amendments](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/GeorgiaTechSGA/Ec6M58-7PcNMmRrjr09-ZYABq2746M5t_oH74zlx1uj0Tw?e=3TeoSY)\n\nI specifically would like to call your attention to the proposed amendments in Section 9.6, which **introduces hard caps on the total funding any one RSO could receive in a fiscal year**, Section 14.5, which **allows SGA to retroactively revoke funding that has already been allocated to an RSO**, and Section 4.2.5, which sets aside $75,000 for \"Campus Maintenance and Development\", thereby **reducing the funding available for RSOs**.\n\nThere are many other proposed amendments in the document.  Some (in my opinion) are good, some (in my opinion) are bad, and some are relatively mundane.  I encourage you to read the proposals yourself and come to your own conclusions.\n\nIf you are passionate about RSO funding, I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the proposals under consideration and make your voice heard.  **You can voice your opinion to the Undergraduate House of Representatives tomorrow (April 2) at 7:30 PM in Smithgall 117 (Flag Building).**  Likewise, **you can voice your opinion to the Graduate Student Senate next Monday (April 8) at 11:00 AM in Clary Theater (Bill Moore Success Center).**\n\nOne final note, I know many of the folks who have been involved with developing these amendments.  I KNOW that they are good, well-intentioned people trying to make a bad situation better.  A policy of this magnitude deserves scrutiny and passionate debate.  I am hopeful that any discussions generated by this post remain focused on the policy itself, and not the people involved with trying to fix it.",

                            "body": "This is a vast simplification of the issue, but essentially in 2020 Georgia Tech's lawyers rewrote the SAF funding policies, and removed the ability for SGA to have any discretion over funding decisions.  Every year, many RSOs apply for a budget through SGA.  Under the revised policy, if the total amount of funding requested exceeded the total amount of funding available, all budgets would be cut by a uniform percent such that SGA didn't allocate more money than was available.  Then Covid happened, and RSOs generally weren't requesting funding through SGA anyway, so the SAF reserves grew abnormally large and in the years following covid RSOs grew accustomed to SGA having virtually unlimited funding to distribute.  SGA burned through it's reserves pretty quickly, because under the new policy it literally did not have the authority to deny funding requests if funding was available (and the request complied with RSO policy).  The issue here is that there was nothing stopping an RSO from submitting a request for several hundred thousand dollars (which would never get funded at any other university) and forcing SGA to cut the budgets of all other RSOs to accommodate the exorbitant requests.  This came to a head this year, when the funding requested was more than double the funding available, and therefore all RSOs were looking at over a 50% budget cut.  To help insulate smaller RSOs that are relatively less able to solicit external funding, SGA amended its budget cut formulas to a bracket system, where the portion of a budget request below a certain threshold was reduced at a smaller rate than the portion of a budget request above a certain threshold.  This was viewed by some as \"absolutely shafting\" some large RSOs, but we we're all shafted regardless.",

For a little bit of background, Georgia Tech (and I believe all other USG schools) has a Mandatory Student Fee Advisory Committee (MSFAC).  There are four undergrads, four grad students, and four admin folks that have a vote on the committee.  Every year (except for this year), MSFAC votes to set the level of each mandatory student fee.  Officially, this vote is a \"recommendation\" that is presented to President Cabrera, but in my experience President Cabrera legitimately values student input and, to my knowledge, has always accepted the recommendation of MSFAC.  At that point, President Cabrera officially submits the proposed fee rates to USG, and USG has the final authority to approve or deny the proposed fee rates.  However this year USG threw all of this out the window and mandated that all student fees be recalculated as if part time students paid fees at half the rate of full time students, and online students paid fees at one quarter the full time rate.  MSFAC was told by USG to not request any fee increases this year.  USG is going to look at what the new fees would be under that new system, and vote on potentially moving to something like that, which would shake up the fee level anyone pays.  TL:DR, nobody knows what's happening with fees this year",

Make sure you have a u-lock, as cable locks can be cut very easily, and make sure to lock a part of the frame to the the rack- don't lock just your wheel, seatpost, etc. because those can be removed easily and someone can take the rest of the bike (that's why you might see just a wheel locked to a bike rack). And it's a good idea to [register your bike](https://police.gatech.edu/bicycles-campus) with GTPD in case it needs to be removed for some reason (only lock to racks, not trees, railings, etc.) or get stolen, so they can track you down if they find it. Welcome to campus, it's going to be extra great for biking when the construction (new cycle tracks, etc.) is finished!",

As someone with the same hair texture, I usually find that they don\u2019t really handle the intricacies of it too well just bc there is so much to handle with layers &amp; texture. I usually dump a fuck ton into getting it styled rly damn well now after my many experiences with places like great clips (although that\u2019s just an investment I choose to make). I would suggest tho what the top comment says if u don\u2019t want to spend too much. I\u2019ve seen some hella good hair done by students and it\u2019s p cheap.\n\nAs for performing your normal routine before, it really depends on who is cutting it. I\u2019ve had ppl ask me to not wash it directly before so they can see it\u2019s natural state, or to wash it before bc they r more comfortable with freshly washed hair (like washes 30 mins b4). The consensus seems to be wash b4 although if u regularly see a specific person, ask them. Communication with the stylist is key",

I contacted the insurance provider United Healthcare, and they informed me that pre-existing conditions like Crohn's Disease would be covered under this policy. I am currently on a regiment of Adalimumab injections (fortnightly) and Azathioprine tablets for maintaining my remission, and I wanted help on understanding the process of continuing my treatment here. \n\nI see that there is an option of Humira Copay where I can get my injection for 5$ a month, but I am unclear on how that process goes. Going through the highlights of the insurance plan, I saw that the Out of Pocket Maximum is $6,350 which I assume I would hit quite easily with the frequency of my biologicals, but even that much is a huge amount in medical fees every year.\n\nIs there anyone at Tech with Crohn's disease (or taking the same medication as me) who could guide me with the technicalities of the US Healthcare system? Help would be greatly appreciated. ",

After you pass Piedmont Ave you'll get a crossing to a two-way protected bike lane that will bring you alongside Piedmont Park until you hit the beltline.\n\nIf you bike on the road, just take the whole lane. The traffic isn't too fast in that section ^ because of all the lights\n\nIf you don't want to get on the road, it's technically illegal but it's sometimes safer to get on the sidewalk and go super slow, which I recommend if you're taking the 10th St route crossing the I-85 on-ramp going from campus to midtown. Public safety bikes will also ride on sidewalks so imo it's not a huge deal as long as you yield to pedestrians",

Email not only the head of whatever department, but cc all the chairs of the department + any provost's u think would cover it. If it's something traumatizing, u can ask gt CARE for next steps but they are connected to STAMPS + dean of students. I will say my attempt was frivolous 2/3 of the times i complained\n\nhonestly, just be prepared for the most frustrating bullshit responses from ur teacher and from whoever replies (if they even do). Also know that if a mircale occurs and they escalate, u most likely wont be anonymous",

I am highly considering GaTech's co-op but was wondering if the fact that you are only allowed to work for one company actually be counter-productive since it seems to be risky and very hit or miss and I'm looking to gather as much experience as possible. Is it possible to work a fourth co-op term at a different company after completing the minimum 3 and are there any work arounds for switching co-op jobs if better offers are received. I really like the advantage of being able to work at different times of the year in co-op rather than only being limited to the summer and graduating in 5 years in not an issue for me. Additionally, I would like to know if getting internships and co-ops are hard to get in CS as an intl at Tech as well as if you can/should look for your own jobs outside of what is available on CareerBuzz ( haven't enrolled at Tech yet so unsure exactly of how it works). Lastly, can I expect the pay to be around $16 on the lower end for cs/swe jobs? Thanks so much in advance if you read this and feel free to pm me if you have any advice!",

Within Atlanta, you can expect at least $20/hr as a SWE intern. In west coast tech hubs, it'll be much more, depending on company. I know interns that make the annual equivalent of $120k which is $60/hr.",

            "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm currently facing a challenging situation and I'm reaching out for advice from anyone who has been through something similar or knows the steps I should take.\n\nI was recently informed by Georgia Tech's registrar's office that my Bachelor of Science degree from ETH Zurich doesn't meet their admission criteria for further study (after being admitted into graduate school ~3 month ago). They've stated that I need a \"4-year license or diploma\" from a Swiss institution. However, the Bachelor's degree program at ETH Zurich that I'm enrolled in spans only 3 years, adhering to the Bologna Process standardization. \n\nThis situation is particularly perplexing to me since I had assumed that a bachelor\u2019s degree from ETH Zurich would be sufficient for admission, especially considering that GT accepts 3-year Bachelor's degrees from Germany, which follows the same Bologna Process and that ETH's Bachelor degree is an internationally recognised BSc from a top tier university.\n\nAdding to the confusion, the \"license\" they refer to is typically awarded by vocational schools, and the \"diploma\" is a relic from before the Swiss education system adopted the Bologna system in 1999. ETH Zurich no longer awards these \"diplomas,\" and the standardized bachelor's degree program now is 3 years, not 4.\n\nHas anyone else encountered such an issue with the recognition (or lack thereof) of international degrees by US institutions? I could really use some advice on how to navigate this situation or suggestions on whom to contact within the academic administration to address my case.\n\nAny insights or guidance would be hugely appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "I was admitted to the MS CS program, in Fall 2023. At that time, I was in a fairly comfortable position; working for two years as a software engineer since 2021, and both my parents were earning.\n\nMy mother unfortunately got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in May 2023, around the time I was preparing for my visa process. My father had to resign from his job to care for her, and I deferred my admission to Fall 2024 and continued working in India to be her secondary care giver. She ultimately passed away a few weeks ago.\n\nWe incurred tremendous medical expenses over the last year &amp; insurance barely covered anything. While I have some savings from my own, I cannot rely on my father for funding as he isn't earning right now. Getting a loan is also very hard right now due to lack of any earning co-signer, which is needed by most Indian banks.\n\nAs of now, I'm super confused regarding my MS plans. Gatech is my dream school and i was thrilled to have received an admit from a very competitive pool of candidates.\n\nWhile I understand that there are no outright scholarships for international students at Gatech, I'm wondering if it's possible to secure a GTA/GRA or any other paid work to support my degree. I am aware that we are not supposed to mail professors with unofficial emails (we won't get those before August), is there any way we can reach out right now ? Alternatively, would an online MS be a better option?",

Try going to Europe and Asia where the buildings and streets are much older and there\u2019s small steps and stones everywhere. And just a total lack of parking because 95% of people get by with non-fully accessible public transit.  If you\u2019re that immunocompromised where you can\u2019t muster energy to stand, you really shouldn\u2019t be going outside and there\u2019s tons of virtual participation options.

I don\u2019t know exactly who or what use case you\u2019re advocating for here. A deaf blind neurodivergent paraplegic person who only speaks K\u2019iche and has zero access to internet and caregivers? Who happens to visit GT to present on nuclear engineering? Your mentality of trying to accommodate for 100% of cases is why institutions and governments simply stop providing services for everyone. Because the threat and horror of only providing accommodations for 90% of people. Better 0% than 90%, okay. Cuz the only thing that will make you happy is zero bus service for everyone (equality/inclusion) or personalized mobility devices for everyone (also equity/inclusion). Let\u2019s just make all education virtual and simply shut down the campus. Because a select few people have difficulties with transportation or leaving the home.

I'm comparing the CITY of Atlanta to other CITIES. In Singapore, the ramps are about flush. The front door does not have a ramp bc it's only for entry so it's narrower by design so that the driver can check if people are tapping in. In Tokyo, the main avenues and forms of public transport are extremely accessible (more so than Atlanta, where the sidewalks are death traps for even normal pedestrians given how shit the local drivers are). Many new and administrative buildings are absolutely wheelchair accessible (key word being new, you can't necessarily expect a temple on the top of a hill to demolish its 500 year old historical staircase).\n\nAnd now, again, how did this comment address my points about seating for buses? The buses that largely have a narrow staircase to climb to access and are extremely inaccessible, forcing people who need accommodations to use alternative forms of transportation, often at their own great expense if they have to leave campus.\n\nYou have a huge problem with ignorance.

By the time I realized I had chosen poorly, the state patrol started closing exit ramps. So I couldn't escape at I-75N nor 17th/16th/14th. Now I was funneled into the connector gridlock street party. I eventually made it to the North Avenue exit ramp but was then stuck there for an hour. I had a tiny car, so I managed to hop the sidewalk adjacent to Smith dormitory, and drive backwards down the sidewalk. \n\nI had a wall on one side between me and the dorms, and power poles and a mailbox between me and the North Avenue/Williams Street ramp. So it took a hot minute but I backed down the sidewalk until I got to the Brittain service entrance, turned around, and then drove down Williams Street and onto campus. Once people saw what I had done, others followed behind. \n\nAnd that is how I liberated the North Avenue interstate ramp during Freaknik '94.",

Not to mention that I don't see myself going for any sort of administrative position.\n\nAre all engineers required to get a PE license, or is this actually a less traveled path than I think? For anyone who chose not to do it, how did that affect your career? And is there any advantage in working in more design based fields with a PE license?",

For the PE, I got it because I did pressure vessel design and modification requiring calculations for some state inspection. Also for some states you have to have a PE on staff to offer engineering services in that state. Some even break out SE and all other. Now, you could just hire out the stamping part.They're many companies out there that you can pay for their stamp, some shady. Again, I would tell anyone in the big 2 (CE and ME) to take their FE just cause it is easier right out of school. You got 4 years to decide on doing it.",

You won't necessarily get pigeonholed into administrative jobs, but you will have to be very picky about which positions you accept for the first 10 years of your career as qualifying can often require multiple years of working directly under an already-licensed PE",

For example if you are only designing systems or buildings for a private industry that is only for internal use then a PE is not usually required.",

Regardless, it will be the same pay as a monthly GRA or GTA in the end; HR does that calculation. \n\nFor masters, I am not sure. Becky Wilson should be able to help you figure out the hourly pay but GTA as masters get paid around 1.2-1.3k per month, so I assume the total amount for 80 hours will be like that. But will you really do 20 hrs per week though? Remember you still have to CLOCK in hours if you are a GA and if you are a GTA, you don't need to clock in and you still get paid a monthly stipend.",

In my experience, very few people are super committed to the LLC project/theme (just the way life goes, not the fault of students or profs, but its a theme across majors/years/communities). That said, GC has a huge proportion of OOS/intl compared to the general population (can't speak to other LLCs). Choose whichever fits you best, getting close to profs is cool but its not a gigantic deal. Grand Challenges professors are always available so I wouldn't worry to much about that. Personally I thought the entrepreneurship aspect was cool; I haven't been super passionate about GC itself but the people I've met through it are truly phenomenal and the community itself outside of class is stellar.",

With that being said, there are plenty of other ways to show this, and it is a very minor part of my overall resume. When I first started college, I didn't have as much stuff from GT on my resume, and I think it was mildly helpful for getting the internship after my freshman year. I do want to reiterate that I do not think it will make a big difference though, and the most important part is finding a strong sense of community, (which you can find through plenty of other ways such as clubs, housing, or classes on campus).",

Bits of Good is pleased to announce that with the Fall 2024 and Summer 2024 schedules being released, GT Scheduler is up and ready to help you prepare your schedules with the **new Compare Schedules feature**!\n\nWhile GT Scheduler was originally made so students could optimize the creation of their *own* class schedules, the Compare Schedules feature will now allow users to look at their friends\u2019 schedules from within the GT Scheduler site! Once logged in with a schedule already made, click the \u201cShare Schedule\u201d button located on the right and share your schedule(s) with others by entering their email or copying the link. Email invites will appear in their inbox once sent. On the right panel, turn on the \u201cCompare Schedule\u201d switch and click on your friend\u2019s schedules to compare! Note that this feature **does not work on mobile**.\n\nGT Scheduler has also opened a **donation portal**! In light of growing engineering costs, we are asking for the help of our users to keep GT Scheduler running! These donations will enable us to continue refining our services and providing students with these tools and new features. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a **significant** difference in our ability to maintain and improve GT Scheduler. We at Bits of Good want to thank the GT community for using and supporting our work, and we can\u2019t wait to see how the future of this amazing website unfolds. Happy scheduling!  \n[https://www.gt-scheduler.org/](https://www.gt-scheduler.org/)  \n[https://donorbox.org/gt-scheduler](https://donorbox.org/gt-scheduler)",

(They have done this multiple times, not just this semester)\n\nNot only this, but what is effectively a youtube video and some scribbles of notes every week are mind-numbingly simple for a class that is supposed to be advanced and extremely important to the field of study. \n\nFor the hard part, the simple and logical solution is to go talk to the dean about this. But that is not a good idea as this lecturer is\u2026 close to the dean.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, half of the people in the class are happy about the free A, but I went into this class excited to learn about the subject I want to dedicate my career to. I feel like I\u2019m falling behind everybody else in the field, as the shit we do in this class is just basic circuit analysis that any first semester freshman in ECE can do in their sleep.\n\nIt already doesn\u2019t help that I was promised, and paid massive amounts of money, to take an in person class because I struggle to pay attention in an online format, but even if I do pay attention all I see is RC circuits and plug-and-chug equations.\n\nThis \u201cworld class\u201d engineering program can sometimes be an absolute joke, and it\u2019s obvious that some lectures should not be employed here.\n",

With the field-in-question there is a lot of personal projects you can do to fill your time.\n* If you are a newbie to the field-in-question and dont know what to do, I suggest talking to other people more familiar with the field and can help brainstorm ideas.\n* To facilitate this, join the ECE discord server (http://eced.taboshkas.com/)! The server has a lot of students focusing in the field-in-question (almost disproportionately more than any other ECE focus).

With the field-in-question there is a lot of personal projects you can do to fill your time.\n* If you are a newbie to the field-in-question and dont know what to do, I suggest talking to other people more familiar with the field and can help brainstorm ideas.\n* To facilitate this, join the ECE discord server (http://eced.taboshkas.com/)! The server has a lot of students focusing in the field-in-question (almost disproportionately more than any other ECE focus). Me+other ppl would love to give you a hand and advice.",

On day 1, the prof said that 3043 was your chance to learn circuits again and that's exactly what I did and passed an interview with TI a few weeks later.~~ The class, however, is not very advanced. Many who go deeper into the field view it more as a hurdle to get to the real classes. There are better professors that are teaching the advanced classes in the field. The people I know who are pursuing it as a career will say that interning experience is what actually that propelled them to be successful. The class in question just an unfortunate hurdle that everyone kind of needs to take at the moment. If you want someone to vent or discuss this with my DMs are open. But, I the situation isn't going to really change anytime soon.",

It is the definition of conflict of interest.\n\nI always read reddit but never commented until I saw this. I really feel you. I took her class during covid. Never opened her camera once. The classes comprised of her reading her lecture notes WORD FOR WORD. And she posted these lecture notes on canvas later. Exams are exactly similar to her examples on these notes. All of the classes she teach are either like this OR magically they're taught by this other professor she is related to (not hard to guess for ECEs). So, you end up learning nothing and getting a free A. During my entire 5 years at ECE, I never seen her in real life. She is just a robotic voice for me.\n\nThe problem is she always gets the best reviews on every platform (ratemyprof, CIOS, you name it) because people like 1 - their free As  2 - she is very nice to the point that there is zero rigor in the class. Again, she is a nice person, but a horrible college professor in my opinion. So if you look at metrics, GT sees no problem. To your comment of \" and it\u2019s obvious that some lectures should not be employed here,\" it's common for husband and wive duos to be hired by the same university. So maybe it was a BOGO deal in a way (again, just my theory, i obviously don't have any proof)\n\nIf there is any ECE freshmand/sophmore who is reading this - Please avoid her for anything (circuit analysis, VLSI, etc.) at all costs. Unless you have this silly challenge to try to keep your 4.0 from becoming 3.999 (nobody cares - you'll get a job if you're a good engineer not because you got an A in every course you had), you'll absolutely learn zero thing in her classes. There are 10 minute youtube videos that will educate you more than her entire semester of circuit analysis course.\n\nThere are great professors in ECE that will inspire you and remind you why you actually chose engineering in the first place. They're very rare. However, it is rewarding to find the courses that they teach. Please go find them.",

We maintain a heterogeneous network consisting of Windows, Mac OS, and Linux systems. General computer experience is necessary and additional experience on Windows, Mac, and Linux is a plus. Individuals must be enrolled at Georgia Tech but may be taking a semester without classes.\n\nThis job entails user support, diagnosing hardware, software, and network problems, configuring, installing and maintaining laptops, workstations, and servers, packaging software, and some AV support. Generally we do whatever is necessary to keep people up and running. Some hardware troubleshooting background is of interest, too. The most important quality is a willingness to learn and a commitment to building positive client relationships.\n\nThe level of commitment would be around 10-20 hours per week. Work times are somewhat flexible (business hours needed, no nights or weekends) and the individual must be reliable. Hourly rates are competitive. Work environment is relaxed. \n\n**For potential Web Student Workers:**\n\nThe College of Sciences is looking for part time help with web development. We maintain a variety of sites, primarily using Drupal and Wordpress content management systems. General computer experience is necessary, and a working knowledge of basic web design including:\n\n* HTML\n* CSS\n* Github / version control\n\nis required. Preferred experience includes:\n\n* Javascript (vanilla or any framework)\n* PHP\n* Shell scripting\n\nor prior web design is a plus.\n\nIndividuals must be enrolled at Georgia Tech but may be taking a semester without classes.\n\nThis job entails maintaining existing Drupal and Wordpress sites, handling support tickets, performing CMS updates, formatting new pages and content, creating new sites, and some occasional scripting. The most important quality is a willingness to learn and a commitment to building positive client relationships.\n\nPositions start at $15/hr. for the Summer Semester with potential to continue to work for the organization in the Fall.

                    "body": "Hey, BS/MS ME here! I went through this last year so I know how it goes\n\nFirst off, if you\u2019re graduating undergrad this semester, know that you can\u2019t register for grad classes until Phase II registration, since you\u2019re a \u201cnew\u201d student again. That means that you\u2019ll have plenty of time to figure out what\u2019s available and what\u2019s filled up. \n\nSecond, if you\u2019re registering as an undergrad, you\u2019ll need level permits to actually be able to register for grad classes. I believe that also opens during Phase II, so you can try to request overrides in advance but they may tell you to wait\n\nLastly, your actual question. I didn\u2019t really struggle getting into any major area classes except for one, but it opened up within the first week of class. Just like undergrad, people will drop classes within the first week of registration and you\u2019ve got a decent chance of getting in. As an undergrad I went for ME 6104 during my last semester and got in just fine\n\nBy the way, not sure how you\u2019re planning your grad school credit hours, but 9 credits in a semester is enough to fill up your time. I did 12 last semester and it took over time from my extra curriculars, so spread it out as much as you can",

You should probably do a little bit of review of some basic calculations like determinants, row reductions, and how to find a basis for Null Space, Column Space, and Row space. \n\nI've seen that most people struggle with 1554 because of the time required inside and outside of class, and also the exams sometimes being tough.\n\nFor 3406, Loss uses Gilbert Strang's book, \"Introduction to Linear Algebra.\" (He uses 6th edition but you can find the 4th and 5th editions online for free -- The content is mostly the same). The best thing about the book is that it has an entire lecture video series on YouTube by MIT Open Courseware. The lecture series playlist is called \"MIT 18.06SC Linear Algebra, Fall 2011.\"\n\nLoss is an amazing professor and breaks down the content with helpful visualizations. I strongly recommend taking 3406 with him. Homework assignments were given every 1 or 2 weeks and were not time-consuming. His exams were quite similar to the practice exams, and were fair if you went to lecture and did the homework.",

I'm currently taking Chemistry at a community college near my university to fulfill that requirement for computer engineering in fact. \n\nPhysics 1 will count as your lab science elective. \n\nSo because they don't care about +s and -s, only A, B, C, it is a bit hard to get that 3.3 right. To be safe, you'll want at least 2 As and 2 Bs for a solid math/science GPA of 3.5. If you just take Calc 1, 2, and physics then you'll need just 1 A and 2 Bs, it's not too difficult to calculate. \n\nI had a perfect gpa last semester, taking writing, anthropology, calc 2, and two CompSci classes. This semester I have a B in CompSci, and close As in writing 2, calc 3, physics 1, and chemistry.\n\nSo because I got an A in calc 2 last semester, I need at least an A and 2 Bs in calc 3, physics, and chem.\n\nThis is actually making me nervous as well, because they are quite close As and I'm considering dropping Calc 3 because of this so I can get a B in physics and a B in chem and be fine no risks.\n\nAll this to say, the stress never stops lol\n\nBut I think you'll be fine as a math major, dedicate all your time to calc 1 and 2 and physics. Other classes should be less priority but don't let any easy As become Bs. \n\n  \nDid that all make sense or do you need some clarification? I just kind of ranted on and on my fault",

You're going into it better than I was if that makes you feel better, I thought I was screwed at first because I thought college classes we're for the whole year like they are in high school and thought ut was over for me because I wasn't taking chem haha. Also for chem I recommend an online class, you'll have to come in for labs but the rest of the class you can use chat gpt (use the paid version it's far more accurate for chemistry).",

I hope you can help me make an informed decision.   \nPost Masters, I plan to join the industry rather than research. And I am slightly inclined towards Physical Design. \n\n* Georgia Tech - Amazing Brand, so great respect for jobs. Great in Physical Design (both Analog and Digital) and Comp. Microarchitecture. I heard an amazing professor who is a legend in Tapeout joined recently.\n* UT Austin - Very affordable tuition fees, access to Teaching Assistantships. Austin is the hub of most semiconductor companies. Good in Digital Physical Design and has access to a large variety of courses.\n\nWhich will be a better school for transitioning to the industry?",

There's very little to no guarantee for most people on which class they TA for even if the professor asks for them (there are some exceptions, but generally this is true).",

However, there don't seem many study-abroad opportunities even outside of South Korea for BME students. I wanted to take advantage of the study abroad opportunity, while I still had core classes to take because it would have been easier to transfer those credits. However, now that I've finished all my core classes, I only have BME-specific classes which makes me think I'll have a harder time transferring credits.  Is anyone a BME student who studied abroad after taking all of your core classes? For context, I'll be finishing my second year this Spring. ",

The inspector canceled and rescheduled with us three times over the course of a few months. They finally came and started their inspections shortly after your post and after many of the certs had expired. It took them a few weeks to complete the initial inspections across campus, and they now need to return to complete follow-up inspections (for example, elevators that were out of order during the initial visit).",

This parking lot is planned to be replaced with several academic infill buildings (which even have renders) and there are plans to extend state street down to tech parkway through where the Ferst center currently stands as a bus-only cut-through of the campus core (don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re planning on rebuilding it in the new arts district). I think the read is fascinating and shows how much thought the campus has put until future planning.\u00a0",

Overall I like the direction that the campus is moving, but I do have some concerns regarding that plan. For example, I don't know why they are replacing Peter's parking deck, since to me that was one of the best examples of a good parking deck, with tennis/basketball courts on top of it. I'm also a little concerned with enrollment projection, since tech is already increasing enrollment too fast. I hope they can slow down the rate that the enrollment is increasing and do more improvements on the facilities first.",

Certainly also most of what I described could be done in much less space, though I will note part of why the auto show has moved is because of parking lots being removed. I would guess it could be held on the top of one of the decks though so not a hard fix. Biggest question for me is access to the buildings for equipment moving, as I noted in another comment the lathes and water jet and other things in the Invention Studio and Machining Mall were delivered on large trucks and required heavy equipment to move them. There will be tradeoffs with any plans but looks like GT has been looking at building in this area already so they've probably thought about it pretty thoroughly.

And, if you look back historically to changes that have happened on the campus over the decades, it is clearly trending in a clear direction (like, Tech Green used to be a parking lot. Can you imagine going back to that). So, the leadership of the institute have a clear intent to make more efficient use of space on the campus and want to axe surface lots where possible. \n\nI would say to not be sad about this, but take the bright side and view it as possible room for growth. These lots is as a readily available space to expand when the needs and resources available arise, and the history shows that GT\u2019s leadership is more than open to replacing surface parking lots with new development. As GT continues to grow they can utilize that area to build more of whatever is most pressing (labs, dorms, classrooms, etc).",

I'd be very curious as to the number of parking spots the GT had back in those days vs presently. Tbh I wouldn't be surprised if there are more parking spots now then there were back then. \n\nIn addition we are continuing to grow the number of students and the facilities available on campus.

Go on Historic Aerials or use Google Earth and you'll see a surprising number of large lots that are no longer there across campus.\n\n&gt; Flat lots are just...

Overall, I think parking lots are way-overbuilt and have unacceptably low average usage rates across the country and especially metro Atlanta, but *not* at GT.  I am simply against the \"fewer/no cars\" mindset when no pragmatic tradeoffs are offered.  As I said, those folks will never be satisfied by any level of reduction until it's utterly complete.",

This is a living document that's been around since like the 1910s. \n\nIn 2002 the Campus Master Plan states there were 9744 parking spaces. In 2023 the Campus Master Plan states there were 13256 parking spaces. I'm unable to locate the 1997, 1991 or earlier CMPs online tho they are available through GTs archives. \n\n&gt;No pragmatic tradeoffs\n\nThese documents have literally pages dedicated to talking about the strategic plans for parking and why certain decisions are desired. For example - the reduction of surface lots is largely tied to the simple fact that Fulton county (like many cities) have established taxes/fees associated with the amount of sq ft. of impermeable land (including parking lots) that is owned by an organization. This fee is driven by the fact that we use a combined storm water/sanitary sewer system and it is simply becoming overwhelmed. To fix this we needed to raise funds to build a better system/work to reduce the amount of water run off. Hence the tax. These decisions by tech is to... Save money by reducing our tax liability. \n\n&gt;Until it's utterly complete\n\nWhile there may be some folks that believe this. I think your lumping of all folks who desire a reduction of cars/parking spaces into one monolith is both reductive and unsubstantiated. Do better.",

            "selftext": "Hello guys I'm an international student committed to Georgia Tech for fall 2024 and I have a few questions and queries.I want to know whether applying for HP is a good idea. I've done research and found that HP students live in seperate dorms and have seperate classes with a small number of students. Will this limit the amount of friends you can make and make your college life bland and boring?\nAlso, I found that the hefner-armstrong dorms have community bathrooms. Is this true for all dorms at Georgia Tech or is it just for these dorms. I really would want to have a dorm with which the bathroom is connected and is just for the use of my roommate and I. \nLastly, I want to ask whether the HP is only for first year students or if it lasts for all 4 years. If it lasts for all 4 years then is it possible to change your dorm building after the first year?\nI know my questions might seem a little dumb but I am an international student who's never visited Georgia or GeorgiaTech so some help would be greatly appreciated. See you all there!",

                    "body": "Hi, HP student here! TLDR: The honors program is worth it and I highly recommend. \n\nTo answer your questions in more details: \n\n1) We all live in Eighth St. Apartments. Freshmen used to live in Hefner-Armstrong, but now everyone lives across the street in 2, 4, or 6 person apartments where everyone gets their own room and there is a bathroom for every pair of two roommates (eg. the 6 person apartments have 3 bathrooms). The dorm style living spaces (which most freshmen live in) do have community bathrooms. I personally think that dorm style living spaces are better for freshmen to meet new people, but you won't be in the honors program and you will have to deal with community bathrooms in those.\n\n2) The honors program classes are optional and the vast majority of the classes we take are not honors program ones. It is cool to have access to that extra resource, but it really doesn't limit us in getting to know more people.\n\n3) You can meet tons of people through events and clubs on campus as well as through housing. There are tons of clubs that are super tight knit and will help you have a vibrant social life. There are hundreds of students in the honors program (roughly 200 a year), and that is where I have met many of my best friends. In my experience, the people I have met through HP have made my college experience far more exciting and you dont need to worry about HP making it bland.\n\n4) The honors program does last for all four years. In the past, students had the option to move elsewhere on campus and stay in the honors program, but now if you want to live on campus and remain in the honors program you have to live in Eighth St. You can still live elsewhere on campus in future years but you would have to leave HP to do so. You can always live off campus in the future and remain in the honors program. As you will find out when you come here, it is really hard to get on campus housing as an upper year. The honors program makes it MUCH easier to get on- campus housing.\n\n5) Other things of note: The honors program isn't perfect. The housing is a HUGE part of the benefit of the program, but you do have to live on West campus. I prefer West to East, but many people who want more parties prefer East. Also, if you are a business or LMC major, most of your classes will be a pretty far walk from West campus. Finally, companies I have worked for have liked seeing the honors program on my resume.",

However, I did find myself increasingly drawn to the realm of website and application design as I take other classes. This shift in interests has led me to consider transitioning to the LMC major. Plus, I thought actively participating in clubs like the Design Club or WebDev Club may be more fun and offer me more practical experience compared to continuing with my CS classes. I was contemplating switching to industrial design, but considering graduating a year late and being unable to study abroad at my desired university makes me hesitant to pursue this route. However, I\u2019m considering to minor in it if I switch majors.\n\nNow the main issue I'm grappling with is uncertainty regarding whether obtaining a degree in LMC will notably enhance my chances of success in my future career. May sound like a nonsense but I'm worried how potentialemployers would view me as an LMC major pursuing opportunities in UI design (main) or Web Design\u2026 I feel like they will want more to people with ID/CM degree than a person with LMC degree\u2026 Am I just overthinking too much.?\n\nWill sticking with CM be better or switching to LMC and minoring in Industrial Design would be better and more helpful for UI designer??",

I have objectively been a high performer at every single one of those positions, and I was straight up not a great student. No 4.0 semesters for me, and I had to take more than a couple of classes more than once. Data Structures...let's just say I became VERY familiar with the coursework of that class.\n\nDid that lock me out of a particular set of companies coming right out of college? Yeah, but unless you want to code in isolation all day or get paid the absolute maximum amount of money straight from the start, in hindsight that was a perfectly fine tradeoff for me.\n\nThe question \"What will my employer think of this degree vs CS\" was one that I was also constantly thinking about while going through the coursework. The answer is not a damn thing. Every school has its own little nomenclature for degrees and employers aren't bothered to care about the distinction. They care about the name Georgia Tech.\n\nHonestly, you are going to be 10x more competent than a CS major from 85% of the other schools you're likely to work alongside. Georgia Tech does an amazing job of making you a competent and thoughtful programmer.\n\nIf you love your LMC coursework including the tech-based classes and struggle a little bit with the CS courses, then I would say that you are in the exact right major.\n\nWhat I think I gained from going through the program that my CS brother and sisters do not is what I would call an actual well rounded education.\n\nI am both very technically proficient and also developed great interpersonal and communication skills that I think have done more to get me promoted and raises than any code I could have written.",

You're definitely right to overthink when it comes to this type of topic, but as an LMC major who is doing uiux design and got an internship this summer for design at a relatively well known company, I'd say lmc is not as bad as you think it might be :)\n\nI was a computer science major for my first year and I ended up fully hating it. But ux doesn't *require* coding knowledge so I switched out. But if you want to go into webdev, I'd suggest maybe staying a Cm major. I don't know anything about what goes on in coding classes, but from what everyone else is saying you don't need to be amazing in your cs classes.\n\nI've talked to many advisors recruiters and professionals in the ux design industry and many of them agree that your degree/major is not going to make or break your application. Your projects and portfolio will. This is why participating in clubs that have design positions could help you too.  \n\nFeel free to pm/dm me if you have any questions! I'd be happy to answer them",

Maybe I should postpone my decision after taking additional CS courses to gauge my capabilities lol Thank you for your insights, and I'll likely reach out with further inquiries soon!",

I think a lot of people consider CS1332 to be one of the harder CS courses (save for 4000-level Networking courses or whatever). I think if you can make it through Data Structures, then you'll be fine. Also, I know several software engineers @ FAANG who have retaken 1332, so you'll probably be fine especially since you want to do UI (UX?) design which doesn't even use data structures.\n2. Plenty of people in the industry aren't CM/ID majors/equivalent. More design-focused majors will give you an advantage in having more projects/coursework that work with design for your portfolio. On the other hand, having a coding background definitely gives you an edge over other candidates because recruiters like to see that you can communicate effectively with the developers on your team. CM is nice because you get 1 thread LMC and 1 thread CS, so it's kind of the best of both worlds. Feel free to minor in ID if you have extra time in your graduation schedule but I don't think it'll make or break anything.\n3. Definitely continue attending Design Club, GT Webdev, etc. Clubs are a great way to gain experience and network. Especially for internships, it shows passion (where you will lack industry experience). Clubs also work on cool projects that you can use for your portfolio. They're also just a great learning resource because IMO there aren't a lot of courses that will help you learn UX (at least when I was a student).",

The fact that she knows a little about the process of turning a Figma design into a working front end website is helpful.

But on the other hand, if I do a thesis does that mean I will have to be in a lab over the summer rather than an internship? Since internships are incredibly important to entering industry after graduation, especially with the current market, would pursing an internship over the summer rather than research lead to issues when completing my Masters\u2019 Thesis? \n\nThanks y\u2019all",

I'm planning on majoring in mechanical engineering.\n\nFor Vanderbilt, I have received a scholarship that covers my tuition. I also got the Davis scholarship at Columbia which would cover about 50k. I haven't received my financial aid package from Georgia Tech or Duke. I have toured Columbia and Georgia Tech and loved both campuses. I plan on visiting Vanderbilt and Duke in next few weeks. I am currently leaning towards Georgia Tech(#5) and Columbia(#17) because they're the better engineering schools according to US News Rankings. I am still open towards Duke and Vanderbilt. Duke (#22) it is well known and has a strong engineering program. Vanderbilt(#42) isn't as good for engineering but it has a good reputation. Is Georgia Tech's engineering education significantly better because of the ranking difference or are top 20 schools about the same? I also wish to know their rankings for mechanical engineering.\n\nI feel like Georgia Tech will prepare me better for engineering but Columbia will have more career opportunities because it's an Ivy and it's in New York. I like Atlanta more than New York but I'm fine with living in New York. I would prefer to have a STEM heavy course load which Georgia Tech has. Columbia would be less STEM heavy because of the \"Core Curriculum\". My main concern is which school will help me get the best/most engineering job offers. The community and environment is another important factor for me. What other factors should I consider?\n\nI appreciate any advice! Thanks!",

GT is top 10 in most engineering fields. Columbia being in NY won't necessarily help with job opportunities in mechanical engineering. \n\nThe *real* question comes down to financial aid. If you're not from GA and you don't have a major scholarship in hand already, you will not get good aid from Tech and you should consider another school. A top school is not worth six figure debt.",

So if you are worried about the tuition and fees there is a realistic chance of getting funding.\n\nHowever, as I said before, I know where you're coming from as I myself am trying elentlessely to find an advisor for funding. One piece of information is that professors keep getting projects round the year. The professor you're trying to work with may not have a project right now but may get a project later(maybe in may, jun(maybe). The idea or the strategy is to be persistent! Keep trying, be courteous when asking for an opportunity. I have met some people who managed to get funding before going to the campus, so just hang in there tight!",

If I transfer to GT, I would be paying \\~3K more a year, but I would be able to take more in-depth classes for a biomaterials concentration, and Atlanta is a better location than Charlottesville for job opportunities and internships. MSE is also relatively small at GT, so I'm assuming that it won't be impossible to get research opportunities. Would it be worth it to transfer?",

I am very interested in co-op but also would like a balanced university experience. This does not mean that I am not willing to work hard but I would like to know if the co-op is really worth it or are the stats just inflated by the top performers at UW (silicon valley jobs etc). Is it viable to use UW as a pipeline to jobs in silicon valley as an intl (non-US)? Does working/studying non-stop with basically nothing except winter break kill your uni experience? Is uoft's asip program really that bad and how hard is it to be internship-hunting in Canada on your own (without doing co-op or help from the university board). Lastly, is GTech with co-op a better option for me, especially to get high-paying swe jobs post-grad or is UW co-op going to be significantly better for both Canada and US jobs? Thanks in advance if you read this!\n\nFor more context towards a balanced life and cost: GTech is the cheapest. I have more friends studying in the toronto area than waterloo or atlanta. Atlanta is closest to my home country so its's the fastest and cheapest flight. I have never been to any of these places so I'm not sure where will be the best to spend my undergrad.",

I really like the advantage of being able to work at different times of the year in co-op rather than only being limited to the summer and graduating in 5 years in not an issue for me. Additionally, I would like to know if getting internships and co-ops are hard to get in CS as an intl at Tech as well as if you can/should look for your own jobs outside of what is available on CareerBuzz ( haven't enrolled at Tech yet so unsure exactly of how it works).

If that is the case, there are n lecture times and you watch pre-recorded ones and basically it's no different from a Udemy course with a lot of homework.

One of my worse grades at GT. If you're Intel thread, don't be like me; attend lecture and you'll be fine.\u00a0\n\n\nCS 2050 - ironically enough one of my favorite classes at GT CS classes. Ronnie Howard is goated. Definitely a lot of work but if you camp office hours and take advantage of TAs, getting an A probably won't be too hard.\n\n\nCS 2340 - this class is a joke but an easy A. They improved it this semester but I wish they'd just throw it out entirely and replace it with a 2000 level web or mobile dev class where we're taught development as a focus and object-oriented design/analysis as an aside (semester project has been a JAVAFX app, Android app, and I think now website?) Seems to just test on memorization.\n\n\nCS 2110- another favorite of mine. Learned about circuits, gates, Assembly (not a useful type), C, etc. There's some overlap with 2050 in terms of truth tables, De Morgan's, and what not. I don't think it was particularly hard but I know some people struggle with the class. Think it's way easier compared to implementing and understanding a bunch of algos in AI though.",

Would've preferred a 2000 level mobile app class with some OO-oriented design/analysis aspects over CS 2340 (where the OO-oriented design/analysis is the focus and the semester project you have to essentially self-learn).",

Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of companies that either do nuclear work or operate reactors, so that really tends to be the limiting factor. Adjacent work may help you get your foot in the door for the job that you actually want come graduation. I was able to get my foot in the door with a company through internships in adjacent works to get a job offer in the nuclear space. \n\n  \nYou'll land on your feet, you don't have anything to worry about. I have had several friends that I've graduated with that didn't have internships that got jobs right out of graduation, including in the nuclear world. Just come prepared to interviews with technical examples of how you solved problems (you can get this from your research experience) and you'll be in good shape!",

            "selftext": "Hi, I'm Will.  I'm currently serving as a Senator in the Graduate Student Senate.\n\nAs many of you are aware, SGA has been working to improve our RSO funding policies.  Today, a 72 page document was introduced to the Senate containing many proposed amendments.  I've attached the full document here:\n\n[SGA's Proposed RSO Funding Policy Amendments](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/GeorgiaTechSGA/Ec6M58-7PcNMmRrjr09-ZYABq2746M5t_oH74zlx1uj0Tw?e=3TeoSY)\n\nI specifically would like to call your attention to the proposed amendments in Section 9.6, which **introduces hard caps on the total funding any one RSO could receive in a fiscal year**, Section 14.5, which **allows SGA to retroactively revoke funding that has already been allocated to an RSO**, and Section 4.2.5, which sets aside $75,000 for \"Campus Maintenance and Development\", thereby **reducing the funding available for RSOs**.\n\nThere are many other proposed amendments in the document.  Some (in my opinion) are good, some (in my opinion) are bad, and some are relatively mundane.  I encourage you to read the proposals yourself and come to your own conclusions.\n\nIf you are passionate about RSO funding, I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the proposals under consideration and make your voice heard.  **You can voice your opinion to the Undergraduate House of Representatives tomorrow (April 2) at 7:30 PM in Smithgall 117 (Flag Building).**  Likewise, **you can voice your opinion to the Graduate Student Senate next Monday (April 8) at 11:00 AM in Clary Theater (Bill Moore Success Center).**\n\nOne final note, I know many of the folks who have been involved with developing these amendments.  I KNOW that they are good, well-intentioned people trying to make a bad situation better.  A policy of this magnitude deserves scrutiny and passionate debate.  I am hopeful that any discussions generated by this post remain focused on the policy itself, and not the people involved with trying to fix it.",

We just wanted to provide some more context and digestible information for the proposed changes we are looking to implement.\n\nLast week on Friday, we hosted an RSO Town Hall on our proposed changes where leaders of every RSO listed on Engage were invited to attend. At this town hall, we presented a PowerPoint detailing what SGA has worked on this year to fix finances and create a more sustainable system. You can find a recording of the town hall, the PowerPoint slides, and a Feedback form to express thoughts on our proposals at the links below:  \n[PowerPoint Slides and Recording](https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/cduetemeyer3_gatech_edu/EkT73cm2JsJPhlIZojwib3cBksnrsJTfzjU4JZxGlTJZSQ?e=XZXRNq)  \n[RSO Feedback Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=u5ghSHuuJUuLem1_MvqggyfK4GdHicZHgj_xqBFLC4BUOUxUMVpJRlU0NzRDVEtHRlZLRTBYR0NHRy4u)\n\nPlease feel free to take a look at the proposed changes and provide feedback through the form. SGA wants to make sure we take into account the everyone thoughts and views so that our changes can represent what the entire student body wants.

                            "body": "This is a vast simplification of the issue, but essentially in 2020 Georgia Tech's lawyers rewrote the SAF funding policies, and removed the ability for SGA to have any discretion over funding decisions.  Every year, many RSOs apply for a budget through SGA.  Under the revised policy, if the total amount of funding requested exceeded the total amount of funding available, all budgets would be cut by a uniform percent such that SGA didn't allocate more money than was available.  Then Covid happened, and RSOs generally weren't requesting funding through SGA anyway, so the SAF reserves grew abnormally large and in the years following covid RSOs grew accustomed to SGA having virtually unlimited funding to distribute.  SGA burned through it's reserves pretty quickly, because under the new policy it literally did not have the authority to deny funding requests if funding was available (and the request complied with RSO policy).  The issue here is that there was nothing stopping an RSO from submitting a request for several hundred thousand dollars (which would never get funded at any other university) and forcing SGA to cut the budgets of all other RSOs to accommodate the exorbitant requests.  This came to a head this year, when the funding requested was more than double the funding available, and therefore all RSOs were looking at over a 50% budget cut.  To help insulate smaller RSOs that are relatively less able to solicit external funding, SGA amended its budget cut formulas to a bracket system, where the portion of a budget request below a certain threshold was reduced at a smaller rate than the portion of a budget request above a certain threshold.  This was viewed by some as \"absolutely shafting\" some large RSOs, but we we're all shafted regardless.",

Recently the lawyers have agreed to be removed from the process, hence the flurry of proposed amendments seen here.",

For a little bit of background, Georgia Tech (and I believe all other USG schools) has a Mandatory Student Fee Advisory Committee (MSFAC).  There are four undergrads, four grad students, and four admin folks that have a vote on the committee.  Every year (except for this year), MSFAC votes to set the level of each mandatory student fee.  Officially, this vote is a \"recommendation\" that is presented to President Cabrera, but in my experience President Cabrera legitimately values student input and, to my knowledge, has always accepted the recommendation of MSFAC.  At that point, President Cabrera officially submits the proposed fee rates to USG, and USG has the final authority to approve or deny the proposed fee rates.  However this year USG threw all of this out the window and mandated that all student fees be recalculated as if part time students paid fees at half the rate of full time students, and online students paid fees at one quarter the full time rate.  MSFAC was told by USG to not request any fee increases this year.  USG is going to look at what the new fees would be under that new system, and vote on potentially moving to something like that, which would shake up the fee level anyone pays.  TL:DR, nobody knows what's happening with fees this year",

And it's a good idea to [register your bike](https://police.gatech.edu/bicycles-campus) with GTPD in case it needs to be removed for some reason (only lock to racks, not trees, railings, etc.) or get stolen, so they can track you down if they find it.

I'm not sure the best way to send it to me, but if you pm me, I'll provide my email and maybe I can download it from there. Otherwise, you could comment or pm a link to the video via YouTube or Google Drive.\n\nThis will be used in a public YouTube video, so please be aware of that before sending me something you might not want out there. I'm also happy to credit you if you'd like.\n\nAlso... does anyone happen to know where I can find a higher quality version of this video of Brent Key following the 2022 Duke win?

The technician did not seem to understand at all what I wanted.  She just used a dryer to blow my hair around, and I left with a dry frizzy mop.  I would not want a cut there. \n\nThat was my only encounter ever with a hair cuttery that did not understand how to use a blow dryer to get frizz out.",

As someone with the same hair texture, I usually find that they don\u2019t really handle the intricacies of it too well just bc there is so much to handle with layers &amp; texture. I usually dump a fuck ton into getting it styled rly damn well now after my many experiences with places like great clips (although that\u2019s just an investment I choose to make). I would suggest tho what the top comment says if u don\u2019t want to spend too much. I\u2019ve seen some hella good hair done by students and it\u2019s p cheap.\n\nAs for performing your normal routine before, it really depends on who is cutting it. I\u2019ve had ppl ask me to not wash it directly before so they can see it\u2019s natural state, or to wash it before bc they r more comfortable with freshly washed hair (like washes 30 mins b4). The consensus seems to be wash b4 although if u regularly see a specific person, ask them. Communication with the stylist is key",
