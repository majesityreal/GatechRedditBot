I don\u2019t see why that would be any different than a normal relet, and it\u2019s not like they\u2019re not making a shit ton of profit regardless. I guess they\u2019re looking for more money\u2026\n\nThat happened to me last summer actually. I relet to someone who was coming from out of state for an internship, but he actually got a better internship last minute and had to pawn it off to someone else. It would have been such a shame if he had to pay a whole months rent just to get out of that contract",

This is something along the lines of what I\u2019d expect it takes to become one. \n\nUltimately, it\u2019s extremely selective among a pool of candidates which itself is already extremely selective. But even if you don\u2019t succeed, you will open opportunities for yourself that you wouldn\u2019t have otherwise had by making the effort. You could even get external scholarships that could help you pay your way through college.\n\nBest of luck!",

It's the same with upper division undergraduate classes. An application exists, but most positions are filled via students who talk to the professor. \n\nThere's no single person that does GTA hiring.

Unfortunately, the email made it seem as if this would be counted against me, so I didn't talk to those professors until it was too late. Maybe talking to someone in person doesn't fall under \"do not contact\" but how am I supposed to know that? \n\nI'm not angry that they put that info on the email to intentionally mislead us, because they didn't.

In addition, he's now part of a dance club, goes 1hr to gym everyday (so is tired), is trying to be a part of things like honor society and other societies etc.\n\nThe problem with all this, is that I don't think he's upto it. Last 2 semesters, he registered for 4 courses. That time, he didn't have any of ECs except the gym thing. And he had to drop one course each time because he couldn't handle the load and ended up with bad grades in other 3.\n\nLooks like he hasn't learnt any lesson from the past. Should I tell him he shouldn't overwhelm himself? But its prolly not my place to do that. He's a genuinely nice person so I want to be of help; at the same time we're not really close friends (just have a lot of mutuals so see each other often).\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

That said, you are not in a position to be ordering him to do anything... rather, you are just expressing you care for his well being.  And at the end of the day, you should support him regardless of his decision. It is his decision. And you are his friend.\n\nTo add, every course has different demands on both time and intensity.  So to say that 5 courses is more difficult than 4 different courses... well, more information is needed. But it is worthy of concern.\n\nLastly, during my undergrad, i did a crap-ton of ECs. And frankly, even though they took up a lot of time that i didnt have, they refreshed my mind and soul. Without them, i certainly would have failed and quit before graduating.  However, time/resource management has always been my greatest strength. So i cannot say if he will be equally capable in managing his ECs in a similar position. But maybe.\n\nJust be a good friend to him. Tech is hard on everyone. And best wishes to you also!",

Is that fine or should I wait for the person to finish his sets before getting on the machine myself\n\nWhat about cleanliness? Harder exercises make me sweat quiet a bit. Should I wipe the bench/equipment after use? Or am I expected to wipe before using the said bench/machine? \n\n2. Looking through previous posts it seems that early morning is the best time to avoid bigger crowds. I will have to walk from Tenth and Home to crc (looked up stingerette - this only works till 3:15 am). How safe is it to walk around campus around 5:30 - 6:00 am?\n\n3. Is the GT Barbell club still active? \n\nThanks!!",

Etiquette - simply ask \"Hey, how many sets do you have left?\" when they're resting bt sets (they'll usually offer for you to work in or say their # left) and/or the you can follow up w \"Can I work in with you/y'all?\" if that number isn't ungodly high lol\n\n1a. Pls be a considerate bean and wipe the bench/equipment! Either works, but after is more common so you don't have to wait for cleaner to dry. Wipe stations are around the gym and walls, and we try to keep them stocked at all times. See an empty one? J tell a crc employee. Small towels are also free to all patrons, just go to the desk outside the gym floor to grab one (MI1). \n\n2. Early mornings are def less busy, and it'll be safe (personal preference, but I'd use Atlantic Dr. over State St. to cut into campus sooner). \n\n3. GT Barbell club is still active.",

I wouldn\u2019t recommend focusing on taking the \u201ceasiest\u201d language either, as beginner (and even advanced) language classes at GT should all be pretty easy to get an A in. Also, it\u2019s not about studying hours a day like you mentioned. Language learning is about consistency way more than it is about quantity. You have to allocate time to learn it every day, even on weekends and breaks, if you want to learn efficiently. Of course if all you want is to get an A in a beginner language class, you don\u2019t have to do all that, but it\u2019s up to you whether you want to learn the language only as a semester easy class thing or if you\u2019re actually interested in continuing afterwards and becoming proficient.\n\nInstead, ask yourself what language you actually want to learn. What country\u2019s culture, food, media, etc. interests you the most? Pick that country\u2019s language. If you still have no idea, even consider which language sounds or looks the best to you. \n\nAll language classes at GT are attendance mandatory (I think), so you want to be going to a language class you are actually interested in. If you have the mindset of wanting to learn a language because it\u2019s interesting, I think you\u2019ll have a much better time than if you are learning a language because it\u2019s the \u201ceasiest.\u201d\n\nI went through the Japanese program at GT and made some of the best memories and friends that I have now.

I\u2019m sure others will have a lot more valuable insights to add but here\u2019s mine:\n\n\n- Apply to internships, look on company websites, job sites, Google\n- Apply for summer research experience for undergraduates (REUs), Google [school name] REU or search \u201cREU opportunities summer 2024\u201d\n- Reach out to GT/Emory professors that do interesting research or research that will prepare you with valuable skills for that summer 2025 dream internship/job, ask for opportunity to shadow/participate in their lab (can also do part time class with this)\n- take classes and graduate early (imo graduating early without experience is worse than graduating as scheduled with experience) \n- I did this one summer and I regret it (didn\u2019t really help me with my career), work a summer job at hospitality/retail/service (unless you need money which is understandable and could be rightfully spun in a resume)\n\nMake sure every summer is filled with something that gets you closer to your goal post graduation, whether the goal is getting a job or going to grad/med school, you only get 3 of these summers don\u2019t waste it sitting on the couch\n\nHope that helps, good luck !",

If you buy the annual permit they only accept returns until the end of March. It's a prorated refund but if you need it longer you can't return it, so... the semester is probably ideal for you. Check with them and find out why it's not showing (I think their new platform is glitchy.)\n\nEdit- then again, I don't think the semester permit costs much less than buying the annual permit now and having it till August, so, you might want to check that and just get the annual and keep it. You can ask Parking how much the annual permit costs now, and the semester permit is $400. And, on their website it says you can park after hours in non-residential, non-visitor parking areas, with both the annual and semester permits.",

When I came back, I switched to (and graduated with) Computational Media. \n\n I worked as a Research Scientist at GT for a several years (mostly working in design and software development within Unity3D), getting my grad degree at the same time, slowly. After finishing, I became a UX Researcher and Designer in industry. I\u2019ve worked at five different places in five years since starting that. \n\nBetween my two stints at GT I worked as a film projectionist and movie theatre manager. There is no such thing as useless job experience; You learn something from every job (in that case, corporate politics were completely familiar to me when I entered UX within industry from working at a corporate movie theatre chain). As such, I wouldn\u2019t sweat the first job too much. You just want to be somewhat in the direction you want to go. You get better at picking jobs over time.\n\nI use the thinking and problem solving I learned during my degree work all of the time, though not in ways that you\u2019d be able to point at such as a trade school. GT rewires your brain in ways you don\u2019t appreciate until you start working with people who haven\u2019t had the same benefit (and pain). Limits they perceive are ones you know how to methodically work through from experience. \n\nThat said, it takes time to find a job because so much of it is lucky timing (which you can affect by preparing, networking and keeping your eyes open). The void of that grind never goes away entirely unless you are in a few select specializations. For a while it was trivial for me to switch jobs due to demand for experience in my field, now things have shifted in the other direction for a time. Keep at it and take stock of how you are approaching your search from time to time: repeating the same thing over and over without success usually means you need to adjust something. It\u2019s like solving any problem at Tech, really.",

Even in clubs and stuff I do outside of school I've noticed that lol. Learning how to learn is something we talked a bit about in my classes and my professors pointed out GT's structure kind of nurtures that even if its super rigorous some times.\n\nThank you so much for the input! I'm looking to go into uxui/product design after I graduate and the industry's fluctuation makes me nervous but what you said was really reassuring. \n\nCan I ask if you enjoyed the HCI masters program?

It's a good balance of theory and application (you are required to do a summer internship, there is a required professional development seminar each Fall). I had some practical design experience (meaning you have to compromise depending on the business domain, client and context) which I thought was helpful in getting more out of the theoretical portions. The \"double diamond\" that is often taught in intro HCI classes is rarely how things work in practice. I know some folks who went straight through from undergrad and they seemed to do fine, but personally I'd work for a year or two if I can before entering the program. UX is on a downswing but it will swing back up, the contacts you make via the grad program absolutely help, but it's just doing a lot of side projects and squeezing as much practice as you can from your assignments that get you shovel ready to do the job for real. If you can get a job first I think you'll get more out of it.\n\nIf you want to do the grad program, make some contacts at Tech you can draw on for potential teaching assistantships that can pay your tuition while you are in undergrad (the easiest way to do this is by doing well in classes and making sure your instructors are familiar with you via introductions, etc, TA experience helps a lot in getting those types of funding opportunities).",

Then I realized that wasn\u2019t the career for me, and went back for a second undergrad at tech in materials science, thinking I\u2019d be an r&amp;d engineer. I enjoyed research enough, and also got interested in biotech enough that I then went for a PhD in bioengineering at tech, thinking I\u2019d be a professor. Now that I graduated, I have a great job in entrepreneurial support, sort of like tech transfer. I\u2019d say from my perspective, there\u2019s no rule that says you need to religiously follow what area you studied this far, better to follow your interests as they evolve. Many skills are transferable, and getting a job in a different career often comes down to telling your story effectively to hirers.",

One reason why I can afford to fuck up at GT (doing a Ph.D. and an MSc) is that in the masters at GT, I can manage to mess up and still end up with a B plus I should be focusing more on research and classes are a sideshow. In contrast, my undergrad elsewhere in the US comes with punishment (like maintaining above 3.3 GPA with weed-out classes, etc.) and I was scared to challenge myself.",

Other classes I felt like I learned zero and still passed without much problem, besides a huge stress of knowing I didn't know the material and thinking there was no way I should be able to pass (Statistics with a certain Swiss professor). I also had the experience of trying to take an intro language class (Chinese) cause I needed another class for HOPE and very quickly realizing the only reason the class had a 3.9 GPA was because everyone else in the class grew up speaking Chinese in an immigrant household or people who had taken Chinese for 2-4 years in high school. Some majors have more grade inflation than others, or at the very least, are much easier in general.",

For lunch, their best thing is the taco bar, but it's essentially always the same thing. Typically packed inside and are either missing forks, cups, plates, or both drink machines are out of order. Bathrooms are always clean though. They just put in a pancake machine which is cool. \n\nI've eaten at Brittain twice and both times I've (coincidentally?) gotten sick. It feels like I'm eating in a church, which is what the building is, so take that as you wish. There are less options than Willage it seems but I guess it's good food. No better than Willage.\n\nNav is my absolute favorite. It's a 30 minute walk for me but it's worth it. They are generally always stocked, the options are different and more tasteful. Tons more choices. Breakfast is my fav but everything else is great too. If I had to state a con it would be that the drink machines seem to go out more often than Willage, but still not that much. There is also not much seating for being so close to the apartments. Seating at lunch is hard to label because lunch can range from 11-3 depending on the person.\n\nI'd say hit each once or twice to determine your top choice but Nav does it for me.\n\nEdit: From best to worst (imo), it would go Nav, Willage, Brittain.",

            "selftext": "As a final-semester graduate Machine Learning, Computer Science student, I couldn't enroll in two desired courses and remain on waitlists. These are Deep Learning and Computer Vision. Was hoping to take efficient ML but it filled so fast I settled for CV to have better odds.\n\nHow is it I had the highest registration time slot I will ever have within my time at Gatech, but there are still classes that are not accessible to me? This means I was unable to take these classes during my entire graduate degree despite them teaching fundamental topics to my area of study that 1st semester students can get into and take at peer schools.\n\nI\u2019ve heard of stories with people getting their advisors to move them up waitlists. How does this work? There are other specialization classes I could take to graduate, so my advisor told me to take those, but the ones still open are not relevant to my field or ones I've already taken. For example, they made classes like data visualization count for ML electives despite the fact the class covers databases and visualization and doesn\u2019t teach any ML. This feels like an attempt to loosely classify other classes as being \u201cML\u201d so they can say there are specialization options for us to take and graduate in an attempt to hide that we cannot get into many ML classes despite being enrolled in a ML graduate degree.\n\nGraduate students within ML are specialized in a field of machine learning. Being told we cannot take classes in that specialization area and to take whatever random \"ML\" classes has spot does not make sense for graduate students who wrote their applications talking about the specialization areas of research/learning they want to pursue. We took broad CS classes in undergrad. The point of graduate level work is to specialize.\n\nHopefully I get off the waitlist, but otherwise, this masters program feels like total false advertising of what is truly offered and can be taken. Last semester, I only got into ML classes off of pure luck in phase 2.\n\nHow is there not accountability around this? Looking through reddit, there are posts on this topic every single semester. [Just from 4 months ago:](https://reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/15sdk6u/mscs_whats_with_the_lack_of_varying_classes/)\n\nIs there no oversight?",

Just be glad you're graduating, get out, and try not to think about the classes you *could* have taken (that's what I'm doing) I think they do a good job of making the syllabus public though so I'd use that for the ones you can't get into. Also, yeah the advisors just want to make you believe that everything is fine.",

We pay tuition/fees to take these classes. I'm an incoming BS/MS student starting MS and haven't even got a time ticket but things are full.  GT is a top 5 CS program. Other programs don't seem to have this scale of a problem because they scaled class size and number of classes with admits and GT itself is supporting thousands of student in OMSCS with open classes,  great course options, TAs, ect.  No reason they cannot do the same for on campus students.. They need to add more classes/sections and fix the registration process. There are 2nd year undergrads registered for Deep Learning while graduate students trying to take the class to do research cannot get in. This is negligence.",

Course capacity with CS classes is an issue at a lot of universities right now. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/qm8hfv/eecs_budget_discussion_on_eecs101/) is a link about the situation at Berkeley. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/ual0zo/frustration_with_registration_in_cs_department/) is another link abut the University of Texas. Mind you, both of those places have had MUCH harsher restrictions on the CS major than Tech for far longer. \n\n&gt;GT itself is supporting thousands of student in OMSCS with open classes, great course options, TAs, ect.\n\nWell OMSCS classes are not constrained by physical space. They are sometimes constrained by availability of TAs though. I'm not sure what you're referring to when you mention them.",

Senior and graduate level electives don't normally fill. The UT post you linked even mentions this. For GT, the problem persists up to 3rd/4th year and graduate students trying to get into classes which is really problematic as graduate school is intended to allow you to explore a specialization area. GT's MS program doesn't even feel like a graduate degree with how limited we are in course selection. It feels like a degree mill that is trying to push us into irrelevant classes that technically meet the degree qualifications and give us a graduate degree stamp.\n\nI have friends in MS @ Cal and they all got into Deep Learning there despite them being new students with the lowest registration timeslot.",

A lot of faculty and instructors are already stretched pretty thin.  Hiring instructors is difficult. Hiring faculty is at least an  order of magnitude more challenging.  \n\n\n2) Adjacent to that is the need for TA, etc.  This is an easier problem, but it exists.  \n\n\n3) In-person sections have to have a place to meet. GT has a classroom crunch (A mix  of heavily-booked rooms and rooms that are the wrong sort for courses that need them)   Some proposals have been to extend course start times to 21:00 or 22:00.  Of course, having buildings go off-line for a year at a time to *finally* address long-deferred maintenance issues does not help matters. (#include deferred-maintenance-eventually-takes-longer-and-costs-more.sermon)  \n\n\n4) Not such a concern in CS, but lab space is also under a crunch.   \n\n\n5) While fully-at-a-distance courses might help resolve items  1 and 3, those have some highly problematic conceptual and financial baggage associated with them.  \n\n\nThe off-line buildings coming back online and (of course) Tech Square Phase III will help; however, by the time they all come to pass, we'll probably be back to a break-even point.  \n\n\nGT's growing in amazing ways, but in so doing has painted itself into the proverbial corner.",

                    "body": "\n\nGood evening and Happy Holidays,\n\nPlease read the whole thing as I'll give a glimmer of hope for these courses at the end. But here are a few answers off the top of my head:\n\nML is by far the most popular specialization within the MSCS Program with many students wanting the same select few courses, but there are only so many seats available in any given  course each semester. That's why I always recommend students try to take 1-2 specialization courses each semester as it increases the chances they get to take classes of interest or need over the span of 3 or 4 semesters which is the average amount of time a student completes the MSCS Program.\n\nLet's use Deep Learning as an example, which has 180 seats as of this moment. If 300 students request permits for Deep Learning, some students won't get a permit at all. Some will get the permit and will get the course, some will be able to add themselves to the waitlist if they didn't register in time to secure a seat. Beyond ML, Deep Learning is an elective requirement for multiple specializations, as is Computer Vision -- so it isn't just ML students requesting these courses either. These courses, and a few others, are very popular and in high demand each semester. \n\nOne may think to just offer more sections as a simple solution. I honestly don't know how easy it is to do that. First, we'd have to find a professor willing to teach multiple sections, or to find an entirely different qualified professor to teach a section. Easier said than done. Second, would adding another section sacrifice a different course from being offered in that classroom / time slot?There are only so many buildings with so many classrooms and so many time slots to fit everything in. \n\nA few questions -- How many electives do you technically need to graduate? The reason I ask is often times students will have their specialization requirements entirely satisfied and still request to take more even though they aren't needed for graduation compared to other students. Did you request these courses in your first or second semester when Course Surveys were sent out? Or is this your 3rd or 4th semester and the first time you've ever requested them? If you requested a course each and every semester and never received a permit or couldn't register, I would be frustrated for you, I promise. But if it's your first time asking for them, it may be bad luck you were only able to get on the waitlist for now. \n\nThankfully these courses won't prevent you from fulfilling your degree requirements and graduating. ML is the most flexible specialization in regard to satisfying elective requirements with well over 75 possible electives / elective substitutions. These two courses you listed just happen to be two of the most popular options, so demand is incredibly high. \n\nA glimmer of hope -- you may already know this, but on the final day of registration, which will be Jan 12th, at around 9AM the waitlists will be deactivated for every course. So keep checking on these courses throughout the day to see if a seat becomes available and you can add yourself if so. One class has 180 seats and the other has 250, so I wouldn't be surprised if you were able to secure one or both. \n\nThe registration system at Tech isn't perfect, but it is like this at practically every school. All USG schools use the same system for registration and their students experience frustration at times too. \n\nSorry for such a long explanation, but I wanted to be thorough. Holler if you have any other questions or suggestions on how to improve things.",

If you do a BSMS you have the opportunity to take some graduate classes, decide a PhD is not for you, and still get an MS out of it with less time/effort than you would in the full PhD program where you aren't double counting credits. \n\nTrue, the tradeoff is that you don't get paid - if the stipend is important enough to you, and you are certain you want to do the PhD, then don't do the BSMS.\n\nFrom personal experience though, I'd say the best route is BSMS decide if you want to do the PhD eventually, get into the workforce at a company that encourages further education, and get them to pay for your PhD (while getting full engineer pay). That's not a common opportunity though, I admit.",

The above I got from everyone was \"if you know you want to do the PhD, don't get the masters first\". I was pretty set on a doctorate and a career in research, so I definitely subconsciously assign that mentality to other people when I say the 5 year BSMS is a scam. Also in my field (chemE) and I presume a few different engineering fields, an MS is not that much of a difference maker salary/career wise, especially when it comes to R&amp;D. \n\nI agree your route sounds like the best, but it also doesn't sound realistic in every field. I haven't met too many PhD students sponsored by industry while making full engineer pay. It's a lot more common/feasible to get support through the university/other grants (NSF/DOD/NIH or private companies/foundations), so I wouldn't advise anyone to hold out hope for that. Although my snarky addition to that is \"why waste the time/money on the MS (;\". \n\nIn summary, if there's a reason for it (i.e. you could get significantly more research experience for your PhD app, you aren't sure about research/PhD, you can do it for free...) , BS/MS can be a great option. But if there's no reason, and you can get into your desired PhD program during your senior year, it's not a good thing to do just to say you've done it.",

If you're thinking about ML or related areas (CV, NLP, etc.), you can expect acceptance rates to be sub 10%. That said, a nontrivial portion of rejected applicants come from no-name international undergraduate programs with unknown letter writers and little to no research experience, so as an undergraduate at a top US program you do have a bit of a benefit there.\n\nWhen it comes to rankings, you should really be thinking about how strong a program is in a specific area rather than CS as a whole. For instance, if you want to work in HPC, you might prefer a place like Utah to Carnegie Mellon, since they have more active research in that area. You also should be selecting schools/programs based on faculty rather than rankings. There's no point in applying to a school where the faculty don't fit your research interests (or a place where the only faculty that interest you won't be taking a student for any reason, such as funding issues), as you will just get rejected no matter how qualified you are.\n\nThat said, if you don't already have any research experience, you might have a hard time getting into a school ranked higher than GT, just based off the fact that you may not have a great idea of what you precisely want to do and you may not have a full suite of research-focused letters. It definitely helps to keep your options broad, especially because getting into any PhD program, even a low-ranked one, is not an easy feat.",

Applying to it does not mean you need to take the MS, so you can apply for it and then use it as a safety if you don't get into PhD Programs.\n\nCompetitiveness aside, at this point it would be very hard for you to be sure that you want to do a PhD; a PhD is roughly 6 years of intense research, and if you haven't done research before, you can't be sure that you'd really want to commit to this. Research can be frustrating and very stressful (though IMO it can also be extremely rewarding), so your idea of research may not line up with what work as a graduate student might look like.\n\nIf you can start working on a project this Spring in an area at least vaguely related to what you want to do in a PhD program and you end up liking it, then I would say apply for PhD programs in the fall. You may also want to apply for summer research experiences, though those applications will close in the next few weeks. With regards to application competitiveness, the most important aspect is going to be your letter writers. You ideally want letter writers who are 1) respected in your field (or a closely related one) and who can 2) attest to your ability to conduct research at the level required for a PhD program.",

I had some internships and lots of teaching experience (TA/instructional) but no research experience.  \nI decided to pursue a project-based MS (2 yrs) at GT specifically to build relationships with professors for recommendation letters and get some research experience.  In the end I got 2 recommendation letters from 2 full professors and 1 from an instructor I worked very closely with.  I did not publish anything but the projects were an introduction to the research sphere.  Out of the 7 programs I applied to I got into 2 (1 very good school and 1 backup).\n\nRealistically, admissions to PhD programs is all about recommendation letters (from researchers) and research publications (assuming you meet their minimum academic requirements), and if you don't have either your chances are slim for a good program.  Despite having no research publications, only reason I got into my program was because my current advisor highly respected one of the professors that wrote my letter.\n\nImo, your resume looks competitive for industry but not much for PhD direct entry because it needs research experience and recommendations (unless the work you do is within the research field you're interested in).  I'm not really sure how rigorous the undergrad research is, but if you can get a publication from and work with a professor it that would be great.  If not, i'd talk to professors doing research you're interested in (or his/her PhD students) and try to sit in on lab meetings for exposure to get your foot in the door.  \nYou could go for a Masters at GT to build these experiences up if you don't think you'll get good experience by the end of the undergrad.  GT has a streamlined undergrad-&gt;masters program for CS majors.  You should def look for a GRA or GTA position because that will waive your tuition if you're full-time.",

My current professor is no longer teaching 4400 next sem. For those that were former TAs of 4400, what kind of responsibilities are you assigned? I applied through the TA portal, but didn't get any reply yet. I know a professor that's teaching it next sem, how should I email her asking for potential consideration for being a TA for 4400? Any help/tips are much appreciated.",

They just insisted that they did offer vegan options and to check nutrislice for more information.  They said I could make an appointment with their nutritionist to discuss my problem but I didn\u2019t end up scheduling that. I was on the weekday only plan so I had a lot of dining dollars (400 I think?) that I used most of the time and I ended up getting some of my own groceries for my own sanity.

All of it can move further to being washed away.\n\nThe last time we played UCF, we fired a head coach and an athletic director in the middle of the season.

Lots of extra credit at the end (like 5%+ to final grade) so I wouldn't worry at all about grades unless you somehow bomb a test really bad. The final project is to make a presentation about a well-known theorem/problem related to course topics.\n\nThe class is separated into 6 HWs on the main topics. I'd say I enjoyed about 4/6 of them and very much enjoyed the final presentation. The most boring stuff is right at the beginning where it's mostly just drawing diagrams. The last 30% or so is all about Turing Machines and P/NP complexity classes which I found the most interesting. \n\nOne of the better classes in terms of grading difficulty compared to how much content you learn. Plus if Dr. Galil is teaching he's one of the most distinguished profs at Tech and was the CoC dean like 5 years ago.",

I am trying to plan my semester accordingly and it's kinda hard to say now whether there would be any schedule collisions. \n\nWhen do normally midterms take place? Is it possible sometimes to write midterm earlier/later or make it up somehow? \n\nI am studying MSCS, Computing Systems specialization. ",

            "title": "MATH 1554 was hard. Worried about future classes and GPA for CS grad school admissions",
            "selftext": "This was my first semester at Tech and initially I thought classes were pretty easy. The workload for 17 hours of credit seemed a lot lighter than I expected and the concepts in my classes didn't seem too hard to understand. \n\nThat was until I had my first set of midterms. \n\nI dropped a C on my first MATH 1554 and a low B on my CS 1332 midterm. I was so disappointed in myself. I had hopes of going to a top CS grad school, but I felt like I might lose my chances in my very first semester here since I wasn't even going to start with a 4.0. \n\nSo, for my second round of midterms, I studied my ass off. It was eat, study, gym, sleep on repeat until exam day. I went to office hours, plus sessions, did additional review worksheets, completed both Pearson and Webwork, the whole works.\n\nWhat came of that? I dropped a 98 on my next CS exam. I was so freaking proud of myself, but when I checked my math exam I choked again. I dropped another C. \n\nI understand that I was still passing the class but honestly this was a breaking point for me. I worked so damn hard in MATH 1554 and didn't get the grade I wanted or knew I could get. I thought of myself as a smart, hardworking student, and if I got a B, it would be the first in my life. Linear algebra is so foundational to CS, especially ML and AI. I felt like I needed to master it and get an A in order to have hopes in going to a top grad school.\n\nI tried even harder for my last math midterm (if it was even possible) and got a low B. Finally, not a C, but this meant I needed a 95 for the final in order to get an A. \n\nGiven that I only had one final this semester (I was able to exempt from the CS final), I thought getting a 95 was possible. So, for a whole week straight I did nothing but eat, go to the gym, sleep, and study. I made sure to space out my study session, do all the practice material, study with others, review my mistakes from the midterms, go to office hours, everything I could possibly think of. When I took the final, I thought I did amazing but when I got the grade back, I got an 85 and thus a B in the class.\n\nNow I'm sitting at home wondering if I all my future classes are going to be like this, study really hard and sacrifice a lot of free time to not even succeed in getting an A. From what I heard, Linear Algebra isn't supposed to be that hard of a class but for me I just couldn't seem to execute on the exams. \n\nAs for going to a top grad school, I'm now doubting my capabilities in even getting admission into one because I may or may not have a high enough GPA and couldn't even master an undergrad Linear Algebra course.\n\nI guess my question is, does it get any better from here? What can I do to try to maintain A's from here on out? Any tips in pursuing CS grad schools?\n\nTLDR: Worked my ass of during first semester and didn't get the grade I wanted in MATH 1554. Worrying now about future GPA and grad school admissions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: Sorry if I sound like stupid cry-baby freshman. Just try to get a reality check/reassurance. ",

Many of my former students who struggled with the material, and got grades much lower than yours, went on to do well in the rest of their degree and in their early careers. Some of them definitely use linear algebra in their jobs to this day. \n\nFirst of all, you\u2019ll be okay \u2014 it\u2019s over. Filling in knowledge gaps at your own pace, when nobody is holding you at gunpoint via GPA pressure, is easy. And doing well in a subsequent course that uses linear algebra is all that it takes for any hypothetical (and 100% ridiculous) negative impact of a first-semester B to be cancelled out. \n\nAlso, a single B in *anything* in your first year is flat-out the last thing that will ever make the difference between getting into any kind of graduate program or not. Full stop, you\u2019re way too early to be getting into GPA existential crises. It\u2019s very important to get the best grades you can, but don\u2019t lose sight of the bigger picture.  \n\nAt the same time, yes, it would be healthy to temper your expectations \u2014 not because I think getting a B in 1554 means you should expect a low, mid, or high GPA, but rather because mentally punishing yourself over any grade that\u2019s less than perfect is a terrible approach to higher education. Fixating on that B will hold you back much more than the B itself. You can\u2019t get an existential crisis every time you do your best and don\u2019t get an A, or you\u2019ll be increasingly miserable every time that things don\u2019t work out in the way that you planned them to. Life is full of negative outcomes, both deserved and undeserved ones. \n\nDo whatever you need to do during each semester so that you can walk away from it with peace of mind *before* the transcript comes out. Peace of mind doesn\u2019t have to mean knowing you got all A\u2019s \u2014 it has to mean that no matter what the grades were, you\u2019re in a place where your confidence in your understanding of whatever you learned that semester outweighs whatever grades professors assign to you for the term. \n\nIf you actually do that, not only will your GPA be better than if you obsessed / crunched numbers / lost sleep over it every finals season, but you\u2019ll actually get the most out of your education.

It\u2019s totally okay to be upset and totally normal especially in your first semester at Tech. Especially while taking 17 credit hours! That\u2019s very impressive for anyone and especially someone just trying to adapt to Tech/college for the first time. \n\n2) honestly several of the first year \u201cgeneral\u201d classes are by far the most cut throat. I agree with lots of people above that linear (and I took 1553!) was the hardest math I took at Tech (I\u2019m ME not CS). Between that and physics 2 I thought I was doomed. But even though \u201ccontent\u201d doesn\u2019t get easier, the classes in many ways actually do. The professors care more, the classes get smaller, the content gets more interesting, you adapt studying habits and find friend groups to support you both mentally and socially, and life just gets easier. Not to say you won\u2019t have to work or encounter bumps or even potentially feel this way again next semester, but you can do it. \n\nI know looking at grad school looming can scary but you still have 7 more (probably at minimum) semesters. That\u2019s a ton of time to make up ground if you feel you need to. You are smart. You got into Tech. Never forget that no matter how bleak or hard things seem. It may not be pretty but you can do it. You are not alone. As someone graduating in the spring, I wish I really internalized the idea that all I can do is my best earlier. Sometimes your best in a class will be a B or a C and that is OKAY. I know that doesn\u2019t fix things as someone who is also a perfectionist I have cried over a lot of classes, but you are amazing. You are doing your best. You deserve to be here and are smart enough to chase your dreams and goals and a bad class first semester won\u2019t change that :). Take this thread to heart and hopefully let it encourage you that you are not alone and also totally valid in your feelings.

During the final exam, I spoke to my instructor about my situation of being unsure about graduation and he said I could email him before graduation to find out my grade and if I passed. I needed a D in the class. \nI got his response after the ceremony and saying I fell short of the passing grade. This semester I had a lot of personal circumstances which made it difficult for me to perform well, and I tried to explain it to him. He said he was unable to do anything because this was a coordinated course.\nI emailed the course coordinator with everything and have not received a response. Same with my advisor. \nFinal grades were just posted and I failed by 3 points. \nI have a job secured starting in January and am now in shock.\n\nEDIT: PASSED!",

This created a problem for faculty who had to design two different grading structures and sets of assignments (one with and one without a final).  As a result, the faculty senate protested this around 2000 and had the rules changed where all students had to take finals.\n\nThe school then moved back graduation a week so that grades could be tallied before graduation, but the students complained because they had to spend another week on campus just to wait for graduation.  Meanwhile Housing complained because of the tight turnaround between graduation and the start of Summer semester.  \n\nSo the compromise was that students take finals, walk at graduation, then find out later if they graduated.  \n\nIf you fail, you have to make up the missed credits to graduate.  Contrary to what some believe, you don\u2019t have to walk at graduation to receive a degree.  Many never walk.  The school will just mail your degree.\n\nAs someone mentioned faculty really don\u2019t like to fail seniors because we understand how damaging it can be, for example, if you lose a job.

So if someone is failing a class, they probably know it before official grades are released and probably it's due to personal circumstances and not their ability. So I'd hope in that case that students are talking to their professors about getting some accommodation like taking an incomplete on the course so they can get out without retaking the whole class.",

I'm having trouble deciding between the three and wanted some insight from current/past students for each. Here are the factors I'm looking to consider (ranked out of 10 where 10 is most important and 1 is least important).\n\n1. Location/Weather (3): i'm someone who prefers better/sunnier weather + have family in atlanta for gt, new jersey for jhu, and a close cousin that currently attends unc\n2. Campus (4): how the campus looks and how safety is on campus and even nearby to campus in the city. also want to consider how the dorms are for incoming freshmen\n3. Work-Life Balance (8): i want to have a good work-life balance in college since i wasn't really able to in high school (includes things like sports games, social life, etc.) to clarify, i don't necessarily want a hardcore party school but again one that allows for a good balance. this also includes things like whether the bme workload is so heavy that it completely interferes with social life (i'm willing to work hard but obviously still want to have some fun)\n4. Community (8): whether or not the people in the bme programs are super competitive and cutthroat or more supportive + is it easy to make good friends\n5. Specific Research/Course/Internship Opportunities (10): i'm interested in the tissue/cell engineering and cancer research side of biomedical engineering and want to go to a college that will allow me to explore those fields in courses, labs, and internships. also is it easy to join clubs, labs, etc? i know a lot of people care about rankings and rankings only (gt and jhu are top 2) and that's definitely a good factor for me but i want to know more about how the programs will suit my interests in and beyond college. i'm also unsure how the unc honors and accelerated research program will impact this\n\nPlease let me know if you have any insight and thanks so much :)",

As a prospective bme student interested in tissue engineering/ cancer research - I wanted to understand what changes in the bme department have been made in last 1-2 years that have been positive or negative to the overall bme experience. I'm not clear if closing of the design shop would impact me (given my interest areas).\n\nAfter my Bachelors in BME, I plan to pursue Masters as well. I've read a lot of threads which state that bme bachelor's is not the best to pursue in terms of job prospects - and perhaps CME or ME would be better since they are more in-depth vs BME which is broader. Would that be the case if I pursued a Masters as well?",

This summer I will be heading outside Atlanta for an internship and am looking for someone to sublease my apartment at Theory Interlock located on Northside Drive in West Midtown. It's a new apartment building which opened last fall and is about a 15 minute walk from West Campus. They also have a shuttle which runs from 8am-5pm on weekdays to bring students to campus. The rent for my room will be reduced to $1100/month. I will also only charge for the length of the summer semester (I will pay the remainder of August rent from 8/13 onward when the fall semester starts). The total cost would be $2750 for the whole summer stay from 05/3/24-8/13/24. The room is fully furnished with a bed, mattress, walk-in closet, private bathroom, and a desk with a chair for studying. The whole unit is shared with 2 other bedrooms in the same configuration and includes a common area with a couch, table, TV connected to Roku, a kitchen, and free WiFi with speeds around 150 Mbps. There are many food options right around the corner, including but not limited to Cookout, Chick-fil-A, Burger King, Waffle House and more. There is also a Five Guys restaurant, along with a nail salon (Eleven Nail Bar), Starbucks, and a Sushi restaurant--all located next to the apartment. For grocery shopping, I usually go to Atlantic Station where there is a Publix and Target which is about a 30-minute walk. There is a garage for residents and a parking pass can be purchased for $125/month. Guests can park in the Park Mobile spots for $3/hour in the garage located across from the building with all the restaurants. Please feel free to contact me if you have any other questions! I've also posted a listing on this website which was recommended by the off-campus-housing website and it may help other people who are trying to sublease as well or find other options for housing: [https://www.rentcollegepads.com/off-campus-housing/georgia-tech/subleases](https://www.rentcollegepads.com/off-campus-housing/georgia-tech/subleases)",

I was able to start cognitive neuroscience research in my first semester, without any lab experience beforehand. The research helped me get into a neuroscience REU last summer. \n2. In terms of major courses, I've only finished NEUR 2001 but it's been my favorite class so far. We had a different professor for each unit, which gave us the ability to learn from different teaching styles, and I felt like the exams were very comprehensive, full of examples, and fairly straightforward.\n3. The advisors provide really great advice, especially with creating my 4-year plan and identifying what to do in my summers/gap semesters/gap years. You only have 15 minutes to meet (so have your questions prepared ahead of time!), but you can schedule as many meetings as you want and talk about anything you want.\n\nBest of luck with everything, and PM me if you have additional questions!",

Just go to lite.gatech.edu and check historic GPAs for profs for each class. \n\nA lot of \u201ceasy\u201d classes that people recommend were my (and some of my friends\u2019) greatest headaches because there were assigned readings and essays and such, while we are used to not rly spending much time on classes. So everything really depends on how you think. For example, my personal recommendation for easiest class at Tech is and will always be Statics. If you just understand highschool physics pretty well, then outside of lecture, you will only really need to spend an hour a week on that course. If you don\u2019t really understand basic mechanics though, you\u2019re gonna have problems",

While it is included in the 'cios table template' that faculty have to fill out, there is no comparison whatsoever to other data so it exists in the entire abstract. What, instead, *is* used is what is referred to as 'Item 10'. Item 10 in CIOS is 'considering everything, the instructor was an effective teacher'. Faculty must list responses as well as an interpolated median for each course they teach. For comparative purposes, data is provided by the office of academic effectiveness for all of GT, for each college, and for different course sizes. CIOS scores (not response rate) are the primary evaluation of teacher quality. CIOS isn't a great measure, and this was discussed at the last full faculty meeting - but it is what it is and without other evidence, saying otherwise is pure speculation. Thats not to say faculty aren't encouraged to get their response rate up - its just not at all part of their evaluation. Part of the reason to get response rate up is so that CIOS isn't just filled out by angry students which can skew scores downwards, which might hurt promotion. \n\nHere are the overall GT promotion guidelines:\nhttps://policylibrary.gatech.edu/faculty-handbook/3.3.6-promotion\n\nguidelines specifically for GT College of Engineering:\nhttps://faculty.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/images/rpt_guidance_2022-04-25.pdf\n\nGetting to what you really want:\nhttps://rpt.coe.gatech.edu/promotion-of-tenured-and-tenure-track-faculty/ (see the CIOS section...quoted below)\n\n&gt;Candidate\u2019s Summary of Instruction Opinion Survey (CIOS) \u2013 A summary of all courses taught by the candidate at Georgia Tech must be included in table format along **with normative data for the college and the subject**. If you are seeking promotion to Professor, then the table should only include courses for the last five years per the Faculty Affairs Guidance document to RPT. Refer to the CIOS template for instructions and format.\n\n*Normative data* refers you to data from the office of academic effectiveness: \nhttps://academiceffectiveness.gatech.edu/surveys/cios/norm-data",

We have a ton of clubs that will get you volunteering experience, like Habitats for Humanity, and medicine oriented clubs like Red Cross, AMSA, and one where they get you into hospitals for volunteering (that one you have to apply for), Stamps ambassadors, and a pretty healthy amount of labs that love undergrads to get you your research hours. And we also have a good relationship with Emory - there\u2019s quite a few shared faculty and programs. So it def won\u2019t hurt your application to Emory med school, if you\u2019re interested. There\u2019s also the plus that hospitals like Emory and Grady are within bus/driving/walking I guess but would not recommend it/ect distance. \n\nObviously this is my very biased opinion, but I\u2019d recommend Tech 110%. It\u2019s a great school with resources to prepare you for industry, grad school, or med school.",

                    "body": "One thing a lot of people do not mention about tech that\u2019s a massive benefit gpa wise if you\u2019re aiming for a 4.0 (which you should be if you\u2019re trying to do traditional premed) is that there is no A-. So while getting a B is pretty catastrophic your chances of that actually happening are lower. Everyone I\u2019ve talked to prefers this. \n\nAlso the difficulty of tech especially in non engineering majors is massively overblown. The most difficult classes a premed would take have average GPA\u2019s over 3.2. Which essentially means you don\u2019t even have to be above average to get an A. Definitely some of this is attributable to the better quality of students overall, but honestly it\u2019s really not that bad. And this is only the hardest classes the easier classes are all 3.8+.\n\nIf you are aiming for top tier med schools gt is probably better because research becomes very important, because from a research perspective the schools are really not comparable.\n\nThe culture here is also far more competitive. This is a good and bad thing. A lot of people don\u2019t really understand what it takes to be a competitive applicant. This will definitely not be the case for you as the average student here will be a far more competitive applicant and you will constantly face it and it will make you more motivated to be a better student, but it also causes imposter syndrome and burnout when you see what some of the people here have done before even stepping foot on campus. \n\nIt\u2019s a difficult decision and many people have made it before you. I think the key question is how well do you deal with pressure and how much effort are you willing to put in to go to a truly top tier school. If you don\u2019t deal well with pressure I would go to uga do some summer research and focus primarily on gpa and MCAT and enjoy your life. However, if you are interested in achieving at the highest levels gt provides you with the opportunity to do that.",

            "selftext": "I\u2019m looking to hire an engineering student to take open source plans from the internet and build me either 1 or 2 different types of 3d Filament Extruders.\n\nI\u2019m a big recycler but I hear that my recycles are sent overseas and sometimes dumped into the ocean.\n\nI would love to be able to take the plastics that I accumulate at home, remove the labels from them, clean them and turn them into 3d printing filament so that they can be reused for 3d printing to make household objects.\n\nThe plastics I\u2019m collecting at home are #**1 clear PET, #1 Clear PETE, #5 Black Polypropylene (PP) and #2 white HDPE.** (Yes I've heard HDPE is a tough filament to work with in 3d printing).\n\n* Machine #1 to create PET filament. Example: [\\~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG-U3vSpUnM&amp;t=55s\\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG-U3vSpUnM&amp;t=55s). *Or if you want to go the cheap route, you could always create me the nozzle for the glue gun:* [*\\~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWJW-XOO7A8\\~*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWJW-XOO7A8)\n* Machine #2 to create filament for other plastics. Example: [\\~https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asxP23Jj3p8\\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asxP23Jj3p8) You don\u2019t necessarily have to build the shredder. I can always build that. But I need a machine where I can toss the #2 HDPE shreds or #5 PP shreds (never together) into a funnel, which is then sent through the machine that turns it into 3d printing filament.\n\nIt would be great to be able to tell the machine here is the plastic I\u2019m melting, and it sets the temperature according to which plastic you designate. If that\u2019s too complicated, then just a panel for manually changing temperature will suffice. It\u2019s important that each respective machine is able to get hot enough to reach each plastic\u2019s respective melting temperature. As for millimeter size of filament, 1.75mm seems to be a popular size for filament, so ideally I\u2019d like the machine to produce 1.75mm filament.\n\nHere are a few companies/websites I\u2019ve found that list open source machine plans:\n\n* [https://www.artme-3d.de/produkte/desktop-filament-extruder-mk2/](https://www.artme-3d.de/produkte/desktop-filament-extruder-mk2/)\n* [https://felfil.com/diy-filament-extruder/?v=5ea34fa833a1](https://felfil.com/diy-filament-extruder/?v=5ea34fa833a1)\n* [https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/build/extrusion](https://community.preciousplastic.com/academy/build/extrusion)\n* [~https://www.instructables.com/Build-your-own-3d-printing-filament-factory-Filame/~](https://www.instructables.com/Build-your-own-3d-printing-filament-factory-Filame/)\n* [~https://www.instructables.com/3d-Filament-Extruder/~](https://www.instructables.com/3d-Filament-Extruder/)\n* [~https://www.instructables.com/Manual-bottle-extruder-with-a-solder-iron/~](https://www.instructables.com/Manual-bottle-extruder-with-a-solder-iron/)\n\nPlease build me a quote for how much it would cost (parts and labor), the time it will take to build and the shipping/ebay fees. Because lets face it, most people would be worried about whether they're going to get paid or not over the internet. If you build me a machine and post it to eBay, then that gives both of us a safe way to do a financial transaction.\n\n**BUDGET:** Let me know if you find this reasonable: 25 dollars an hour for 6 hours (which is the suggested build time). That\u2019s $150. And then let\u2019s throw in another 6 hours to research the parts needed online. That\u2019s another $150. That\u2019s $300 so far before parts. As for parts, I\u2019d like you to give me a breakdown of what it\u2019ll cost for all the parts so that I can approve that number. Whether you buy it or I buy it, that can be discussed. And then adding a shipping charge to all of this. If you think the total time estimation is unrealistic, please let me know what is realistic. I\u2019m not\u00a0 part of your world, so I may not understand what it takes to complete a project like this. If people were to tell me that a $300 to $500 price range is ridiculous, then I\u2019ll probably abandon the project and come up with more realistic expectations.",

It doesn\u2019t boil down to research nearly as it does debug of small errors realized during assembly and initial test. I watched the first video you linked, and even just the electronics involved could take a full day or two to really get up and running. Testing and revising takes insane amounts of time.\n\nThe solution is to submit this as a sponsored capstone project. For capstone design projects, groups of up to 6 students of both electrical and mechanical backgrounds could work together for months to put together a project like this, and you would only need to provide the cost of material, which is realistically in your range. The labor that you cannot afford would be instead covered by the grade the students receive on capstone. The only real drawback if you got this submitted, approved, and bidded is the duration you would wait for a team to finish this across a semester. If you word this correctly at all, it is actually a very reasonable submission for a capstone project",

I\u2019m not\u00a0 part of your world, so I may not understand what it takes to complete a project like this.

I could easily build an extrusion recycler for $500 in parts, but that doesn't include the 60-70 hours in Solidworks, purchasing, fabrication, breaking things, re-ordering, rebuilding, testing, failing, rebuilding, and retesting for something that just melts and extrudes plastic. However, you also gave more constraints, specifically that this extruded plastic needs to be 3d-printer compatible. That adds another layer of complexity, because now I need to use components that have even tighter tolerances to ensure they can be reliably fed into printers for re-use, and not clog halfway through a 500g print to create even MORE waste. Add on multi-material constraints and the like, costs add up fast. That's why I had suggested contacting Kendeda earlier if you just want to be sustainable with prints. They already have a process in place and people who know how to do this stuff, which is 90% of the cost. But to set up your own mini-recycling center would require you to incur the full 4-digit cost or more. While the creators you've linked made really good designs, they don't account for all needs you had specified, and they also aren't designed with durability in mind. If you pay me to build something, the expectation from you to me is that it doesn't break down within a week, which I can't guarantee for any of the budget designs you linked.",

You have to take electronics 1 and 2 as well as computational physics, but all of these are electives for the pure physics track. You do get to skip some of the hardest pure physics classes out there, class mech 2, quantum 2, and statistical are all not required classes. There really isn't as much engineering as you may think, certainly there was less than I personally hoped but you can take electives. I'm graduating right now and I love applied physics and at least some of the professors feel it is the better of the two tracks. It can be hard but I managed and I also transferred in so you'll probably be fine. Anyway, I think it rules and everyone should do it and there should be even more lab classes and projects because I think projects are fun.",

Also, join SPS (society of physics students).\n\nDon't worry about the difficulty. Your grades won't matter as much as the variety of classes you've taken and the projects you've participated in. That goes for both industry and grad school.\n\nP.S. whatever you end up doing, 100% take class mech 2. Not being properly introduced to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics is ridiculous.",

You'll immediately join a group of very competent EE's who can help you with hw/studying (you're basically guaranteed to have atleast 1 PI in every EE-specific class you join, in my experience). You also get trained on some cool equipment which is a plus.\n\nUse Course Critique to check the teachers offered for your math/EE courses - in my experience the prof can make all the difference as for how much you learn / how much work a class is.\n\nTake this one with a grain of salt because it's just something that worked for me, but consider picking up an easier minor that you're interested in. I took on a Spanish minor and as a part of that I got 5 A's that boosted my Zell GPA and made staying above that threshold way easier.\n\nJoin a club that lets you test out what you learned in class if possible (e.g. Robojackets, Solar Racing). You learn just as much in those as you do in class! They are time consuming, though.\n\nECE is hard but worth it, in my opinion :)",
