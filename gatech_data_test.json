However, be mindful that some online classes have in-person exams, albeit very rarely (you can email the prof in advance to registration to make sure it's not the case).\n\nIdk what the difference is for certain, but I'd guess that video is async classes? If that is the case, there are n lecture times and you watch pre-recorded ones and basically it's no different from a Udemy course with a lot of homework. But again, this is my assumption, I've never seen async referred to as video classes. A way to test it if the meeting times are NA.",

One of my worse grades at GT. If you're Intel thread, don't be like me; attend lecture and you'll be fine.\u00a0\n\n\nCS 2050 - ironically enough one of my favorite classes at GT CS classes. Ronnie Howard is goated. Definitely a lot of work but if you camp office hours and take advantage of TAs, getting an A probably won't be too hard.\n\n\nCS 2340 - this class is a joke but an easy A. They improved it this semester but I wish they'd just throw it out entirely and replace it with a 2000 level web or mobile dev class where we're taught development as a focus and object-oriented design/analysis as an aside (semester project has been a JAVAFX app, Android app, and I think now website?) Seems to just test on memorization.\n\n\nCS 2110- another favorite of mine. Learned about circuits, gates, Assembly (not a useful type), C, etc. There's some overlap with 2050 in terms of truth tables, De Morgan's, and what not. I don't think it was particularly hard but I know some people struggle with the class. Think it's way easier compared to implementing and understanding a bunch of algos in AI though.",

I'm planning on majoring in mechanical engineering.\n\nFor Vanderbilt, I have received a scholarship that covers my tuition. I also got the Davis scholarship at Columbia which would cover about 50k. I haven't received my financial aid package from Georgia Tech or Duke. I have toured Columbia and Georgia Tech and loved both campuses. I plan on visiting Vanderbilt and Duke in next few weeks. I am currently leaning towards Georgia Tech(#5) and Columbia(#17) because they're the better engineering schools according to US News Rankings. I am still open towards Duke and Vanderbilt. Duke (#22) it is well known and has a strong engineering program. Vanderbilt(#42) isn't as good for engineering but it has a good reputation. Is Georgia Tech's engineering education significantly better because of the ranking difference or are top 20 schools about the same? I also wish to know their rankings for mechanical engineering.\n\nI feel like Georgia Tech will prepare me better for engineering but Columbia will have more career opportunities because it's an Ivy and it's in New York. I like Atlanta more than New York but I'm fine with living in New York. I would prefer to have a STEM heavy course load which Georgia Tech has. Columbia would be less STEM heavy because of the \"Core Curriculum\". My main concern is which school will help me get the best/most engineering job offers. The community and environment is another important factor for me. What other factors should I consider?\n\nI appreciate any advice! Thanks!",

Most faculty either reply that they don't have funding or worse, don't reply at all. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to find funding before coming to campus? Also, in the AE department how common is it for a Master's student to find funding after your first semester?",

But, the reality has to be spoken, I got rejected from Gatech, but from numerous conversations that I have had with Gatech students , I have come to understand that there is a very good chance of getting funding once you are on campus. So if you are worried about the tuition and fees there is a realistic chance of getting funding.\n\nHowever, as I said before, I know where you're coming from as I myself am trying elentlessely to find an advisor for funding. One piece of information is that professors keep getting projects round the year. The professor you're trying to work with may not have a project right now but may get a project later(maybe in may, jun(maybe). The idea or the strategy is to be persistent! Keep trying, be courteous when asking for an opportunity. I have met some people who managed to get funding before going to the campus, so just hang in there tight!",

If I transfer to GT, I would be paying \\~3K more a year, but I would be able to take more in-depth classes for a biomaterials concentration, and Atlanta is a better location than Charlottesville for job opportunities and internships. MSE is also relatively small at GT, so I'm assuming that it won't be impossible to get research opportunities. Would it be worth it to transfer?",

They've done some things that violate the rules at Tech, and I'm just trying to get it all sorted out. I've tried going to my advisor and explaining the situation and they were just like, damn that sucks, that sounds like a you thing to figure out. Who could I talk to that would genuinely care or do something about it?",

Follow that bike lane to Monroe Dr. and you'll end up at the  Piedmont Park entrance of the east side trail.\n\n\nAnd then you'll have several miles of Beltline going all the way to Glenwood Avenue.",

After you pass Piedmont Ave you'll get a crossing to a two-way protected bike lane that will bring you alongside Piedmont Park until you hit the beltline.\n\nIf you bike on the road, just take the whole lane. The traffic isn't too fast in that section ^ because of all the lights\n\nIf you don't want to get on the road, it's technically illegal but it's sometimes safer to get on the sidewalk and go super slow, which I recommend if you're taking the 10th St route crossing the I-85 on-ramp going from campus to midtown. Public safety bikes will also ride on sidewalks so imo it's not a huge deal as long as you yield to pedestrians",

A deaf blind neurodivergent paraplegic person who only speaks K\u2019iche and has zero access to internet and caregivers? Who happens to visit GT to present on nuclear engineering? Your mentality of trying to accommodate for 100% of cases is why institutions and governments simply stop providing services for everyone. Because the threat and horror of only providing accommodations for 90% of people. Better 0% than 90%, okay. Cuz the only thing that will make you happy is zero bus service for everyone (equality/inclusion) or personalized mobility devices for everyone (also equity/inclusion). Let\u2019s just make all education virtual and simply shut down the campus. Because a select few people have difficulties with transportation or leaving the home.

I'm comparing the CITY of Atlanta to other CITIES. In Singapore, the ramps are about flush. The front door does not have a ramp bc it's only for entry so it's narrower by design so that the driver can check if people are tapping in. In Tokyo, the main avenues and forms of public transport are extremely accessible (more so than Atlanta, where the sidewalks are death traps for even normal pedestrians given how shit the local drivers are). Many new and administrative buildings are absolutely wheelchair accessible (key word being new, you can't necessarily expect a temple on the top of a hill to demolish its 500 year old historical staircase).\n\nAnd now, again, how did this comment address my points about seating for buses? The buses that largely have a narrow staircase to climb to access and are extremely inaccessible, forcing people who need accommodations to use alternative forms of transportation, often at their own great expense if they have to leave campus.\n\nYou have a huge problem with ignorance.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm currently facing a challenging situation and I'm reaching out for advice from anyone who has been through something similar or knows the steps I should take.\n\nI was recently informed by Georgia Tech's registrar's office that my Bachelor of Science degree from ETH Zurich doesn't meet their admission criteria for further study (after being admitted into graduate school ~3 month ago). They've stated that I need a \"4-year license or diploma\" from a Swiss institution. However, the Bachelor's degree program at ETH Zurich that I'm enrolled in spans only 3 years, adhering to the Bologna Process standardization. \n\nThis situation is particularly perplexing to me since I had assumed that a bachelor\u2019s degree from ETH Zurich would be sufficient for admission, especially considering that GT accepts 3-year Bachelor's degrees from Germany, which follows the same Bologna Process and that ETH's Bachelor degree is an internationally recognised BSc from a top tier university.\n\nAdding to the confusion, the \"license\" they refer to is typically awarded by vocational schools, and the \"diploma\" is a relic from before the Swiss education system adopted the Bologna system in 1999. ETH Zurich no longer awards these \"diplomas,\" and the standardized bachelor's degree program now is 3 years, not 4.\n\nHas anyone else encountered such an issue with the recognition (or lack thereof) of international degrees by US institutions? I could really use some advice on how to navigate this situation or suggestions on whom to contact within the academic administration to address my case.\n\nAny insights or guidance would be hugely appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

You're at the whims of the admin.\n\nKick up a small storm and see where it gets you. To be fair, the 3-year standard of many engineering universities in Europe is not exactly equivalent to a 4-year bachelor's in the US. That's why at ETHZ you're expected to pursue a Master's, while in the US it's the norm not to.\n\nMaybe see if you can find anyone who went to TU Delft and other similar universities, since they should be in the same situation.",

I am highly considering GaTech's co-op but was wondering if the fact that you are only allowed to work for one company actually be counter-productive since it seems to be risky and very hit or miss and I'm looking to gather as much experience as possible. Is it possible to work a fourth co-op term at a different company after completing the minimum 3 and are there any work arounds for switching co-op jobs if better offers are received. I really like the advantage of being able to work at different times of the year in co-op rather than only being limited to the summer and graduating in 5 years in not an issue for me. Additionally, I would like to know if getting internships and co-ops are hard to get in CS as an intl at Tech as well as if you can/should look for your own jobs outside of what is available on CareerBuzz ( haven't enrolled at Tech yet so unsure exactly of how it works). Lastly, can I expect the pay to be around $16 on the lower end for cs/swe jobs? Thanks so much in advance if you read this and feel free to pm me if you have any advice!",

Internships occur year-round. PLENTY of internships in the fall and spring.\n\n&gt;internships and co-ops are hard to get in CS as an intl at Tech\n\nThere are a couple more [hoops](https://isss.oie.gatech.edu/isss/hiring-international-students-scholars-or-student-interns) to jump though, but international students are hired all the time.\n\n&gt;can I expect the pay to be around $16 on the lower end for cs/swe jobs\n\nDepends on where in the country you go. Within Atlanta, you can expect at least $20/hr as a SWE intern. In west coast tech hubs, it'll be much more, depending on company. I know interns that make the annual equivalent of $120k which is $60/hr.",

        "selftext": "I was admitted to the MS CS program, in Fall 2023. At that time, I was in a fairly comfortable position; working for two years as a software engineer since 2021, and both my parents were earning.\n\nMy mother unfortunately got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in May 2023, around the time I was preparing for my visa process. My father had to resign from his job to care for her, and I deferred my admission to Fall 2024 and continued working in India to be her secondary care giver. She ultimately passed away a few weeks ago.\n\nWe incurred tremendous medical expenses over the last year &amp; insurance barely covered anything. While I have some savings from my own, I cannot rely on my father for funding as he isn't earning right now. Getting a loan is also very hard right now due to lack of any earning co-signer, which is needed by most Indian banks.\n\nAs of now, I'm super confused regarding my MS plans. Gatech is my dream school and i was thrilled to have received an admit from a very competitive pool of candidates.\n\nWhile I understand that there are no outright scholarships for international students at Gatech, I'm wondering if it's possible to secure a GTA/GRA or any other paid work to support my degree. I am aware that we are not supposed to mail professors with unofficial emails (we won't get those before August), is there any way we can reach out right now ? Alternatively, would an online MS be a better option?",

I eventually made it to the North Avenue exit ramp but was then stuck there for an hour. I had a tiny car, so I managed to hop the sidewalk adjacent to Smith dormitory, and drive backwards down the sidewalk. \n\nI had a wall on one side between me and the dorms, and power poles and a mailbox between me and the North Avenue/Williams Street ramp. So it took a hot minute but I backed down the sidewalk until I got to the Brittain service entrance, turned around, and then drove down Williams Street and onto campus. Once people saw what I had done, others followed behind. \n\nAnd that is how I liberated the North Avenue interstate ramp during Freaknik '94.",

Not to mention that I don't see myself going for any sort of administrative position.\n\nAre all engineers required to get a PE license, or is this actually a less traveled path than I think? For anyone who chose not to do it, how did that affect your career? And is there any advantage in working in more design based fields with a PE license?",

Also for some states you have to have a PE on staff to offer engineering services in that state. Some even break out SE and all other. Now, you could just hire out the stamping part.They're many companies out there that you can pay for their stamp, some shady.

This study is directed at college students (undergrad or grad) who are between the ages of 21 &amp; 30 (you do not necessarily need to attend GT). If you meet these criteria, please consider filling out a 5 minute survey at this link - [https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_3aDVErC4x3lHNMq](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3aDVErC4x3lHNMq). \n\nThere is no compensation other than my gratitude lol, but happy to fill out surveys or do a similar request if you DM me re: that. Thanks!",

Regardless, it will be the same pay as a monthly GRA or GTA in the end; HR does that calculation. \n\nFor masters, I am not sure. Becky Wilson should be able to help you figure out the hourly pay but GTA as masters get paid around 1.2-1.3k per month, so I assume the total amount for 80 hours will be like that. But will you really do 20 hrs per week though? Remember you still have to CLOCK in hours if you are a GA and if you are a GTA, you don't need to clock in and you still get paid a monthly stipend.",

In my experience, very few people are super committed to the LLC project/theme (just the way life goes, not the fault of students or profs, but its a theme across majors/years/communities). That said, GC has a huge proportion of OOS/intl compared to the general population (can't speak to other LLCs). Choose whichever fits you best, getting close to profs is cool but its not a gigantic deal. Grand Challenges professors are always available so I wouldn't worry to much about that. Personally I thought the entrepreneurship aspect was cool; I haven't been super passionate about GC itself but the people I've met through it are truly phenomenal and the community itself outside of class is stellar.",

With that being said, there are plenty of other ways to show this, and it is a very minor part of my overall resume.

I do want to reiterate that I do not think it will make a big difference though, and the most important part is finding a strong sense of community, (which you can find through plenty of other ways such as clubs, housing, or classes on campus).",

Bits of Good is pleased to announce that with the Fall 2024 and Summer 2024 schedules being released, GT Scheduler is up and ready to help you prepare your schedules with the **new Compare Schedules feature**!\n\nWhile GT Scheduler was originally made so students could optimize the creation of their *own* class schedules, the Compare Schedules feature will now allow users to look at their friends\u2019 schedules from within the GT Scheduler site! Once logged in with a schedule already made, click the \u201cShare Schedule\u201d button located on the right and share your schedule(s) with others by entering their email or copying the link. Email invites will appear in their inbox once sent. On the right panel, turn on the \u201cCompare Schedule\u201d switch and click on your friend\u2019s schedules to compare! Note that this feature **does not work on mobile**.\n\nGT Scheduler has also opened a **donation portal**! In light of growing engineering costs, we are asking for the help of our users to keep GT Scheduler running! These donations will enable us to continue refining our services and providing students with these tools and new features. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a **significant** difference in our ability to maintain and improve GT Scheduler. We at Bits of Good want to thank the GT community for using and supporting our work, and we can\u2019t wait to see how the future of this amazing website unfolds. Happy scheduling!  \n[https://www.gt-scheduler.org/](https://www.gt-scheduler.org/)  \n[https://donorbox.org/gt-scheduler](https://donorbox.org/gt-scheduler)",

(They have done this multiple times, not just this semester)\n\nNot only this, but what is effectively a youtube video and some scribbles of notes every week are mind-numbingly simple for a class that is supposed to be advanced and extremely important to the field of study. \n\nFor the hard part, the simple and logical solution is to go talk to the dean about this. But that is not a good idea as this lecturer is\u2026 close to the dean.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, half of the people in the class are happy about the free A, but I went into this class excited to learn about the subject I want to dedicate my career to. I feel like I\u2019m falling behind everybody else in the field, as the shit we do in this class is just basic circuit analysis that any first semester freshman in ECE can do in their sleep.\n\nIt already doesn\u2019t help that I was promised, and paid massive amounts of money, to take an in person class because I struggle to pay attention in an online format, but even if I do pay attention all I see is RC circuits and plug-and-chug equations.\n\nThis \u201cworld class\u201d engineering program can sometimes be an absolute joke, and it\u2019s obvious that some lectures should not be employed here.\n",

Many people who take a class with them are doing it for the free A. Edit: ~~However, if you are an EE, you will have the chance to learn and catch up in 3043. On day 1, the prof said that 3043 was your chance to learn circuits again and that's exactly what I did and passed an interview with TI a few weeks later.~~ The class, however, is not very advanced. Many who go deeper into the field view it more as a hurdle to get to the real classes. There are better professors that are teaching the advanced classes in the field. The people I know who are pursuing it as a career will say that interning experience is what actually that propelled them to be successful. The class in question just an unfortunate hurdle that everyone kind of needs to take at the moment. If you want someone to vent or discuss this with my DMs are open. But, I the situation isn't going to really change anytime soon.",

It is the definition of conflict of interest.\n\nI always read reddit but never commented until I saw this. I really feel you. I took her class during covid. Never opened her camera once. The classes comprised of her reading her lecture notes WORD FOR WORD. And she posted these lecture notes on canvas later. Exams are exactly similar to her examples on these notes. All of the classes she teach are either like this OR magically they're taught by this other professor she is related to (not hard to guess for ECEs). So, you end up learning nothing and getting a free A. During my entire 5 years at ECE, I never seen her in real life. She is just a robotic voice for me.\n\nThe problem is she always gets the best reviews on every platform (ratemyprof, CIOS, you name it) because people like 1 - their free As  2 - she is very nice to the point that there is zero rigor in the class. Again, she is a nice person, but a horrible college professor in my opinion. So if you look at metrics, GT sees no problem. To your comment of \" and it\u2019s obvious that some lectures should not be employed here,\" it's common for husband and wive duos to be hired by the same university. So maybe it was a BOGO deal in a way (again, just my theory, i obviously don't have any proof)\n\nIf there is any ECE freshmand/sophmore who is reading this - Please avoid her for anything (circuit analysis, VLSI, etc.) at all costs. Unless you have this silly challenge to try to keep your 4.0 from becoming 3.999 (nobody cares - you'll get a job if you're a good engineer not because you got an A in every course you had), you'll absolutely learn zero thing in her classes. There are 10 minute youtube videos that will educate you more than her entire semester of circuit analysis course.\n\nThere are great professors in ECE that will inspire you and remind you why you actually chose engineering in the first place. They're very rare. However, it is rewarding to find the courses that they teach. Please go find them.",

You should probably do a little bit of review of some basic calculations like determinants, row reductions, and how to find a basis for Null Space, Column Space, and Row space. \n\nI've seen that most people struggle with 1554 because of the time required inside and outside of class, and also the exams sometimes being tough.\n\nFor 3406, Loss uses Gilbert Strang's book, \"Introduction to Linear Algebra.\" (He uses 6th edition but you can find the 4th and 5th editions online for free -- The content is mostly the same). The best thing about the book is that it has an entire lecture video series on YouTube by MIT Open Courseware. The lecture series playlist is called \"MIT 18.06SC Linear Algebra, Fall 2011.\"\n\nLoss is an amazing professor and breaks down the content with helpful visualizations. I strongly recommend taking 3406 with him. Homework assignments were given every 1 or 2 weeks and were not time-consuming. His exams were quite similar to the practice exams, and were fair if you went to lecture and did the homework.",

I\u2019m nervous as I\u2019m walking into it with 3 credits and I need to register for 9 credits of grad credits to keep my scholarship. Would appreciate any insight!",

                "body": "Hey, BS/MS ME here! I went through this last year so I know how it goes\n\nFirst off, if you\u2019re graduating undergrad this semester, know that you can\u2019t register for grad classes until Phase II registration, since you\u2019re a \u201cnew\u201d student again. That means that you\u2019ll have plenty of time to figure out what\u2019s available and what\u2019s filled up. \n\nSecond, if you\u2019re registering as an undergrad, you\u2019ll need level permits to actually be able to register for grad classes. I believe that also opens during Phase II, so you can try to request overrides in advance but they may tell you to wait\n\nLastly, your actual question. I didn\u2019t really struggle getting into any major area classes except for one, but it opened up within the first week of class. Just like undergrad, people will drop classes within the first week of registration and you\u2019ve got a decent chance of getting in. As an undergrad I went for ME 6104 during my last semester and got in just fine\n\nBy the way, not sure how you\u2019re planning your grad school credit hours, but 9 credits in a semester is enough to fill up your time. I did 12 last semester and it took over time from my extra curriculars, so spread it out as much as you can",

This gives me a lot of confidence moving forward as I haven't had to register for many classes in phase 2 so was worried about that part.",

After you become a second year+, you can apply to be in the 3rd floor of Nelson Shell with priority but i think there was even a waitlist for that this year (on campus housing is becoming very competitive at GT). But you can get an on-campus apartment (in principle) without being in an LLC, I guess it gives you a higher chance tho.",

I did Global Leadership my first year and some people found their core friend group from it, and planned and participated in all our community events. If you're worried about meeting others / finding a community LLCs can be nice for that. Matheson and Perry are pretty mid freshman dorms, but they are close to classes on East. Biggest advice for living in the standard dorms: communicate with your roommate and decide boundaries/rules for everything from the start.\n\nMy pros: \n- GL has two really nice lounges for GL only with outdoor, board, and card games\n- free (tho coming from your $800) coffee and snacks in the lounge \n- we had guests visit our lounge for dinner talks from various areas which were good networking opportunities\n- fun outings to get you involved in campus and ATL life (escape room, ropes course, ATL bike tour, Hawks and Atlanta United games, food packing volunteering, looks like the most recent cohort toured NGO Care's office). \n- The involvement and the 1st semester project are things to put on your resume (mine was very blank when I started college). You'll propose a solution to an UN Sustainable Development Goal and write a mock grant application for it. \n\n\nCon: it costs $800 \n\n(in my mind I chose to leave my car at home for 1st year and put that $800 annual parking fee to the GL fee instead). YES it costs you $800 for the school year, but that money comes back to you in the form of planned events (so if you don't attend, them, you kinda are wasting your money).",

Elevators are inspected by the State. The inspector canceled and rescheduled with us three times over the course of a few months. They finally came and started their inspections shortly after your post and after many of the certs had expired. It took them a few weeks to complete the initial inspections across campus, and they now need to return to complete follow-up inspections (for example, elevators that were out of order during the initial visit).",

I hope you can help me make an informed decision.   \nPost Masters, I plan to join the industry rather than research. And I am slightly inclined towards Physical Design. \n\n* Georgia Tech - Amazing Brand, so great respect for jobs. Great in Physical Design (both Analog and Digital) and Comp. Microarchitecture. I heard an amazing professor who is a legend in Tapeout joined recently.\n* UT Austin - Very affordable tuition fees, access to Teaching Assistantships. Austin is the hub of most semiconductor companies. Good in Digital Physical Design and has access to a large variety of courses.\n\nWhich will be a better school for transitioning to the industry?",

Starting next semester I need to start on the CS side of the degree (unfortunately \ud83d\ude14).\n\nI've heard that registering for CS classes as CompE isn't straightforward because of restrictions (a few years ago it was basically impossible for us to get good sections). Has this been fixed yet? I'm trying to get into CS 3251, CS 2340, and CS 3210.",

I'm currently taking Chemistry at a community college near my university to fulfill that requirement for computer engineering in fact. \n\nPhysics 1 will count as your lab science elective. \n\nSo because they don't care about +s and -s, only A, B, C, it is a bit hard to get that 3.3 right. To be safe, you'll want at least 2 As and 2 Bs for a solid math/science GPA of 3.5. If you just take Calc 1, 2, and physics then you'll need just 1 A and 2 Bs, it's not too difficult to calculate. \n\nI had a perfect gpa last semester, taking writing, anthropology, calc 2, and two CompSci classes. This semester I have a B in CompSci, and close As in writing 2, calc 3, physics 1, and chemistry.\n\nSo because I got an A in calc 2 last semester, I need at least an A and 2 Bs in calc 3, physics, and chem.\n\nThis is actually making me nervous as well, because they are quite close As and I'm considering dropping Calc 3 because of this so I can get a B in physics and a B in chem and be fine no risks.\n\nAll this to say, the stress never stops lol\n\nBut I think you'll be fine as a math major, dedicate all your time to calc 1 and 2 and physics. Other classes should be less priority but don't let any easy As become Bs. \n\n  \nDid that all make sense or do you need some clarification? I just kind of ranted on and on my fault",

        "selftext": "Just like the title states, I've been wanting to study abroad in South Korea, specifically Yonsei. However, there don't seem many study-abroad opportunities even outside of South Korea for BME students. I wanted to take advantage of the study abroad opportunity, while I still had core classes to take because it would have been easier to transfer those credits. However, now that I've finished all my core classes, I only have BME-specific classes which makes me think I'll have a harder time transferring credits.  Is anyone a BME student who studied abroad after taking all of your core classes? For context, I'll be finishing my second year this Spring. ",

This parking lot is planned to be replaced with several academic infill buildings (which even have renders) and there are plans to extend state street down to tech parkway through where the Ferst center currently stands as a bus-only cut-through of the campus core (don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re planning on rebuilding it in the new arts district).

I'm also a little concerned with enrollment projection, since tech is already increasing enrollment too fast. I hope they can slow down the rate that the enrollment is increasing and do more improvements on the facilities first.",

Certainly also most of what I described could be done in much less space, though I will note part of why the auto show has moved is because of parking lots being removed. I would guess it could be held on the top of one of the decks though so not a hard fix. Biggest question for me is access to the buildings for equipment moving, as I noted in another comment the lathes and water jet and other things in the Invention Studio and Machining Mall were delivered on large trucks and required heavy equipment to move them. There will be tradeoffs with any plans but looks like GT has been looking at building in this area already so they've probably thought about it pretty thoroughly. More housing and classroom space is needed with enrollment increasing.",

And, if you look back historically to changes that have happened on the campus over the decades, it is clearly trending in a clear direction (like, Tech Green used to be a parking lot. Can you imagine going back to that). So, the leadership of the institute have a clear intent to make more efficient use of space on the campus and want to axe surface lots where possible. \n\nI would say to not be sad about this, but take the bright side and view it as possible room for growth. These lots is as a readily available space to expand when the needs and resources available arise, and the history shows that GT\u2019s leadership is more than open to replacing surface parking lots with new development. As GT continues to grow they can utilize that area to build more of whatever is most pressing (labs, dorms, classrooms, etc).",

In 2023 the Campus Master Plan states there were 13256 parking spaces. I'm unable to locate the 1997, 1991 or earlier CMPs online tho they are available through GTs archives. \n\n&gt;No pragmatic tradeoffs\n\nThese documents have literally pages dedicated to talking about the strategic plans for parking and why certain decisions are desired. For example - the reduction of surface lots is largely tied to the simple fact that Fulton county (like many cities) have established taxes/fees associated with the amount of sq ft. of impermeable land (including parking lots) that is owned by an organization. This fee is driven by the fact that we use a combined storm water/sanitary sewer system and it is simply becoming overwhelmed. To fix this we needed to raise funds to build a better system/work to reduce the amount of water run off. Hence the tax. These decisions by tech is to... Save money by reducing our tax liability. \n\n&gt;Until it's utterly complete\n\nWhile there may be some folks that believe this.

Plus, I\u2018m like 99% sure that I\u2019ll get a D in this class. Wouldn\u2019t it look bad if I have to retake the class.? I don\u2019t think coding is the right fit for me... However, I did find myself increasingly drawn to the realm of website and application design as I take other classes. This shift in interests has led me to consider transitioning to the LMC major. Plus, I thought actively participating in clubs like the Design Club or WebDev Club may be more fun and offer me more practical experience compared to continuing with my CS classes. I was contemplating switching to industrial design, but considering graduating a year late and being unable to study abroad at my desired university makes me hesitant to pursue this route. However, I\u2019m considering to minor in it if I switch majors.\n\nNow the main issue I'm grappling with is uncertainty regarding whether obtaining a degree in LMC will notably enhance my chances of success in my future career. May sound like a nonsense but I'm worried how potentialemployers would view me as an LMC major pursuing opportunities in UI design (main) or Web Design\u2026 I feel like they will want more to people with ID/CM degree than a person with LMC degree\u2026 Am I just overthinking too much.?\n\nWill sticking with CM be better or switching to LMC and minoring in Industrial Design would be better and more helpful for UI designer??",

I've worked as a programmer, a QA analyst, did some non-major related work for a few years, and now I've worked as a product manager at my current company for about 4 years. I have objectively been a high performer at every single one of those positions, and I was straight up not a great student. No 4.0 semesters for me, and I had to take more than a couple of classes more than once. Data Structures...let's just say I became VERY familiar with the coursework of that class.\n\nDid that lock me out of a particular set of companies coming right out of college? Yeah, but unless you want to code in isolation all day or get paid the absolute maximum amount of money straight from the start, in hindsight that was a perfectly fine tradeoff for me.\n\nThe question \"What will my employer think of this degree vs CS\" was one that I was also constantly thinking about while going through the coursework. The answer is not a damn thing. Every school has its own little nomenclature for degrees and employers aren't bothered to care about the distinction. They care about the name Georgia Tech.\n\nHonestly, you are going to be 10x more competent than a CS major from 85% of the other schools you're likely to work alongside. Georgia Tech does an amazing job of making you a competent and thoughtful programmer.\n\nIf you love your LMC coursework including the tech-based classes and struggle a little bit with the CS courses, then I would say that you are in the exact right major.\n\nWhat I think I gained from going through the program that my CS brother and sisters do not is what I would call an actual well rounded education.\n\nI am both very technically proficient and also developed great interpersonal and communication skills that I think have done more to get me promoted and raises than any code I could have written.",

You're definitely right to overthink when it comes to this type of topic, but as an LMC major who is doing uiux design and got an internship this summer for design at a relatively well known company, I'd say lmc is not as bad as you think it might be :)\n\nI was a computer science major for my first year and I ended up fully hating it. But ux doesn't *require* coding knowledge so I switched out. But if you want to go into webdev, I'd suggest maybe staying a Cm major. I don't know anything about what goes on in coding classes, but from what everyone else is saying you don't need to be amazing in your cs classes.\n\nI've talked to many advisors recruiters and professionals in the ux design industry and many of them agree that your degree/major is not going to make or break your application. Your projects and portfolio will. This is why participating in clubs that have design positions could help you too.  \n\nFeel free to pm/dm me if you have any questions! I'd be happy to answer them",

I think a lot of people consider CS1332 to be one of the harder CS courses (save for 4000-level Networking courses or whatever). I think if you can make it through Data Structures, then you'll be fine. Also, I know several software engineers @ FAANG who have retaken 1332, so you'll probably be fine especially since you want to do UI (UX?) design which doesn't even use data structures.\n2. Plenty of people in the industry aren't CM/ID majors/equivalent. More design-focused majors will give you an advantage in having more projects/coursework that work with design for your portfolio. On the other hand, having a coding background definitely gives you an edge over other candidates because recruiters like to see that you can communicate effectively with the developers on your team. CM is nice because you get 1 thread LMC and 1 thread CS, so it's kind of the best of both worlds. Feel free to minor in ID if you have extra time in your graduation schedule but I don't think it'll make or break anything.\n3. Definitely continue attending Design Club, GT Webdev, etc. Clubs are a great way to gain experience and network. Especially for internships, it shows passion (where you will lack industry experience). Clubs also work on cool projects that you can use for your portfolio. They're also just a great learning resource because IMO there aren't a lot of courses that will help you learn UX (at least when I was a student).",

Today, a 72 page document was introduced to the Senate containing many proposed amendments.  I've attached the full document here:\n\n[SGA's Proposed RSO Funding Policy Amendments](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/GeorgiaTechSGA/Ec6M58-7PcNMmRrjr09-ZYABq2746M5t_oH74zlx1uj0Tw?e=3TeoSY)\n\nI specifically would like to call your attention to the proposed amendments in Section 9.6, which **introduces hard caps on the total funding any one RSO could receive in a fiscal year**, Section 14.5, which **allows SGA to retroactively revoke funding that has already been allocated to an RSO**, and Section 4.2.5, which sets aside $75,000 for \"Campus Maintenance and Development\", thereby **reducing the funding available for RSOs**.\n\nThere are many other proposed amendments in the document.  Some (in my opinion) are good, some (in my opinion) are bad, and some are relatively mundane.  I encourage you to read the proposals yourself and come to your own conclusions.\n\nIf you are passionate about RSO funding, I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the proposals under consideration and make your voice heard.  **You can voice your opinion to the Undergraduate House of Representatives tomorrow (April 2) at 7:30 PM in Smithgall 117 (Flag Building).**  Likewise, **you can voice your opinion to the Graduate Student Senate next Monday (April 8) at 11:00 AM in Clary Theater (Bill Moore Success Center).**\n\nOne final note, I know many of the folks who have been involved with developing these amendments.  I KNOW that they are good, well-intentioned people trying to make a bad situation better.  A policy of this magnitude deserves scrutiny and passionate debate.  I am hopeful that any discussions generated by this post remain focused on the policy itself, and not the people involved with trying to fix it.",

                        "body": "This is a vast simplification of the issue, but essentially in 2020 Georgia Tech's lawyers rewrote the SAF funding policies, and removed the ability for SGA to have any discretion over funding decisions.  Every year, many RSOs apply for a budget through SGA.  Under the revised policy, if the total amount of funding requested exceeded the total amount of funding available, all budgets would be cut by a uniform percent such that SGA didn't allocate more money than was available.  Then Covid happened, and RSOs generally weren't requesting funding through SGA anyway, so the SAF reserves grew abnormally large and in the years following covid RSOs grew accustomed to SGA having virtually unlimited funding to distribute.  SGA burned through it's reserves pretty quickly, because under the new policy it literally did not have the authority to deny funding requests if funding was available (and the request complied with RSO policy).  The issue here is that there was nothing stopping an RSO from submitting a request for several hundred thousand dollars (which would never get funded at any other university) and forcing SGA to cut the budgets of all other RSOs to accommodate the exorbitant requests.  This came to a head this year, when the funding requested was more than double the funding available, and therefore all RSOs were looking at over a 50% budget cut.  To help insulate smaller RSOs that are relatively less able to solicit external funding, SGA amended its budget cut formulas to a bracket system, where the portion of a budget request below a certain threshold was reduced at a smaller rate than the portion of a budget request above a certain threshold.  This was viewed by some as \"absolutely shafting\" some large RSOs, but we we're all shafted regardless.",

Recently the lawyers have agreed to be removed from the process, hence the flurry of proposed amendments seen here.",

                        "body": "This is a fascinating point.  For a little bit of background, Georgia Tech (and I believe all other USG schools) has a Mandatory Student Fee Advisory Committee (MSFAC).  There are four undergrads, four grad students, and four admin folks that have a vote on the committee.  Every year (except for this year), MSFAC votes to set the level of each mandatory student fee.  Officially, this vote is a \"recommendation\" that is presented to President Cabrera, but in my experience President Cabrera legitimately values student input and, to my knowledge, has always accepted the recommendation of MSFAC.  At that point, President Cabrera officially submits the proposed fee rates to USG, and USG has the final authority to approve or deny the proposed fee rates.  However this year USG threw all of this out the window and mandated that all student fees be recalculated as if part time students paid fees at half the rate of full time students, and online students paid fees at one quarter the full time rate.  MSFAC was told by USG to not request any fee increases this year.  USG is going to look at what the new fees would be under that new system, and vote on potentially moving to something like that, which would shake up the fee level anyone pays.  TL:DR, nobody knows what's happening with fees this year",

I've done research and found that HP students live in seperate dorms and have seperate classes with a small number of students. Will this limit the amount of friends you can make and make your college life bland and boring?\nAlso, I found that the hefner-armstrong dorms have community bathrooms. Is this true for all dorms at Georgia Tech or is it just for these dorms. I really would want to have a dorm with which the bathroom is connected and is just for the use of my roommate and I. \nLastly, I want to ask whether the HP is only for first year students or if it lasts for all 4 years. If it lasts for all 4 years then is it possible to change your dorm building after the first year?\nI know my questions might seem a little dumb but I am an international student who's never visited Georgia or GeorgiaTech so some help would be greatly appreciated. See you all there!",

                "body": "Hi, HP student here! TLDR: The honors program is worth it and I highly recommend. \n\nTo answer your questions in more details: \n\n1) We all live in Eighth St. Apartments. Freshmen used to live in Hefner-Armstrong, but now everyone lives across the street in 2, 4, or 6 person apartments where everyone gets their own room and there is a bathroom for every pair of two roommates (eg. the 6 person apartments have 3 bathrooms). The dorm style living spaces (which most freshmen live in) do have community bathrooms. I personally think that dorm style living spaces are better for freshmen to meet new people, but you won't be in the honors program and you will have to deal with community bathrooms in those.\n\n2) The honors program classes are optional and the vast majority of the classes we take are not honors program ones. It is cool to have access to that extra resource, but it really doesn't limit us in getting to know more people.\n\n3) You can meet tons of people through events and clubs on campus as well as through housing. There are tons of clubs that are super tight knit and will help you have a vibrant social life. There are hundreds of students in the honors program (roughly 200 a year), and that is where I have met many of my best friends. In my experience, the people I have met through HP have made my college experience far more exciting and you dont need to worry about HP making it bland.\n\n4) The honors program does last for all four years. In the past, students had the option to move elsewhere on campus and stay in the honors program, but now if you want to live on campus and remain in the honors program you have to live in Eighth St. You can still live elsewhere on campus in future years but you would have to leave HP to do so. You can always live off campus in the future and remain in the honors program. As you will find out when you come here, it is really hard to get on campus housing as an upper year. The honors program makes it MUCH easier to get on- campus housing.\n\n5) Other things of note: The honors program isn't perfect. The housing is a HUGE part of the benefit of the program, but you do have to live on West campus. I prefer West to East, but many people who want more parties prefer East. Also, if you are a business or LMC major, most of your classes will be a pretty far walk from West campus. Finally, companies I have worked for have liked seeing the honors program on my resume.",

Make sure you have a u-lock, as cable locks can be cut very easily, and make sure to lock a part of the frame to the the rack- don't lock just your wheel, seatpost, etc. because those can be removed easily and someone can take the rest of the bike (that's why you might see just a wheel locked to a bike rack). And it's a good idea to [register your bike](https://police.gatech.edu/bicycles-campus) with GTPD in case it needs to be removed for some reason (only lock to racks, not trees, railings, etc.) or get stolen, so they can track you down if they find it. Welcome to campus, it's going to be extra great for biking when the construction (new cycle tracks, etc.) is finished!",

As someone with the same hair texture, I usually find that they don\u2019t really handle the intricacies of it too well just bc there is so much to handle with layers &amp; texture.

I would suggest tho what the top comment says if u don\u2019t want to spend too much. I\u2019ve seen some hella good hair done by students and it\u2019s p cheap.\n\nAs for performing your normal routine before, it really depends on who is cutting it. I\u2019ve had ppl ask me to not wash it directly before so they can see it\u2019s natural state, or to wash it before bc they r more comfortable with freshly washed hair (like washes 30 mins b4). The consensus seems to be wash b4 although if u regularly see a specific person, ask them. Communication with the stylist is key",

        "selftext": "I recently got admitted to both the Georgia Tech MHCI (Specialization in Literature, Media, and Communication track) and University of Michigan MSI program. My goal is to land a job in UX Research field and was wondering what are y\u2019all\u2019s opinions about each of the programs?\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve learned that Georgia tech has lots of research lab opportunities, smaller cohort, and prepares people for the industry a lot through networking events, speakers, etc. However, getting Graduate research assistant and/or graduate teaching assistant jobs that helps with funding the masters program is very competitive since there are more students than the funding available. Although they said people can take courses across different tracks (since I\u2019m in LMC, I can fill out a permit to take other courses in Interactive Computing, Industrial Design, Psychology Tracks depending on how popular the courses are). I\u2019m a bit concerned that since I want to pursue the research route, I won\u2019t be able to take courses that I really want in other tracks and end up wasting my time taking courses in LMC that I don\u2019t really want to take. I also was hoping for career fair events that help students land internships, but it seems like there aren\u2019t many opportunities doing that since the events were dedicated towards networking instead of hiring on the spot (which basically feels like I\u2019m going to cold apply and wish for luck). The environment also seems pretty competitive (and it literally looks like I\u2019m working in an office lmao) since I\u2019m surrounded by people going into UX, but ig that\u2019s normal for both schools.\n\nFor the UMSI program, I don\u2019t really know too much about the program since I haven\u2019t been able to talk to many students/attend any virtual events which happens in April. Just by looking through the program, it seems to be pretty broad - covering programming, design, research which I felt like I was doing in my undergrad. And the cohort is larger around 200+ students? \n\nI have a few questions about the program:\n- How competitive is it to get graduate research assistant positions there? Is it easy to just cold email professors for research opportunities and get funding through there? Are the research labs literally school research or more industry based?\n- Are there career fair opportunities just for UX ppl to get internships?  Or is it basically just like LinkedIn where you talk to alumni about resume/portfolio feedback/referrals? \n- for the capstone project in second year, are students expected to develop/code the project apart from having to do the research and design work? Are students supposed to find their own capstone project topics or are they provided by e faculty/staff?\n- how rigorous are the courses, especially the programming ones? Do the courses dive deep into design and research that you can probably apply those skills in industry jobs?\n\nAny thoughts/advice/clarification would be helpful since I\u2019m so conflicted which school to choose. It\u2019s also hard to figure out which schools once I feel like everyone I talked to are so biased in their school.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1brue20)",

I recently received an email from GT offering me the Tech Promise scholarship and was wondering if it\u2019s actually that good. It mentions that it \u201cwill meet 100% of your financial need, assisting with costs associated with housing, food service plan, books, supplies, personal expenses, and, of course, tuition and fees.\u201d However, is this saying it will cover all costs for food, housing, books, etc? Or does it vary based on how much aid a student actually needs? \n\nThe part about \u201c100% of your financial need\u201d is really tripping me up. I was wondering if any of yall have experience or information to share. I couldn\u2019t find much else online that gave a definitive answer. \n\nAlso, I know I shouldn\u2019t worry about this, but is this scholarship actually selective? Or is it given to pretty much any student who meets the income requirements? \n\nThank you all!",

It will cover the balance after your Hope/Zell, any other scholarships you may have received and any other grants like the Pell Grant. It will be obviously confirmed by your FAFSA and they will probably ask for supporting docs like your family tax returns. \n\nIt\u2019s a great scholarship!! Congratulations!\nIt should cover fees, housing, meal plan, books and a small personal expense stipend. Hope should cover your tuition.",

Specific offices, colleges, and programs at GT will seek out FWS students over other applicants, as it keeps the overhead cost of employment low (the government pays a portion of your income), making it a bit easier to get an on-campus position.",

You can also request up to $1,100 for a laptop through tech promise! also, your cap and gown will be paid for when you graduate. Tech promise is extremely prestigious, it only goes to 75 freshman a year, so congratulations!!! Also, if you ever decide to live off campus, tech promise will also provide you money for housing (up to the standard housing allowance that is stated in the COA). \n\nBasically, tech promise will help you get through GT entirely debt free, and you should receive a financial aid refund (mine was about $700/semester this year) to help you cover books and materials. If you have any questions, shoot me a message! Congratulations!!",

Most tech graduates alumni sending their kids here did engineering or computer science not business. Also factor in the high asian population at tech whose families push for them to either pick a path in medicine or engineering and you start to see more markers to explain the wealth gap that aren\u2019t influenced by political ideology. In other words, these are higher paying jobs than average, but not the type of leisure your fellow mba grads are use too. These aren\u2019t your golf during the work day families.

Huge assumption to think 2-3 week vacations are normal (especially if it\u2019s a far away or out of the country vacation). It should be, but it just isn\u2019t. For example, the median family income at GSU is around 60k which is much closer to the median American income of 70k. \n\nI do think the fact that a lot of Tech families don\u2019t understand this is part of the reason why these conversations can get\u2026uncomfortable. You don\u2019t have to be a millionaire to be actively more privileged than the populations that surround you (especially in Atlanta). And, it does occasionally come up in conversations about the atlanta environment. Mainly because they may be used to suburbia. And not even just any surburbia, but very specifically upper middle class ones (I personally come from the south metro rather than the north and get very\u2026surprised the amount of in state kids that actually don\u2019t know where I\u2019m from. I have some theories tho).\n\nEdit: big note that we are talking about the median, which means 50 percent of Tech families actually make *above* that. The median of the school is actually skewed up 25 percentile and 60k.",

My point was thats ops post is really a leading question that shows his bias. He knows the article he wants to write and is just looking for some token students to give it a modicum of authenticity. The student population is largely represented by foreign students on visa, first and second generation immigrants, and instate folks that picked Tech because hope makes it such a good deal financially. The data show immigrant families are either unaware of politics, are politically apathetic, or lean to the left.

I recently received an email suggesting there would be another 5 assignments in the remaining 30 days of the semester (ie weekly assignments). This seems like a complete change to the course expectations, and I was wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this in other classes. In my opinion, weekly assignments shouldn\u2019t even be allowed in grad courses. Most grad students have more important things to do than coursework.\n\nEdit: I feel like there\u2019s no downside to sharing what course this is. It\u2019s AE6012 with PK Yeung.

After that, you\u2019d have to take 3040 and 3043 together, and likely 3025 at the same time, which is a notoriously difficult combination. They\u2019re very heavy on EE fundamentals: electromagnetics, solid state physics and circuit analysis. If you\u2019re not motivated to study these topics, it\u2019s going to be a very brutal semester. If you are, then you\u2019d be able to succeed, but not without a significant amount of effort.\n\nAfter that, you\u2019d just have threads left within the major and you\u2019d be able to study robotics and another thread. The robotics thread is mostly controls which is very math heavy, looking into systems, impulse responses, laplace transforms, etc. \n\nIf your interest is really only in robotics, I\u2019d probably recommend taking CompE, not because it\u2019s easier (I can\u2019t speak towards the difficulty of the major) but because I think it matches your background better and would probably be the path of least resistance to get there. \n\nAs for ME, I can\u2019t comment much on it either but I\u2019d probably say the same as EE; if you don\u2019t have any interest outside of robotics, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. However, their robotics program is different, and I\u2019d recommend looking into it to see if you\u2019re more interested in those topics than the EE/CompE robotics thread.",

(approved by Couchman) It will be on April 5th (a Friday!) at Tech Green (the giant green space in the middle of campus by the student center) from 3-11pm, and will be most importantly FREE and OPEN TO ALL. If you are not familiar with the ATL DIY music scene, this is the perfect chance to get familiar with some of the best prog rock, noise rock, emo, shoegaze, and math rock Atlanta has to offer, alongside some acts hailing from outside the state. Personally, I just wanna let you know that you do NOT want to miss this as this is a once-in-a-lifetime lineup that will go down in the history of 1000 Couches and Couchella lineups!!! That's it, see you there! P.S. Couchman might make an appearance ;) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b38k1sd6owqc1.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6714812bec4b190faf4239beccda312c7e5ccd65",

However, in 2020, tickets were also $45 and we sold out all 500 of them. The event was a hit!\n\nWe got a ton of support from the various Colleges and Departments to help us host the event this year, and trust us that we\u2019re subsidizing it as much as we can. Formal events (and especially alcohol) are just pretty expensive these days, but we\u2019re happy to have been able to not increase the cost since the last time the event was hosted.\n\nEach ticket comes with admission, entertainment, hors d'oeuvres, and two (alcoholic) drink tickets (non alcoholic drinks are unlimited).

I\u2019ve volunteered there once a week for over 3 years now, and I\u2019ve never met a more dedicated group. All the volunteers and workers LOVE those cats and will do anything for them. I\u2019ve genuinely never seen anything questionable go on. The cats all receive excellent medical care, as there are multiple vet techs and 1 full time and 1 part time vet on staff. And if it doesn\u2019t work out or your pet gets really sick and you can\u2019t afford treatment or for any reason whatsoever, they will always take back a cat adopted from them. It\u2019s also a cageless shelter, so you get to really interact with the cat and sit with them before you adopt. 10000/10 I love it there, cannot recommend enough.\n\nEdit: They also have a 96/100 rating on Charity Navigator and post their tax forms every year, so you know the finances are legit too.",

So basically, I wasn't sure about accepting the offer until recently, and I was more focused on looking for jobs in the earlier part of the semester.\n\nHowever, now that I plan on staying for a year longer, I am trying to look for internships this summer, but I know I am a bit late to the game. A lot of offers seem to be gone, and I guess I regret not being decisive about job vs internship earlier in the semester.\n\nIs it really too late to score an internship? For those who are still searching/have gotten offers really recently, what resources have been helping?\n\nThanks!",

I took calc BC in senior year of highschool and got a 4 on the AP exam, giving me credit for both of the classes. I am currently a second semester CS freshman. My uncle and an alumni from here keep saying that I should retake the classes because I will learn so much more than I ever could in the AP class. I do not care if calc 1 and calc 2 are harder here, I will find some way, probably (lmao), and I do not mind being \"behind\", as well as the money but what do y'all think? Are they worth retaking at GT? Or should I go ahead and go forward in multivariable calculus? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much :)",

Multi-variable calc is really simple in the beginning and you can refresh your calc knowledge during the first half of the semester. Shit gets quite tough and weird at the end of the course, but if you did well enough in the beginning, you will have a buffer. Even if you have to squeeze by with a C, it is much better than retaking.",

        "selftext": "\\[Throwaway\\]\n\nI have some questions regarding RSO ethics and morals. I'm interested in gauging public opinion on distinguishing between behaviors labeled as \"college kids being college kids\" and those deemed inappropriate for a Registered Student Organization (RSO). I'm trying to ascertain whether my concerns are overly stringent or if there are genuine issues at hand.\n\n1. Regarding alcohol events without proper authorization and the presence of minors: While it's not uncommon for minors to consume alcohol in college settings, if RSOs hold unofficial events not listed on their official platforms (such as their Engage page), and fail to adhere to institutional protocols regarding alcohol events\u2014such as obtaining required waivers or appointing sober monitors as outlined in GT policy\u2014does this fall under the umbrella of typical collegiate behavior or is it inappropriate for an RSO? What about traditions at these events that involve getting minors to drink?\n\n2. What are your thoughts on RSOs using their funds for such events? This includes collecting entry fees or utilizing dues/fees paid by students for exclusive board/executive member gatherings. Note that in that last situation, the students who paid the dues/fees are not eligible to come to the events, only the board/executive members of the RSO are allowed. Additionally, what's your stance on RSOs potentially accessing funds from various sources such as SGA, RHA, or Parents funds for these events? While the funds might not directly finance alcohol purchases but instead cover expenses like venue bookings, is this practice acceptable?\n\n3. Concerning the use of SGA funds for purposes not explicitly indicated on invoices/bills: Given the challenges in obtaining funding from SGA, do you believe that if strategies such as submitting a bill for something and then utilizing the funds to do something else prove successful, they should be employed? I know SOFO reimburses clubs but I'm coming from the angle where RSOs might get invoices for one item from a vendor, and show that to SOFO, but then not use that money reimbursed for that, either through a deal made with the vendor or through refunds/returns offered by the vendor. This entails generating invoices that may not accurately reflect the RSO's expenditures.\n\nI'm seeking clarity on these matters to determine whether my concerns align with broader perspectives or if they are indicative of a more stringent viewpoint.\n\nIf this sounds reminiscent of ChatGPT, it's because I utilized it to refine the questions for clarity. English is not my primary language, and I wanted to ensure the questions were articulated as effectively as possible.",

Tldr, one bad apple can spoil the barrel :(\n\nFor the RSOs that are doing this, this is 200% NOT ok to abuse the system like this and ruin it for the rest of us RSOs who are working hard and doing our absolute best to comply with rules and regulations (there are so many already, it is what it is). Again, RSOs that are partaking in this this behavior *will* ruin it for the rest of us, and it's already as hard as it is getting money (re: SGA running out of money TWICE without any prior warning) trying to fund events for members possibly due to reasons like you mentioned, which makes me really sad and frustrated. Smaller clubs like my own are really feeling the weight/hit of these funding lapses in trying to keep member engagement up. \n\nI don't feel more can be done about the receipt issue without heavily impacting especially smaller and younger RSOs for the worse - I'd actually strongly advise against any further rules imposed on the rebursement process (we already submit a cleared bank statement and invoice) due to the funds OFTEN coming out of officers' *personal checking accounts* and then taking easily a month for reimbursement with the current process in place due to SOFO being perpetually broken for lack of better term. To put into perspective: when you're paying for *$3000 worth of food out of your own banking account* because you cannot in good faith trust SOFO to clear your GTF (if your RSO has one) or custodial account in time for payment, the last thing you want is for more delay on getting that money back from Parents Fund/SGA/Buzzfunds. \n\nI really do believe the majority of RSOs are here because they want to make a positive impact on the student culture and general community at large (my RSO is a small philanthropic one, and I know my board works and arm and a leg BTS to make it an org with a mission we stand behind), but unfortunately such issues will persist. I do want to take a \"holier than thou\" stance with my RSO but rather use it as an example of what most RSOs are doing - working hard and trying their best to comply with things. \n\nI think one way to combat this issie without massively impacting things for all other RSOs is ito make it so a student can file a concern/complaint to SGA about a certain RSO's misuse of funds for alcohol, SGA can conduct an investigation, and then use leverage of it coming back on the exec team + get the RSO advisor involved (also really sucky of the RSO to not consider how this could affect their sponsoring GT faculty :/).\n\nSo there's my unfiltered 3 cents heh :')",

        "selftext": "Hey! I am submitting this as an update to a post I made on this account a few months ago\n\nLink: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/17b26d9/maybe\\_i\\_do\\_not\\_belong\\_at\\_georgia\\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/17b26d9/maybe_i_do_not_belong_at_georgia_tech/)\n\nYou can (probably should) read that post for context. TLDR for this one: I am still not really doing well. I am unsure if this school is a good fit atp. I especially would appreciate advice from those who have taken alternative routes to get here (or even left if you're in this subreddit!). Also, students that aren't so intensely stemy.\n\nI have tried a lot of the advice given underneath the post. I didn't give up and I have been doing well on paper. But, I feel like I am in a dark place mentally.\n\nI have meet more people, but this school makes everyone so busy and I am just not high on people's priority list. I wish I at least had a consistent study group. I finally started psychotherapy and medication for my ADHD which has helped, but it does hurt when they recommend \"body doubling\" and I have no one to do that with. It feels like I am lost in a sea of people. It doesn't help that their productivity doesn't motivate me anymore. It just makes me feel like I am wasting all this time being sad when I am suppose to be actually working. Self fulfilling cycle.\n\nI'm not sure if I like my major anymore. I dread taking upper division courses soon. I feel stuck because this school is such a stem bubble, so I feel like if I choose another option I am going to be fucked. Probably not realistic, but I have no idea what to do. The only classes I really enjoy taking are LMC courses and some maths. That could be a solution instead of just transferring, but I am completely unsure of what to do. I feel like honestly I should've went to a school with a bigger arts department, instead of such a STEM heavy school. I have a lot of different hobbies that I would to realistically pursue, but the bubble makes trying too feel futile. I feel like being here has changed me in a bad way.\n\nI have tried so many different ways to be happier here, but it seems most of my complaints come back to this school's environment. I've have done so much personal work to try to become \"better\". I think atp I have used up most of my avenues. I might be clouded in my judgement, but something about being here is very depressing about being here. Part of it is probably that it feels like others don't share my feelings, which I know is not true, but it's hard to gauge that when it seems no one really wants to gain or deepen their friendships with me. I have joined support groups which make me feel a bit better, but idk.\n\nI don't feel this way when I am at home, even tho I don't even *like* being at home. Coming back here after spring break made me very emotionally upset, and I have tests coming up that I need to score high on. And homework due right after break. etc etc. So now I feel like my rest isn't even due. I kinda dread being here. I don't want to feel that way. I don't even really have anything to look forward in the summer except sleep since I haven't gotten an internship or well *anything.*\n\nWhat I do know is that I feel significantly better around people from other schools in the area. Which, in theory, should be easy to find a tech equivalent, but it's not happening. It makes me feel trapped since obviously I spend most of my time here, so this should be the environment I at least mildly enjoy.  I know some of the judgement is in my head, but they feel a lot less judgy and have things they do that aren't pure academic pressure points. They are hobby groups here, but having conversations just leads straight back to how \"oh I didn't sleep because I studied all night\" or \"Oh I'm have like 3 tests this week\" like omg. I just want somewhere that's a complete destressor place. The times I have found those, people don't come long term! I'm in groups on campus that have dwindled down to 3-4 people. (Feel free to recommend orgs below, there's so many here so this might just be a spotlight issue).\n\nThey also seem to just judge me less...socially? Like no offense to anyone here (please I get it I am also nerdy and introverted), but a lot of y'all are socially awkward to a fault. I have the most luck making very temporary connections at parties, otherwise I am not sure what I am doing that's wrong. I have had long talks about it with my therapist, and she has some theories about me (I'll only expand if asked lol). This makes me hesitant to give up entirely, however,  I even see this problem in a lot of group activities I do (not even trying to make friends I just want to work on projects efficiently). I am definitely a similar breed, but that feels so weird! Why am I one of the *more social* people on campus but the least social at home??\n\nThere have been events this semester I have enjoyed, but they are dampened due to how much WORK I have despite not taking that many credit hours (I have a grivance which a certain class but I don't want to say too much). So, either I go to the event and feel like I could've used that time doing work, or I do the work and feel stressed. This is something I have personally improved, however, this late into the semester makes me feel like I'm playing catch up. I am seen as quite bubbly and personable to many, so no ones really check in on me. I feel not only isolated but a bit masked as well to people.\n\nIt even got to the point I decided to attempt to look at some actual social clubs. For some, that would mean greek life. Being black (and a women since people did not clock that on my last post. Might be part of the reason why I feel the way I feel about these orgs) I tried to attend some Divine 9 (google if needed) related events. However, I do have some reservations about them, which is a whole other conversation. In short, I realized even if I joined one, my problems wouldn't be solved really.\n\nThe institution is also irritating me (again). I feel like I'm jumping through hoops to fix problems that aren't even my fault. It can take days for them to reply to me, and I even once got an email reply after I got no confirmation on something basically saying \"students aren't told every step of the process\". I just wanted to know if they received my documentation or not :(.\n\nThere might be something that I should do that I am missing. I already contacted a friend to talk about it since I know people (even you people of reddit), would prefer to hear my problems than hear that I had a mental health episode. But yeah, it's heavy times for me.",

The STEM thing is all a big joke at the end of the day, people put way too much weight on the idea and that influences how they view GT as a whole. LMC, Business, Design etc are all great majors here with awesome professors.\n\nAlso, you are welcome to transfer colleges, but I'd be surprised if much changed socially. There are obviously some awkward people at Tech, but by and large it's the same people you'd find anywhere, just maybe a little more GPA focused. Stereotypes can influence how we view our environment and you might be stuck viewing Tech through a stereotypical lense. There are friendly people everywhere here, they might just be doing their own thing. I'm telling you this because I'd hate for you to put in all the effort to transfer schools only to realize the grass isn't greener.",

I don't know much about transferring majors, but I'm sorry things have been really rough for you. \n\nI empathize with the imbalances of communicating with others. That issue of you being the only one to reach out, or the only one to coordinate plans, was something I had to navigate the beginning of this fall. \n\nMy solution was to find activities that I was comfortable doing with others (if they happened to join) but that I can do on my own. Furthermore, I try to seek out people to talk to one on one (since groups are more difficult to work with sometimes), and after that, I opt for studying hard and doing research I care about. As my schedule continues to get busier, I have less time to worry about other people, allowing me to more naturally stop communications with someone if they haven't consistently reciprocated. \n\nIt's important to remember that the lack of communication isn't your fault, but that means you've got to also identify what makes you content, happy, or gives you meaning separately from others. I wish you the best of luck with everything, and please be kind to yourself!",

And not having a social scene you feel connected to can make it even harder. I appreciate all you\u2019ve done to try so hard and to try and change your circumstances. \n\nI will say that the best decision I made (and it sounds counter intuitive) was to take summer classes after my freshman year. I met some of my best friends that summer because it\u2019s a much more relaxed environment, professors are generally more chill, and the things going on around campus were more fun to me. \n\nAlso you say you aren\u2019t looking forward to upper level classes, but I found those to be easier and more helpful in making friends as well because they were smaller and required group work, and often had the same people in them. I settled into my niche part of campus that way rather than being in giant lecture halls all the time. \n\nI wish you all the best, no matter what you decide. Tech isn\u2019t easy and you\u2019re already this far, but you also shouldn\u2019t sacrifice your own mental health. Good luck.",

But that doesn\u2019t really work.

Going to a club or joining a frat isn\u2019t going to actually create the closeness you\u2019re probably seeking unless you actually make an effort to build relationships with the people there. Otherwise you will have no more socialization than the obligatory \u201cgroup events\u201d that everyone in the club is invited to and even those may not be super fun if you don\u2019t really talk to anyone there. They can be a good jumping off point, but you should focus more on individual friendships. Don\u2019t be trying to get in with that big, loud group - they all already have lots of friends. In stead, go somewhere *consistently* - it doesn\u2019t really matter where, club, gym, study sport, can all work - and try to have a conversation with someone there. Again, not someone who is part of a big group, just someone who is alone or with one other person say and who is there regularly.

They're all going to the same city, so they decide to split a rental car instead of sleeping in the airport and waiting until the next day.\n\nAfter a 6 hour drive, all 3 are tired, it's almost midnight, they have several more hours to go, and the rain keeps getting worse. In need of rest, and with a long way to go to the next town, they finally decide to stop at a random farmhouse and ask if they can spend the night there.\n\nThe farmer is happy to welcome them, but only has room for 2 people, and the third will have to sleep in the barn where he keeps his animals. They reluctantly agree, with one of the two Tech fans in the barn and the other two guys inside.\n\nAfter half an hour, someone knocks on the farmer's front door - it's the man from the barn, who says he's a Hindu, and he can't share a room with a cow as they are sacred in his religion. He switches spots with one of the guys staying inside.\n\nAnother half hour later, he also bangs on the door - he's a devout Jew and doesn't want to be near a pig since they're \"unclean animals\". The farmer is getting annoyed and tells the 3rd guy to switch places. Now the two Tech fans are together in the house with the UGA fan in the barn.\n\nLater there's yet another knock on the door, it's the pig.",

The person I spoke with made it seem you won\u2019t be able to choose your roommates, room, building, floor, anything. I was specifically told they\u2019d assign us as they see fit to make fall move in easier. They said that the two places we signed on the housing contract about self assign basically aren\u2019t applicable. \n\nI\u2019m posting here because when I asked where this info was released I was told they did not post anywhere, and I find it very disingenuous to make a major change like this without notifying anyone. I\u2019m just sorry I didn\u2019t know about this when I filled out the housing form.\n\nIf I have any incorrect information I\u2019m happy to edit the post, just going off housing help desk correspondance.\n\nEdit: for context I\u2019m a junior BS student, no clue what\u2019s going on with ignite or for grad students",

Currently targeting April 9th-11th, but the final / official dates will be emailed soon.\n\nEdit: To clarify, incoming first-year dates and process will look a little different. You'll get program specific  information soon.\n\nApologies for the delay - long day. There are a few reasons why there might be some confusion:\n\n* If your fall assignment is in one of the buildings that will be open this summer, we will pre-assign you to your future fall space, so you will not have to move at the end of the summer\n* Similarly, if your current spring assignment is in a building that will be open for the summer, we will pre-assign you to your current room\n* These steps will be taken in that order and before the self-assign period begins (so someone else can't take your room). You can technically change it during self-assign, but... please don't\n* For all other returning students, self-assign is tentatively scheduled for April 9th - 11th, but we will email out more info and confirmed dates soon\n* **If you are a grad living over at Tenth and Home this summer**... you will not have a self-assign period. There are major projects happening in that area, and multiple buildings will be offline. Our team will assign the very few spaces that are available in the most efficient way possible. These students have been heavily communicated with over the last few months though -  I think the initial communication about the project and it's upcoming impact went out like a year and a half ago. Family residents should have received an email today about their assignment, and individual grads should receive their assignment email tomorrow.\n\nI'll speak with our team tomorrow to make sure we're communicating correct information.\n\nHope that helps - let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nCC: u/International_Air561, u/Classily_Classless",

(Assuming you are referring to OMED's Challenge Program)\n\nThey will definitely let you leave if you have an emergency, but you won't really get days off, only hours. If you have to leave, you'd need to contact your assigned counselor and let them know what's up.\n\nChallenge is a very intense program that simulates a 12 credit hour late summer short semester, meaning 4 classes over the course of a month. On weekends, there will be lots of activities you will be required to attend, from volunteer work to career development to company field trips. In fact, we usually did a full career day with several company executives visiting. I don't know if it's still done, but we also did white water rafting and a talent show every year. I think the students also got one weekend off to study for finals, but that's about it.\n\nWith all of that plus classes to keep up with, your schedule will likely be so full you wouldn't have time to go home.\n\nI'd recommend contacting OMED and see if they can give you the full schedule of activities so you can plan.\n\nHope this helps!",

I'll double-check tomorrow just to be sure though.\n\nYour friend may be referring to the prox chip on the BuzzCard. Currently, most BuzzCards have two chips - a prox chip and a DESFire chip. The prox chip can be cloned pretty easily (I've done it before). So can the magstrip on the card. And when BuzzCards used to have a barcode printed on them, well... those were pretty easy to clone too.\n\nHowever, to my knowledge... the MIFARE DESFire EV2/3 chips have not been compromised, hacked, or cloned to date. Some of the older chip technologies designed in like 2002 have been hacked, but not the latest ones. The new door access system uses these DESFire chips.\n\nI had other security improvements in mind when I mentioned it, but this is a good one too.",

I know people here wouldn't like that either because Tech had something similar for Covid reasons in Fall 2020 and I got *downvoted to hell* when I pushed back against the complaints. \n\nIt's almost as though people are never happy with anything...",

        "selftext": " \n\nTo preface, I'm sorry if my grammar and syntax + repeating stuff is kind of bad here. I'm kind of crying right now haha. Also, I'm not certain if this is allowed to be posted, so I do apologize mods.\n\nSince the beginning of fall semester, It's been extremely tough for me.\n\nI had a bad breakup of two years where I invested everything into it. I dropped everyone for her, and suffocated her due to it. I wanted to spend 24/7 with her, and once she left, I had noone and nothing to be happy about anymore. She's since found someone new, which also now crushes my heart even further, that someone can move on just like that. My view of love is that I'm willing to work through anything with someone and dedicate everything to them, but parts of that view is just so twisted, as much of it is rooted in insecurities and selfishness. I never changed during the relationship, and only is changing somewhat now.\n\nI also feel so behind compared to my peers, and feel like I haven't made any meaningful relationships since I've been admitted. I've tried clubs, talking to people in my classes, and continuously pursued contact with the people I've already met, but I still feel like I'm just slowly suffocating myself to death. I've tried care, but It kind of was a repeat of everything I've tried, being the typical do new things meet new people, but I just don't feel like I connect with anyone. Everything above has been a detriment to my mental health, and my overall motivation, and I feel like I'm just spiraling out of controlling right now.\n\nI really feel so alone right now... I really don't know what else to do at the moment. This spring break has been just reminiscing about the time I spent with her, but she loves someone else now. It's been around half a year now, and I just feel like I'm slowly killing myself.\n\nOn the topic of meeting someone new, I've had a few girls ask for my number, but my heart just doesn't sit right with it. It feels like I don't click with any specific one of them either. This isn't the love that I imagined as a child... My heart hurts so much :)\n\nI know I haven't matured yet, but if this is maturing, I don't want it. I want a childish kind of love, but It feels so hard to love anyone else at the moment... I know my mistakes, but I can't change them anymore. I need to move forward, but It's been so difficult.\n\nIs anyone down to talk or give me some tips? I'm really sorry if this doesn't belong here haha.",

                "body": "While I do truly empathize with you over that break up - you need to move on. You need to realize that you are a person of worth apart from her. It seems your identity was her and now you need to find who you are.\n\nEveryone feels behind all the time - I promise you are not alone there. Instead of comparing yourself to others, evaluate how you feel about your progress. What are your goals at Tech (I hope to get an education)? Write down your goals and hang them somewhere. Remind yourself of those goals and that those are what you work towards, not being like someone else or \"catching up to peers\". Honestly, when guys give me trouble is when I work the hardest on my grades/other goals.\n\nSoon all this will pass and you will find someone else. In the meantime, find contentment in singleness (and don't feel pressure to get in a relationship either, I joke that there is no reason to settle until you are at least 30 :)).\n\nIf you are religious at all I'll leave you with this: God has a plan for your life. All you need to do now is sit back and let him take control. Don't worry about tomorrow because he's got it all.\n\nPraying for you.",

I'm also scared that I may not reach that goal, even if I meet someone new, as I'm a second year CS major, and I don't think I'm ready to even try to apply for internships.\n\nI've had friends tell me that I should find a rebound. That I should go to clubs, go to parties, go to bars. I just don't know why, but I don't want to do any of that. it doesn't sit with me morally, and I'd prefer if the one I love doesn't do so either. It's an immature look at things, I know.\n\nI also wished I was religious. She was too and I regrettably mocked her for it because of how immature I was. Because of my athiesm, I am a nihilist, and just want to make the person I'm with happy in the end. \n\nOverall, I think my mindset needs a complete change. I'm just a bit sad right now still. I'm not sure where to start. Could you give me some things that I should work towards right now?",

Work to build a future for yourself and the people you care about now (maybe parents or siblings). If this doesn't work, maybe money isn't your goal. Do you want to help people? Maybe you want to make a product to help people of a certain demographic?\n\nHere were some of the goals I made for myself before I even got on campus - granted some of them are kind of silly given I was young, but still:\n\n1. Make someone smile everyday\n2. Trust God in everything\n3. Do my best in my classes\n4. Stand up for my beliefs\n5. Participate in research\n\nI actually still have those as well as some new ones I have added saved to my desktop so I see them everyday.\n\nAs for your other things:\n\nDon't feel pressured to go to bars or clubs or anything like that. Anytime anyone tells me to do that I just say \"No thanks, I'm not into that stuff\". That is not an immature point of view at all. I much prefer having real, meaningful conversations over loud music and drunkenness.\n\nI know you say you aren't religious, but surprisingly many of your morals seem to align with religion.\n\nYou can completely ignore this next part, but I just wanted to put it out there in case you have been feeling this way: Sometimes we just need to hit the bottom before we can realize the truth. Even though you have gone through rough times, God is waiting for you with open arms. No matter what you have done or how lost you may think you are, he forgives and he loves you. Unlike humans who come and go, God will never leave you. I have also gone through some rough patches where I have felt completely alone, and those are the times I grew closest to my religion. If you want to discuss religion at all let me know. You seem to be questioning, that's why I bring it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd for your internships, you're a second-year - go for it! Don't be afraid of rejection.",

I want to make enough money, and work from home, so that we can spend more time together! I get lonely really easily, kind of like a bunny! I think overall, I'm a very selfish person. I do want the one I love to be happy, but I also want to be with them all the time. I need to work past that before anything else, but it's so hard since she's gone now. \n\nI really never had high aspirations. I never wanted to be CEO, I never wanted to help lots of people, I'm really just a selfish person. I just want to be with the one I love. \n\nI'm scared I'll never meet anyone with the same morals as I do. I do realize that my attachment style is very unhealthy, so I'll work past that for now. I know I have to.\n\nI started fencing alongside other hobbies, but stopped because I felt so depressed. I realized I started them to impress her, but should really start attending again haha.\n\nI really did wish God was real, but I'll be honest, I'll never believe. I'm too rooted in reality. I really did wish there was a heaven. We had a plush daughter named Bunbun. She has since then told me that Bunbun is just a plush, and that Bunbun matters nothing to her anymore, but I can't take her back because it'll just remind me of her. I hope she went to plushie heaven... I don't want her to suffer on this earth anymore.\n\nI'm so weird. I've tried all of the methods to move on. It's really not helping right now. I still cry every other day. I feel so dejected. I'm still such a baby.\n\nI ultimately don't have any personal goals to work towards that I want. It really sucks. I was too codependent, and now I'm suffering due to it.",

As long as you are doing that, you should be very proud of yourself.\n\nMake personal goals. Sit down right now and set a timer for five minutes. Think about your life and the world and what you can do to help it. Don't think about a girlfriend.\n\nWhen you get back to school, I want you to volunteer for something. Here is a link to do just that: [https://unitedwayatlanta.org/upcoming-volunteer-projects/](https://unitedwayatlanta.org/upcoming-volunteer-projects/) Be a book buddy for an elementary school kid maybe. \n\nYou can make a difference in this world and you can have goals.

                "body": "I want to start off my saying your feelings are completely valid to have. That\u2019s not just \u201ctherapist talk\u201d, that\u2019s the truth. You invested a large chunk of yourself into this relationship and now that it\u2019s gone, it has you feeling lonely, dejected, and betrayed. Those are all normal feelings to have after a breakup. How do I know this? Because I went through the exact same thing you\u2019re going through. Literally, it is almost exactly the same. I had a relationship of two years, invested everything I had and more, thought I was going to marry this girl. Then sophomore fall comes along and she breaks up with me to start dating someone else. Reading your post is almost verbatim exactly what I experienced. \n\nThat said, I\u2019ll comment here, but if you want to talk in more detail, my dms are always open.\n\nI want to try to address each of your points in the order you wrote them, and then give my opinion and how I got through it. It\u2019s going to sound harsh, especially right now, but you need to hear it. I always want to emphasis that you won\u2019t get better right away. It\u2019ll take time. Even more time than you have already given it.\n\n\n\u201cI invested everything into it. I dropped everyone for her. I wanted to spend 24/7 with her\u2026\u201d \n\nit sounds like you already know this, but I want you to recognize that this is not how relationships should work. I\u2019m sure you let her keep her friendships, but then, whenever you tried to hang out with your friends, she complained about not spending time with her, so you slowly started to ignore your friends. That\u2019s not how relationships work. You should be allowed time for your personal friends (and relationships) and she should be allowed time for her friends (and relationships). Note: relationships does not mean romantic. Hopefully, this breakup will show you that this is an unhealthy/toxic relationship trait. Although, it might take a few more months to recognize this.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s since found someone new\u2026she can just move on like that.\u201d \n\nIf there\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned, is that girls don\u2019t just \u201cmove on.\u201d She most likely had ended the relationship mentally weeks before. Note: this is just my personal experience, yours may vary. But, I could tell something was up weeks before I got broken up with. I just didn\u2019t imagine it would lead to us breaking up. So, take a hard look at the last few weeks of the relationship and see if she seemed more distant, or if arguments suddenly stopped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to work through anything\u2026and dedicate everything to them.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re religious, but something that helped me, after talking to my priest, is the idea that God should be your number one relationship. That your relationships should point to God and not dominate God. What this means, is that you should feel the way you described towards God, and then lesser towards your mortal relationships. If you\u2019re not religious, take it like this: relationships shouldn\u2019t take precedence over your own well-being. They should only enhance it. (Obviously there will be times when they do not, but that does not necessarily mean they are bad relationships.)\n\n\u201cI feel so behind.\u201d\n\nI got C\u2019s and honestly didn\u2019t even care about school for the entire fall semester after the breakup. It\u2019s normal to lose all interest in school. Maybe consider taking a semester long break to rediscover yourself. But I honestly, would advise against it.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t made any meaningful connections\u201d\n\nConnections are hard to make. It\u2019s relatively easy to talk with people. More difficult to deepen those connections. All I can say to this is keep trying. Some of my best friends were people I had only passing contact with for an entire semester until the last week, then we got super close super fast, and completely unexpectedly. Honestly, and I am being 100% honest, download hinge, bumble, (maybe not tinder), and go on dates, or even just text people. Don\u2019t look for anything (not hookups, not relationships), just go and talk with people. Use it as a way to get to know people and ask people more personal questions, even if they don\u2019t lead to anything. Use it as a place to try and develop deeper connections, because that\u2019s kinda the point of them. Listen to the podcast \u201cPeople I mostly admire\u201d no. 126. It\u2019s about having deep conversations. \n\n\u201cThink about Time spent with her\u201d\n\nMost importantly, stop doing that. She is out of your life now. She is not coming back. Don\u2019t try to Gatsby your way out of this. It\u2019s not going to happen. That was the hardest part for me. There\u2019s this sort of glory or honor that you can trap yourself into, thinking it\u2019s honorable to wait for her. Don\u2019t do that. There\u2019s nothing honorable about making yourself feel terrible. \n\n\u201cHad a few girls ask for my number\u201d\n\nThe good news is\u2026you\u2019re still attractive! And I\u2019m going to be honest, after the breakup, I didn\u2019t really start to deeply connect with girls until about 2 years later. I had hookups and flings that I was attracted to and cared for, but none of them that I \u201cloved\u201d. And I got called out on it by one of them. It took me a long time to feel comfortable, to feel safe to open up again and give myself the opportunity to be hurt again. My guess is the reason you don\u2019t \u201cclick\u201d with them is because you\u2019re either 1) comparing them to her. 2) are afraid to be vulernable because the last time you were, you got betrayed. Or 3) both. It takes time to heal, so don\u2019t expect to get right back into another deep relationship immediately. Find a way to let yourself be loved, and to love others. It\u2019s easier if you make yourself vulnerable to your friends first. Also, Ted Lasso has unironically good examples of mantras and mental health for men.\n\n\u201cI want a childish kind of love\u201d\n\nThe good news is, childish love still exists. But you have to choose to have it, and that requires being vulnerable. What is a childish love? It\u2019s a love that loves 100% without fear for the consequences. If you are afraid of the consequences, you will never have a childish love. It\u2019s easier when it\u2019s (I\u2019m assuming) your first relationship. Harder once you\u2019ve been hurt. But you have to give yourself time to heal, otherwise it won\u2019t get better. It took me 2 years to heal. But each day was a little bit easier.\n\nOkay, I think that answered your things. Now to talk about my experience.\n\nIt hurt. It really really hurt. For a long time. More than I\u2019m willing to admit. I wasn\u2019t necessarily suicidal, but I wasn\u2019t really enjoying life. I had a panic attack after seeing her driving with her new man. The panic attack was terrifying (but I did go and hit a bench press PR afterwards that took another year to hit). The point is, healing takes time. I wasn\u2019t back to 100% until 2 years later. But, I was back to 50% by about the 6 month mark. And 80% after about a year. I think you might be in a similar boat. There\u2019s good days and there\u2019s bad days. And I think it will probably take the same length of the relationship before you\u2019re finally fully over it.\n\nThings that helped me. Going to the gym (cliche). Im still there every morning at 6am. It doesn\u2019t have to be weightlifting, but gaining some muscle is always beneficial for confidence. It also doesn\u2019t have to be the gym (although I strongly recommend getting in shape), it could be art, poetry, writing, paintball. Do something with your newfound time. Learn something. Friends are helpful. I know you\u2019re struggling to find them, but lean on anyone you have. Parents, family, siblings, etc. Stop following them on social media. Seriously. Nothing beneficial will come from seeing their life without you in it. They didn\u2019t want you in it, so don\u2019t try to keep up with them. There\u2019s no reason to. \n\nGoing back to Ted Lasso, don\u2019t watch \u201csigma male movies\u201d like blade runner with Ryan gosling or American psycho. Those just mess with your mental state.\n\nI want you to know, it does get easier, and eventually you will get over her. I\u2019m living proof. I\u2019m now finally getting into another fulfilling relationship, and it feels amazing. But, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without finally allowing myself to open up and be vulnerable.\n\nMy dms are always open if you want to talk or hear more about my experience. Feel free to interrogate me!\n\nAlso, watch [this](https://youtu.be/ZQht2yOX9Js?si=dsdAMenN0RRJM64k).",

You need to move on before trying to be with someone new. Instead of trying to heal your wound with others, you need to heal yourself first.\n\nEveryone will say these things, but instead of trying to socialize with people you don't enjoy being with, you can set hobbies and goals for yourself. You should do things that will keep your mind busy, or you can prevent yourself from thinking too much by exercising and tiring yourself out. Whenever I don't occupy myself with something, I always think about depressive and negative things. But whenever I keep myself busy, these thoughts never come to me. I'm not saying you should keep yourself so busy that you die of exhaustion, but you should find something to devote yourself to. \n\nFrom what I see, you're attempting to commit yourself to a person, and that might not be the best course of action. I believe that by prioritizing your own happiness first, you'll eventually encounter someone whom you'll love again. Instead of seeking someone to make you happy, focus on creating your own happiness first. Then, aim to find someone who will complement and share in your happiness.\n\nBy the way, I think that childish love is something you can experience no matter how old you are. Also I'm slightly older than most of the current college students and doing undergrad here and I cannot connect anyone in my classes. I enjoy talking to them but it is never a deep level connection.

Do you not get brought down by the barrier that everyone feels like they have up.\n\nI wish I could help you find happiness, but honestly, I'm struggling myself. Lots of people my age have finished school and some are even starting families. Coming from another country, where relationships mean a lot, it's tough here where everything feels kind of shallow. Maybe it's just part of growing up, or maybe it's because English isn't my first language, but it feels like this language makes everything less real. It's been getting me down, and I've been keeping to myself more. I'd rather have a few real friends than lots of superficial ones. Most of my interactions now just feel like small talk.\n\nBut even with all this, I find moments of happiness when I can accept how things are right now. Sure, there are days when I can't quite do that, but I'm learning to just wait for those feelings to pass. But honestly I always feel like I'm always waiting for something to be happy. For example I think I will be happier when I graduate, I think I will do this and do that when I graduate. Or I think when I have a meaningful relationship I assume I will be happier. But this is all wrong. I think happiness is just in the small things but we still spend all of our live waiting for to be happy. \n\nMaybe you should just give some time to yourself to feel these feelings little bit. It is okay to feel lost. There hasn't been a time in the last 4 years that I haven't felt lost. \n\nI'm wondering, what were the things that made you happy before you got into a relationship with her?",

I can't change what I haven't started. I'm behind lot of students here, but I've made it my goal to start somewhere and achieve small goals and slowly change/modify them to achieve larger goals.\n\nThe same applies to making friends. I struggle with friendships too, but I'm forcing myself to get into various things. I make time to attend various events and just try to enjoy them either myself or with the people there, without expecting to form any friendships because quite honesty I might not see these people again. Biggest thing I'd say is get into things your interested in and can do by yourself, and do them consistently. This way you can connect with other people over shared interests and start forming friendships.\n\nI'm not a therapist, but if you need a friend, I'm always down to meet on campus and have lunch, no pressure!

Let yourself feel everything, the misery, the joy, and heartache. It\u2019ll feel so overwhelming, but eventually, and this might take forever, you\u2019ll come out the other side. Just remember to be kind to yourself and take it at your own pace, you have to remember you have so much life ahead of you, and it\u2019s okay to take your own time. I\u2019d also recommend going fully no contact with your ex as well, it\u2019s not that you stopped loving her, but it\u2019s for your healing considering how codependent y\u2019all were for each other. \n\nWhile you do all that, just make sure you do things FOR yourself, no one else. Maybe it\u2019s join an IM sport, go work out, read more books, watch more movies, etc. Ideally something that gets you actively engaged and piquing your own interests.\n\nYou\u2019ll make your way out of this maze eventually, the problem is that for a lot of people, they think that \u201ceventually\u201d means months or weeks when it could be years. You got out of a LONG relationship, that shit will stick in your heart forever. Just keep the faith and love and forgive yourself and you\u2019ll make it.\n\nYou can also DM me if you\u2019re comfortable with that. We could chat or get coffee if you\u2019d like.",

It\u2019s normal to feel down or even enter a temporary acute depression for a bit after a breakup, particularly when\u00a0it defines a large portion of who you are. Humans aren\u2019t meant to have that much of their personal identity ripped away from them, especially when they\u2019ve only just started figuring out who they are. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you.\n\nYou can (and will) 100% bounce back. It\u2019s really really really hard to imagine that things will be okay. But they kinda just\u2026 will eventually. You\u2019ll meet closer friends (even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it now), find more things you enjoy, and start doing things that give you purpose. Your brain will slowly make sense of what\u2019s happening, re-anchor itself, and heal. And slowly, but surely, you\u2019ll start feeling happy and you\u2019ll get back to normal. It might take many months, but it\u2019s a process. Humans are beautifully resilient creatures.\n\nBut, a part of that process above is taking the time to think about what happened rationally (or at least not shut down your feelings). You might not feel rational now, and that\u2019s okay. You might try a thousand different frameworks of thought, and that\u2019s okay. But eventually, you\u2019ll need to be honest with yourself and process everything. It\u2019s easier to forget than it looks.\n\nYou\u2019ll be good, although it might take awhile to start to see that. No matter what happens, everything will be okay. If you want to talk, dm me (although I only use reddit when I\u2019ve got a specific question, so I might take a bit to respond lol).\u00a0",

Congratulations, you're already at the top of the first mountain - you recognize that you have a flawed view of relationships. A lot of people never recognize this, and you should be encouraged by this all because this is a profound growth opportunity for you.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a good therapist, and stick with it. Work through this stuff. It may not feel like it's helping at times, but you're young and have time for things to click. You just need to put in the self-work and ultimately a lot of these issues will probably be okay.\n\nSide-note: As an adult (31 as of this past week), one of the biggest things I recognize in peers my age, and even in myself, is that a lot of people still struggle setting boundaries for themselves and for others around them. Boundaries, and communicating them properly and clearly, are really important - they are what we use as safeguards to our peace and serenity in life. It's important to be very conscious of how you set and maintain them, and you need to be paying attention to how often you shift the goalposts on these boundaries (super common mistake the make out of guilt).\n\nYou'll come to find that if you work on boundaries and communication that it will ultimately put you far ahead of the curve emotionally, but also in your career. Good luck. You're going to figure it out! :)",

If I allow myself to think about it too much I start bawling, and I don't cry normally. I pray we both find the connections we yearn for and need.\n\nVolunteering can help. So can just making someone else smile. Turning your focus on the problems and needs of others can sometimes put yours in perspective, I suppose, though I personally believe we all have battles to fight (though some may not seem like battles to others). Helping someone else can bring a purpose and joy more longstanding than any temporary, fleeting smile.\n\nEdit: I've read a few of your replies. You seem to really be struggling, and an adamant atheist to boot. I'm not going to preach at you, bc I doubt it will be heard. Several other commentors have worded things well already, and I don't know your beliefs well enough to speak to you directly. But. I know God is real bc I'm not dead yet, and many other reasons besides. I also know that He has to step back and let us try, and fail, and grow and develop. We can't be flat Mary Sues, as the literary equivalents of never failing are known. It freakin hurts too. A relationship and belief in him isn't a get through life easy card. It's a steadfast rock of love to cry on sometimes, and stand proudly on in others.",

There was a bill in the legislature to increase to 90 percent which could be done without sacrifice in student quality.  Half of the population of Georgia is in Atlanta and SO many super qualified kids don't get in and end up going to OOS top tier schools instead.  This equals lots of mad parents and alumni.\n\nTheir solution is to increase transfers and increase freshman class size which puts increased strain on all areas, rather than increase in state percentage. Money is a small part of this but not the whole picture.\n\nA huge portion of the \"biggest school in the state\" is online masters programs where people don't step foot on campus and there is no infrastructure pressure so that is a little misleading.",

But then it's also wanting to get more rural students, more women, more students of color (without reducing the other cohorts), also as more students go towards stem degrees (nationwide), those colleges are in higher demand, plus Atlanta overall being a bigger destination for people worldwide...plus (and this is a softer stat) but they need to keep georgia politicians happy and those guys get really riled up with their kid with the 3.8 gpa doesn't get in and they can't figure out why. \nwith all that said, I'd keep the enrollment small and let the growth happen at other state colleges. (to contrast, MIT only has 5000 undergrads though its a bit deceptive to write that as 65% of their enrollment are grad students)",

Money allows GT to expand, to build new buildings (and we're doing soooo much building), to acquire top notch equipment and facilities. This in turn allows us to attract and hire top tier talent, not just at the facility level but also for positions like president. \n\nCriticism of such fast growth is well known and acutely felt at all levels: not enough instructors, not enough classrooms, not enough lab space for research, etc. I would agree we're growing too fast. But I also suspect that progress isn't kind to folks that move too slowly and to some extent it's necessary to move at the pace we're going to remain competitive.",

        "selftext": "Sorry if my post is disorganized\n\nI'm an international student, came here to do a master's in CS. This is my second semester, and academics-wise I'm doing fine, 4.0 GPA but that may change due to mental health issues and burnout.\n\nGonna be blunt, I just don't like the vibes here. Everyone's always too busy to go out, studying, working on their homework with their headphones on, etc etc. How do you meet people? What do you do after you're done working? Why aren't there more social events and mixers? The only way I made friends here is through clubs or approaching them in public (which is hard because everyone is always hurrying to their next class :/ )\n\nI mean don't get me wrong, there are fun people that do club activities but, those are usually once a week and it's really hard to form proper connections. You try to meet them outside of club hours, and everyone's busy with work. The only really sociable people I met were from frats, but a lot of them tended to have very toxic mindsets, especially towards girls, which I didn't like. I didn't know frats were a thing before coming to the US lol\n\nSpeaking of girls, how are you supposed to meet girls here?? I only dated 1 girl here so far, and I met her at a mixer during welcome week. I know that as a guy, I'm supposed to approach girls and be proactive but, how am I supposed to do that when all girls do here is study with their headphones on?\n\nI'm staying off campus very close to tech square. There are tons of amenities like a swimming pool, outdoors seatings, lots of rooms and screens that you might use to watch movies or play games. But noone uses them, they're always empty lmao. I guess people prefer to stay home and study. I want to know, is the situation better if you live on campus? Do the RA-s organize weekly social events? They used to do that at my previous college.\n\nWhat should I do? All of this + classes + pressure to find a job + TA work has been too much, and I'm cracking. My family noticed that I am depressed and burnt out. Having a gf really helped, cus I had someone I could see every day, but now I don't even have that haha.\n\nDo I change housing? Get a car and find friends at meetups and bars? Transfer? And if so, where? What colleges have a better work/life balance? Preferably with a smaller campus where I'd be living close to my friends and seeing them every day",

Can you reach out to people you sit beside in your classes for a study session? Then, that can turn into one on one or group activities if you have similar interests. Can you go to a club that\u2019s interesting to you and make a plan to study or hang out with those friends, too?\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult for some to maintain relationships when they don\u2019t occupy the same spaces as their friends. The people here are really great, but a lot of times, you\u2019ve got to reach out first- which can take a mental and emotional toll after a while. If you reach a relational burnout, it\u2019s okay to step back or change your social circle.\u00a0\n\nBest of luck, OP!",

I tried talking to them but most of them just look at you weird. That's probably why almost all of my friends are outside of CS.\n\nI've also been trying to get people to work on projects together on edstem and group chats, but noone answers lol.\n\nI want to transfer to a school with a smaller campus, where I can hang out with friends every day. I just can't here, I'm going insane, and it's turning me into a sad, depressed person. My old friend's can't recognize me.",

It\u2019s a super welcoming club and as a strange human myself I personally felt included and really enjoy getting to know everyone in the club!\n\nThe club meets four days a week (you choose however many days you want to go to) and post-practice meals are very common.

I\u2019ve also seen plenty of YJAC people hanging out outside of the club, so there\u2019s plenty of that. \n\nI think orientations are done for this semester (only four-ish weeks left), but over the summer / next fall you can totally join if you\u2019re looking for a club that does stuff outside the club itself!\n\nAs for relationships, I can\u2019t help you there lol.

Let's close Ferst, Hemphill, and possibly the bits of 8th and 9th inside campus to most cars, allowing access  only for deliveries, maintenance vehicles, and some special circumstances. The shuttles been be replaced by a nice efficient tram, while the parking lot underneath Klaus can be converted into 3 floors of desperately-needed CS classroom space! Other parking lots could also be put to more productive uses.\n\nI know it's crazy, but how hard would it be? Doing this would reduce pollution and noise, incentivise public transport use, improve safety, and make the overall campus ambiance more friendly!",

Does the section that still exists on campus actually impede pedestrians to any marked degree, given that pedestrian flow in that area is almost all parallel to it (i.e. going to/from the campus core)?\n\n* Atlantic used to go all the way from 10th to 4th, but is now 87% closed  (~2,300' vs ~200') to non-institute traffic.\n\n* There was a giant parking lot bounded by Van Leer, 4th, and the Architecture building.\n\n* There was a north/south road between the above-mentioned parking lot and Ferst. \n\n* There was a giant parking lot where Clough is now. \n\n* There was an east/west road on the north side of Van Leer between Atlantic and Ferst.\n\n* The area on Ferst where four Greek houses are across from Russ Chandler was a giant parking lot.\n\n* Bobby Dodd Way and the following section of Cherry Street up to Ferst were open to all traffic.\n\n* There was a u-shaped driveway north of the library with ~75 parking spots along it.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the core of campus within the area bounded by Ferst and Techwood is now open only to institute-only traffic.

That seems safe. \n\nSecondly, only a handful of Marta stations have long term parking, and they\u2019re $5-$8/day. That\u2019s a minimum of $700/semester. DOUBLE what I\u2019m already paying tech for parking. \n\nAll for what? Nothing. You have NO argument for why students shouldn\u2019t be able to bring their cars to campus. None. If you want to keep cars out of the middle of campus, that\u2019s fine. But if the school is going to do that, it needs to build adequate parking decks for students and staff elsewhere on campus.",

I remember it was somewhere in the span I could see when Tech got above a 3-average. Here's what I could see from the public one, filtered to undergrad only. Small technicality, but the average for *students* probably lags slightly behind the average for *classes,* and is skewed slightly by transfers and the varied time to graduate.\n\nEdit: can someone reply if the internal one goes further back?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0nvresrm5pc1.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80f06d429c1a5f3ce6df6e7a5277bd425a2ca22a",

They can just adjust grades with curves, or add too much material to be covered in an exam (like Sec+, or other Comptia tests), or go into too much detail with questions, or add too hard of questions to be completed within the time limit for an exam, etc. So grade inflation is likely a result of how classes are taught now, and schools' philosophy on how grading should work (e.g. only cover material seen, make extra effort to learn rewarded by a higher grade, etc.)\n\nI know that for OMSCS, at least, they are forcing us to learn mathematical proofs with a required algorithms class that uses them, and proofs are not in the curriculum. They also require a B average (3.0) to graduate, and B's or higher for classes in your specialization - so they can build the classes to require knowledge of certain topics to get a passing grade. I have already seen this in IIS, with problems worth 20% that cover a specific topic/exploit for a mini-project that distinguish between an 80% and 100% (straight, no curve, so a B or an A). So I can imagine them constructing overall classes this way as well, not just assignments.",

In my time as a student I've done a few SWE internships and, while I generally enjoyed the experience, it was hard to imagine myself doing that \"forever\" (even admitting that an internship is far from the intensity of a full-time career.) \n\nAs a result, I want to take a crack at undergrad research and see what the world of research and potentially academia are like. Seeing as I've still yet to complete my junior design option I'm seriously considering the research option as opposed to, say, working on a VIP. I had a few questions for anyone who has done the research option as a result:\n\n1) Did you find the research option useful to you long term? Would you have preferred to do a more industry focused choice like project-based/VIP?  \n2) Did you pursue grad school directly after graduation, or did you go into the workforce?   \n3) What was the outcome of the research option like for you? Was it just \\~9 hours of research work or did it result in anything like a journal publication, conference presentation, etc.?  \n4) And most importantly... do you recommend the research option for someone looking to try someone new?\n\nThoughts and answers to any of these questions would be greatly appreciated.

It's certainly helped me enhance my technical writing skills (which imo everyone should have decent experience with in today's industry). I'm personally leading my own research under faculty advisement (through UROP), which is why I prefer it to group-based project options like CREATE-X, VIP, or capstone. I know most research options involve joining a lab, though you could always try reaching out to a faculty if there's a particular project you had in mind.\n2. I'm planning to pursue grad school more or less immediately after undergrad (planning to take a 7-month gap for one semester + the summer, as I'm graduating in a fall semester)\n3. I did 3 hours of research for another research team in my freshman year. Last summer, I did the asynchronous proposal writing class. This semester and last have been research semesters for my project. I'm taking the asynchronous thesis writing class this summer. The goal is to finish data collection this semester/this summer, spend the summer writing my thesis, and have it published in a journal by the summer.\n4. The research option is not for the faint of heart, especially UROP - it requires a lot more independence than capstone or VIP might (no idea how CREATE-X compares tbh). Having said that, if you're disciplined with your time management and commitments, when else are you going to have the chance to just casually try out research like this? Make sure you're working on something you're actually passionate about (don't just join/start a research project if you're not at all interested in it, as it gets a lot tougher to try and stay engaged).\n\nOverall, I can definitely recommend the research option (especially UROP). Be mindful of it and don't do it just to try \\*something\\* new. But if research is something you really want to try and you're passionate about or interested in the subject at hand: why not give it a shot? Ultimately, it's a choice based on your interests, your own time management/discipline, and your plans for the future (grad school, etc.) I've really enjoyed it\n\nP.S.

                "body": "I'm a second-year whose been conducting research for 2-3 semesters, so I can tell you about my experiences so far!\n\n2. I'm definitely planning on pursuing grad school directly after graduation. Like you, I haven't been overly enthused with software engineering so far (I want to spend my life solving hard, research-style problems instead of developing infrastructure or managing some kubernetes cluster). I honestly really love the research we do and working in the lab is probably the first thing I could actually clearly see myself doing \"forever,\" so grad school is the natural next step.\n\n3. I basically spent my first two semester just learning a LOT. I work in AI/controls and there are some incredibly math-heavy papers and unfamiliar concepts that I had to understand to get up to speed. I didn't spend as much time on research during those two semesters (maybe 6-ish hours a week) as I do now (closer to 15). In retrospect, I probably could've started working on projects after less time learning; but, I wanted a deeper understanding of the field and the grad students who've been mentoring me were happy to support me through that! \n\nThis semester, I'm getting paid and starting to really work on paper-able projects. I'll likely have a not-first author paper out soon as I'm helping a grad student run experiments. I'm leading a few projects which will hopefully yield a first-author publication (or two) sometime later this year. Ultimately, I plan on continuing to conduct research for the remainder of my time at Tech and I'd conservatively expect to publish maybe 4-5 papers (1-2 of which are first-author). This is just my prediction based on very limited experience, though!\n\n4. Yes! I tried research semi-arbitrarily tbh, but I've fallen in love. I love the team that I work with and the new things that I learn and I'm excited to start publishing to get something out there! \n\nHowever, it should be mentioned that research is hard and time-consuming. You get what you put into it. Each three-credit class is meant to be 9 hours of work per week, and you probably won't gain much unless you put in somewhere around that, on average. How your research goes is entirely up to you. You could spend the entire time learning nothing, not asking questions and barely understanding a paper or two, or, you could publish several papers and truly engage yourself in the lab (even in just those three semesters / nine credits). \n\nHow much work you're willing to put into \"something new\" is up to you!",

                "body": "As someone who used to work in a lab (with students doing research under me), I'd tell them that you will have your entire career to work within the constraints of industry, take the opportunity to do research you'll be proud to have worked on when you get the chance. Independent research shows above and beyond that you are a self-starter. That's the kind of person you want to hire in the entry-level: someone who can take a directive and largely figure it out without hand-holding (while not being so stubborn not to ask questions when blockers arise). \n\nSpeaking of \"something new\".... One of the students that worked with me years ago primarily did research on learning AI for fighting games by monitoring the game state in memory (I think, technically it was a bit above my head). A good advisor will let you go in the direction you are truly passionate about while giving you guidance to keep you focused on reaching the goals you set at the beginning of a semester. Choosing a subject you are genuinely interested in makes it feel like a relief from your regular classwork, rather than a burden. You'll need the right faculty fit for this approach. The best audition is taking a class taught by a faculty member you want to do research with, if possible.\n\nDon't focus on outcomes, focus on process. That being said, the bar to do a poster presentation is not very high and is a good entry point to publication as an undergrad. \"Presented at PRESTIGIOUS\\_CONFERENCE\" is good enough, poster presentation or no. Most people outside academia don't know the difference between a paper or poster, anyway.\n\nIf you plan to go to grad school, having faculty that can vouch for you is an incredible advantage. I know it carries admission weight, again largely because doing independent research shows you are a self-starter.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone! I wanted to share an exciting extracurricular leadership opportunity for those of you who are already involved in research.\u00a0Undergraduate Research Ambassadors (URA) is a peer mentoring organization within Georgia Tech's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program. The ambassadors help other students navigate the research process by holding weekly office hours and organizing events throughout the semester. Mentoring opportunities range from helping students join a lab to guiding them through the application process for scholarships like the President's Undergraduate Research Award (PURA).\u00a0Applications to join URA for Fall 2024 are currently open, and they will close next Sunday,\u00a0March 24th. The application consists of a streamlined form at this [link,](https://urop.gatech.edu/content/undergraduate-research-ambassador-guidelines-and-application) as well as a faculty recommendation\u00a0(which is also due on Sunday, March 24th). Feel free to check out our [website](https://urop.gatech.edu/content/undergraduate-research-ambassadors) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gt_ura/) for more information. I am currently an ambassador, so feel free to ask any questions, and I will do my best to answer them! ",

                        "body": "I am very sorry to hear about the ghosting! I think cold emailing is the most common way to join a lab, but there are plenty of other options. I personally joined a lab through a summer REU in a Georgia Tech lab, so I would suggest looking into some of those if you are free this summer. Even if it's not an official REU program, I have heard that joining a lab is easier in the summer because there are less people on campus. You can also reach out to a former class instructor that does research, since they are much less likely to ignore you if they know you personally. \n\nIf that doesn't help, I would suggest going to an undergraduate research fair/showcase, since a lot of lab PIs and grad students go to those because they *want* to recruit undergraduate students for their labs. You also get an added benefit of meeting potential PIs and grad students in-person rather than over email. URA hosts an undergraduate research fair every fall, but some departments have their own fairs, as well (I know mine does)\u2014so keep an eye out for networking events like that. There is also URA's annual [Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://calendar.gatech.edu/event/2024/04/16/undergraduate-research-spring-symposium) coming up next month, which will mostly have undergraduate students presenting, but there should be some professors there, as well. \n\nFinally, you can check out the Pair Me [website](https://pairme.aep.gatech.edu/); it is basically a database covering research and VIP opportunities at Georgia Tech, but unfortunately, I think most students don't know about it. Lots of labs put out job postings on there if they are looking for undergraduate students to help out in their lab. I hope this helps, and good luck!",

Both were less stressful than I expected and felt more like a conversation than an interview!\n\nSomething I *always* recommend is reading about the research projects in the lab you want to join before the interview, since it shows that you are interested in what they do. No one will expect you to know everything about your lab's area of expertise at this stage, but a little bit of preparation can go a long way! \n\nThe dress code honestly depends on context. Formal clothes would probably be best if you're interviewing for a very competitive REU, but if you're just meeting a professor you cold emailed, business casual will suffice. I personally wore dress pants and a nice blouse for both of my interviews. There is also nothing wrong with emailing the interview organizers to ask about the dress code.",

Time spent practicing/coding is more important than a lot of the theory.\n\nI can't think of any engineering discipline where that is true.

As others have said, Georgia Tech purposefully took specific action to prevent the very thing you are trying to do.   \n\nAs in, the college of computing already has sooo many students with sooo many other undergrads switching their majors to CS that they made the decision to eliminate this pipeline.\n\nThe best programmers I knew at Tech were EE or MATH majors anyway.   If you have your heart set on a career in programming then absolutely nothing is stopping you from taking many of the same classes that CS folks take, or unofficially auditing courses and learning the material yourself.\n\nMost companies who recruit CS from Tech will also consider CS adjacent majors.... the drawback is that the CMPE and EE curricula are tougher than CS.   IE is also worth a look, but its not as intuitively similar in most people's minds, i think.",

Banner is (currently) hard-wired to work with Oracle's RDBMS and runtime suite. Of the major SIS (Student Information System) offerings, it's the one with the largest market share and has an international reach. The vendor has around 3,000 Banner  customers...where the ENTIRE University System of Georgia (USG) counts as ONE such customer.  GT, being a unit of the USG, naturally uses the product ; in fact we ended up as the test case for it in 1996, before the USG adopted it systemwide. \n\nOh -- Ellucian is jointly owned by Blackstone and Vista.\n\nThe \"new\" Banner 9 registration system in Banner (which we call OSCAR) exists for 2 main reasons. A) Oracle has end-of-lifed the fundamental technology whereby web pages are rendered by stored procedures in the database. B) Ellucian is working to push all their clients into their SaaS (Software as a Service) universe -- which uses a PostgeSQL database (junking/replacing several million lines of Oracle PL/SQL in the process of escaping Oracle's egregious licensing fees).\n\nThe new product is written in Java -- with all the benefits and blemishes that implies.\n\nGeorgia Tech (and the USG) is almost a decade late in converting to Banner 9 registration.\n\nDoes that help?",

I strongly encourage everyone to exercise their right and voice their opinions on the candidates through voting. Yes this isn\u2019t actual politics, but this can truly change the way GT finances RSOs, bringing cultural  opinions to admin, and creating a much better pool of  mental health resources.\n Consider voting for AP and Cole!!\n\nVoting link: https://www.sga.gatech.edu/elections/\n\nInstagram: APandCole ",

        "selftext": "So yesterday I dropped a class for the first time since I've been here (I'm a 3rd Year) because I bombed a midterm that was worth 40% of my grade. The class is pretty test heavy(i.e. the only things that affect the grade are the midterm and the final). I had studied so much, and came to class basically everytime, and even I helped a classmate who did well study. Even the professor was surprised I did so badly. I guess  it must have been an off day. I talked to my advisor and he suggested I drop the class. \n\nI understand that withdrawing from a class won't screw me over long term, especially considering that I have a high GPA in a hard major (AE) but I'm still feeling down about the fact that I dropped a class and have been in an emotional and mental slump for the past 24 hours. Any tips on getting past this?",

The first semester of my MSAE program here I failed a midterm, refused to withdraw since I thought I could stick it out, and ended up getting an F in the class.\n\nI have two takeaways from that: first, my previous success made me blind to my potential failures. Just because I did well in the past doesn\u2019t mean I get to rest on my laurels. Second, know when to call it quits. I had an insane courseload and really could\u2019ve used the extra study time elsewhere instead of wasting it failing for that second half of the semester. It would\u2019ve been much better for my mental health and GPA to just take the W.\n\nI think you made the right choice. You aren\u2019t the first and won\u2019t be the last to have an uncharacteristically bad exam grade. Happens all the time, and your life will absolutely go on just fine.",

I had him and his course was 40% midterm, 60% final and he didn\u2019t assign any readings or homework either. \n\nIf it\u2019s any consolation, I did the exact opposite as you. I made a 100 on the midterm (even though I spoke with friends after and know for a fact I made mistakes on the exam), so I felt pretty good about the final. I took the final, never got a score back, then final grades were posted and I made a C in the course. I emailed Kardomateas to ask for a bump and he said I made a 72 in the course and wasn\u2019t getting it. I guess you can do the math to figure out what I made on the final but I never bothered.\n\nMy advice is to not let it shake you. You\u2019re going to have good days and bad days, and you just got unlucky your bad day happened on a big midterm day. If my hunch is right that this was Kardomateas, I especially wouldn\u2019t let that sway you because he was an awful professor.",

This was before the expansion of both 75/85 (4 lanes/side then, 8 lanes/side now) and the street right in front of Turner (4 lanes then, 8 lanes now).  There was a motel at the north end and looking on [Historic Aerials](https://historicaerials.com/viewer), the strip was ~80 yards wide.",

There are a few occasional events at various other venues/bars throughout the area (Star Bar and more).\n\nI think the only one coming up this weekend is [Sputnik](https://www.boggssocial.com/events/sputnik-atlantas-dark-alternative-music-video-night), but I've not been to that one myself.\n\nThere are usually only a handful of DJs that play goth events here, so attend a few events to figure out which one(s) play the music you like, and follow them on social media.\n\nEdit after realizing what sub this is: A lot of goth nights are 21+, so check the flyers. The crowds also tend to be older than college age, so bear that in mind; mostly late-20s+.\n\nEdit 2: Apparently I linked the right event but for a past instance; I have corrected the link.",

And all those beautiful azaleas that are synonymous with the South are non-natives as well. There is a native azalea called the Piedmont azalea, which is gorgeous but not nearly as widely used, probably because it is deciduous.",

BST Remove, Quicksort, etc.), you break it down into what each line of code is accomplishing, and write out that line. Then you turn that line-by-line description of the algorithm into a mnemonic device/acronym that you will memorize. The second you get that exam paper, write out the mnemonic device at the top right corner, and then reference it to make sure you don\u2019t miss a single step. If done correctly, even looking at the letter \u201cA\u201d will remind you to add the node to a list, or whatever. \n\nJust what worked for me, good luck!",

Usually, memorization will lead to a decent score, but will lead to errors on certain leetcode-like questions on the exam where memorizing certain algorithms could yield incorrect answers (Think the most recent BST challenge question). Instead understanding the algorithms before the exam then applying the technique used to create the algorithm will help you excel, and even help you become a better software engineer.\n\nIf you want a good idea on how to prep for the coding questions or maybe the multiple choice/diagramming, go to Office Hours and ask one of the TAs on duty to walk through how they take one on the practice exams or maybe a specific question from the exam. This way you are able to receive live feedback on your approach to solving the questions or maybe a learn a new way to tackle the questions on exams. Id be happy to walk through questions from the exam to show my thought process for some of the questions when I was taking it if you pull up to office hours or make a private post on piazza about it (my notifs r on so I can help ASAP if it's on there).\n\nI also suggest going to recitation the day before the exam. Depending on the TA, we will go over the process for solving common exam questions (usually on the worksheets we give out), maybe walk through a coding question, then take any questions regarding taking the exam or content that could be covered on the exam. Overall, just make sure to understand the topics in depth and situations where a certain algorithm might be applicable. Don't stress about it, you got this :)",

Personally I agree complete memorization is not the move but neither is no memorization. Write the code again from scratch by thinking through the logic ( do this in black pen) come back and fill in ur errors in another color and understand WHY u made those mistakes/forgot. Did you not understand the data structure construction? Was it silly syntax (like incrementing a size var)? Are u missing a concept you need to review (like recursion or pointer reinforcement)? Then keep writing it over and over again with the same process and you will begin to see patterns in where you struggle. For me it was recursion and pointer reinforcement but by the time the test rolled around I understood it. So to an extent you should have them memorized through logic bc of the time crunch if that makes sense? It\u2019s not brute force. But it involves memorizing.",

This is because \"normal\" maths is straightforward, one equality leads to another and after doing tedious algebra, you are done. However, in physics, you can \"skip\" a lot of steps usually. This usually means to observe a phenomenon, or realizing a physical fact, and you use it in your equality, which would not have been possible if  you didn't have an understanding of physics. Additionally, it is harder to set up initial equations in physics because you need to understand the problem. Luckily, you can study both the same way, do a lot of problems, redo them, and deeply think why the steps are true. I am sure the professors said it, but reading solution is not the same as doing problems.\n\nMath on a higher level changes a lot, and is much more interesting, you will see something in CS2050, but imo it is not the best taught/designed class. You should try doing upper level math if you find it easy.",

I was so worried about the cars who sped RIGHT by me while I played ball with bumpy pavement. Likely didn't help that I was having some issues with my bike. Besides, you still have to rejoin the sidewalk eventually to get to most buildings, bike racks, etc. Pedestrians walk proudly down the center of all the mixed traffic sidewalks, so me carefully going down the right side of the sidewalk (and yielding to all pedestrians) really doesn't give me an ounce of guilt.",

There's also the fact that electric buses are expensive and the current transportation fee wouldn't cover it. Public schools that got electric buses almost always had state or federal grants to foot the bill. Bringing electric buses to Tech would cost tens of millions. They're in PTS' roadmap but the funding isn't concrete and we won't get electric buses until we know where the money is coming from. \n\nTrolleybuses are another solution but the overhead wires are unsightly and I bet there are other reasons we don't see them on college campuses.",

You, most likely, have a really good group of friends that you hang out with some times, but are craving this \u201cmovie friendship.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, this \u201cmovie friendship\u201d does not exist. There will be times when your friends are there for you and times when they are not. I, personally, have amazing roommates, but some times they all are gone over the weekend and I have no one there to listen to my problems, and that feels isolating.\n\nI bring this up to show you, if you have friends, the only thing preventing them from becoming deeper connections is yourself (or themself).\n\n\u201cBut, random stranger on the internet, how do I go about creating this deeper connection??\u201d You might be asking. It\u2019s simple. If it\u2019s guy friends you\u2019re talking to, it honestly might be worthwhile to just straight up say \u201chey man, I want to talk about more personal matters and be there for each other emotionally more often.\u201d Guys are relatively receptive to this and usually want to have deeper connections (like you) with their friends, but societal constructs have made it hard.\n\nAnother method that works is \u201chey man, I truly appreciate you. And I want you to know if you ever need to talk about anything, I\u2019m here for you.\u201d\n\nSide note: NEVER text these things (if it\u2019s the first time saying it), these can be uncomfortable to say, but that stress is what makes it so much more meaningful.\n\nAll this to say, figure out WHAT exactly you want by \u201cdeeper connections\u201d and really attempt to get that out of your current friend group",

I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t be in a relationship if you have mental health challenges, but it\u2019s not a great start to be looking for a partner because you want them to fix you. \n\nThis may be an odd suggestion, but it\u2019s what helped me when I was looking for community and social connection after a breakup a couple years ago\u2014 have you tried social groups with a broader age range? I joined a discussion group and book club through a church and found them to be really helpful for getting to know people and generally expand my social circle. (I\u2019m not really religious, but it was a Unitarian church so they were welcoming anyway.) I get the sense you\u2019re focused on the potential for romantic connection, but may actually be more in need of platonic connection and a local emotional support network. That may come easier from older adults rather than other university students who are wrapped up in their own stuff.",

Just treat them the same as guys and make friends with them. Once you have a few friends that are girls you\u2019ll be more comfortable with talking to them and understand how to communicate better. Hopefully some of their female friends are single and would be open to going to dinner with you. \n\n\nFrom reading this, I think you might not be ready for a girlfriend but are kind of craving emotional support and connection, which your friends can definitely provide. Being friends with women could show you they\u2019re not the magic solution you\u2019re making them out to be. Although I would definitely recommend it- most of the women I\u2019ve met here are hardworking, high achieving, and intelligent- they\u2019re pretty girlboss.",

However, I have no prior experience of working in a library.\n\nI would appreciate any advice or suggestions from students who currently work or have worked in GT library before. How was the process? I think working at the front desk or printing department is the most suitable as I am not from IT background. Thank you.",

I'm broadly interested in specializing in compressible fluid dynamics which I intend to continue studying for my PhD.\n\nI'm really keen on joining the program, but I'm beginning to feel that Tech's Aero department is a whole lot more active on the combustion side of things, and most of the aerodynamics research (computational and experimental) is focused on rotorcraft. By contrast, UIUC aero seems to be active in all spheres of aerospace engineering.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that GT is more of a rotorcraft-focused school, or am I missing something here? Can someone give an overview of the aerodynamics work at GT? Thanks!",

While I'm not all that familiar with the vertical lift lab, I do know about two other labs active in the field. \n\nThe first is the Ben T. Zinn Combustion Laboratory. The second is the Aerospace Design Laboratory (ASDL), which primarily focuses on systems engineering and vehicle optimization. Although ASDL's main emphasis is not on compressible fluid dynamics, there are numerous opportunities to engage in projects related to CFD and high-speed aerodynamic design. However, ASDL has limited experimental capabilities as it is not their main focus.\n\nOn the other hand, as you mentioned, the Combustion Lab and the Computational Combustion Lab are heavily involved in both computational and experimental work related to compressible flow, although in the realm of combustion dynamics. There are a few projects I am aware of that work with computational compressible flow on the aerodynamics side inside the combustion lab, but it depends on the project.\n\nOf course, this is coming from someone who isn't involved on the aerodynamics side so take it with a grain of salt, but I hope this helps!",

I use it maybe once a month, if that, and I\u2019ve been trying to get rid of it. I use it so little that I didn\u2019t even know it was booted. The fees are now nearly $600 when my car is worth maybe $900. \n\nI won\u2019t pay that. I\u2019m trying to finish my PhD  and that fee will ruin my life in my current financial situation. My car is basically worthless as is and I\u2019d be just fine just getting rid of it. The boot company can have the car for all I care. I just want the car out of my life.\n\nIf anyone wants to have this car and is capable of dealing with the boot (financially or otherwise), it\u2019s all yours. It\u2019s a 2010 Subaru legacy. It starts and drives (sans boot). It\u2019s got a fresh oil change. It\u2019s got some mechanical problems (blown head gasket, starting to be worn front brakes). \n\nYou can literally have it for free. The reduction in stress would be priceless to this yellow jacket right now. \n\n**EDIT: Car has been claimed!**",

The research option states that\u2019s you have to have 5 out of 9 research for credit (the other four can be audited), which means 5cr CS 4699 and 4hrs CS 4698. The exact statement was also apparent in the CS junior design completion guidelines, but underneath it there was a requirements section which showed 3 credits as options between CS 4699/CS 4980 and the other 6 as strictly CS 4980. I don\u2019t know the difference between these two, and I really want to audit some hours in the summer to avoid paying expensive tuition. Is it possible to audit 5 hrs for RO in CS junior design? How many hours of 4980 do you have to have?\n\nThank you in advance for those answering my question.",

I am in-state and I was thinking if I there is any way I could take classes at GSU to quickly finish all my humanities and history requirements. I didn't come in with credit for these and I feel like doing those over the summer at GSU will be easy and will help me take fewer classes when my coursework gets harder over the next couple of years. How does the application process work if I am able to do this and what you would suggest? Thank you for your time.",

I don't recommend doing them during the summer or at another school.\n\nIf anything, I'd take the hard core classes like Math and Science/Lab electives at a Georgia Perimeter college or GSU during the Summer instead since they'll be easier than doing them at Tech. And you'll get them out of your way. You'll want your hard classes during the main semesters to be only your major courses, adding hard sciences/math on top of that makes your life much harder than just having an easy humanity taking up space instead.",

So it is possible, but you'll have to come in with quite a few credit hours and take a higher than normal course load to do it (including some summer semesters). \n\nHopefully this advice isn't outdated. Also, other people might have different opinions, and YMMV.\n\nYou should make sure you genuinely enjoy both majors. I think the general consensus is that having a second undergrad degree doesn't make you more employable than having one undergrad degree + internship/co-op experience. So you probably shouldn't do this if your motivation is just to get a job (although maybe there are some niche jobs that need both EE and Math knowledge, idk for sure.)\n\nIf you can afford it, taking 4.5-5 years to double major might not be too bad, especially since you'll have a lower course load each semester. I don't think employers or grad schools will look at that too negatively.\n\nIn EE, you'll probably want to take classes in signal processing, control systems, and/or info theory as those are the more math heavy areas of EE. \n\nFinally, try not to take Real Analysis and Abstract Algebra in the same semester since those will likely have proof intensive homeworks due regularly. You don't want to pull two late/all nighters each week.\n\nThat's all the advice I can think of right now. Good luck!",

But if you're really interested in mathematics, and you're good at building intuition for math by yourself, and it's more recreational/curiosity based for you rather than based on career interests, I would just major in EE and learn the math on your own later on. The reason is that all the rigour and heavy workload in mathematics classes (or any subject for that matter) in my opinion doesn't translate well into *actual understanding* of the topic, just the ability to churn out results, with the drawback of having to do countless of exercises that the professors want you to do, rather than the ones that actually interest *you*. All the while, not giving you additional employability benefits. In fact, just putting down that you're interested in mathematics and read a lot on maths on your resume will already boost your chances of getting an EE job -- no need for that extra degree, unless the job specifically requires it. That will give you more time to learn mathematics in the way that interests *you*, and if you're talented this will actually be more productive and give you more long-term advantage.",

If the institute/college actually cared about funding these scholarships, I'm sure that allocating just 5k from the 70k overhead for each phd student per year would fund plenty of undergrad and omscs scholarship recipients",

Think wiffle ball on steroids. \n\nHere\u2019s a video of an example game\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8jH2JEL84Fo?si=DZhruFsvbEaZgM4B\n\nOur club rules will be slightly different, and we don\u2019t have massive dedicated mini-stadiums, but you get the idea.\n\nParticipation costs nothing, and we\u2019re looking to grow the sport in the area, so we plan to start slow and build up, so it\u2019s a perfect way to get off campus and meet new people, as well as something fun to do with friends!\n\nHere\u2019s the discord we\u2019re going to use to organize games\n\nhttps://discord.gg/cumjWrHX\n\nReach out if you have any questions; I hope to see you on the field!\n\n",

I go to the website and pick a package as I'm checking out and put in the promo code I got after registering for an account. It said invalid promo code, mind you the GradImages people were there giving out flyers that said register your account for a promo code. So I went to Google to look for a number to call and saw the reviews and wowwww, they have a 1.4-star rating with sooo many people complaining about never getting their pics in the mail or getting poor quality pics AND the promo codes not working. Why does GT still use these people?  Anyways, any recs for local studios in Atlanta for grad pics or local photographers because the reviews are off-putting, not gonna pay for that!!!  \n\n\nTLDR: GradImages seems to do bad business, please recommend some photographers and or local studios for grad pics.  \n ",

When I was at GSU, I was a little successful in getting positive interactions and meeting girls but it\u2019s worse here. I have no hope for dating at all either. It gets lonely a little now that I\u2019m in dorms this semester, but I try to keep busy to not think about it as much.\n\nI might be complaining a little here, but I just wanted to know if anyone feels/felt the same way.

Go to some of their meetings, and maybe sign up for a trip or two. It\u2019s incredibly cheap and incredibly fun.\n\n(3) Intramural sports \u2014 there\u2019s random groups of people playing sports at STAMPS all the time.

She's in the dorms too, but is planning to move into an apt this summer. This year, she doesn't have a single friend at school. She's met a few ppl through the apps (for friendship and dating), but hasn't really landed 'her people' yet and she is so incredibly lonely. I have absolutely no idea if you two would have anything in common and  or if you're at all interested, but I'd be happy to ask her if it was okay for me to share her contact info and you guys could go meet up for coffee or a meal or whatever and see if you spark up a friendship. Or just text at first and see if you guys seem to vibe, then make plans to meet up. She's 20, will be 21 in October. (**If this is not allowed, I am SO sorry. About to go check rules as soon as I post this and I'll come right back to delete it immediately if it's not supposed to be here**) I know reddit's all about anonymity and there's always the crazies out there, so if you aren't interested, then my sincere apologies- please know my intent was pure.

Urban Analytics seems like a good fit for me, but I\u2019m also interested in taking courses such as CP 6233: Sustainable Urban Development and CP 6545: Climate Change Analytics. Would it also be possible to cross-register? For reference, my undergraduate studies is within environmental sciences.",

Early courses such as 1331 and 1332 are in person paper for instance (oop and data structures) and even 2110 sometimes is depending on the prof which is the basis for a lot of the more hands on courses.\n\nMath courses and other are all in person paper too.\n\nThere are ***some*** hybrid / online options, but the consensus is that you only register for those as a last resort imo since you're forced to learn solely online vs at least having the option of an inperson class and help if you sign up for in person sections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of us (myself included) are guilty of skipping and tbf it's entirely a valid option if you learn better alone, but for a lot of coures, you can't really have a better/faster time than with lectures and being able to talk to your profs and TAs. There tends to be a lot of internal mobility though beween sections of large courses (e.g. if im signed up for prof A in section A and I just decide to go to prof B's lectures cause i understand them better). It really depends a lot on your ability to force yourself to focus and work on your own, and the support network you build with friends and peers in the same classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImportant to note as well: a lot of core classes require attendance or something along those lines. E.g. from my experience:\n\n\\- Combinatorics\n\n\\- Psych\n\n\\- Probability and statistics\n\n\\- 2110 and 2200 (though tbf these can be done via reading the slides afterwards for lectures -- labs require physical tap in id card attendance sometimes)\n\n\\- etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of classes have recordings but an equal amount if not more don't.

                "body": "I transferred last Fall 2023, I used the REPP program. My previous college didn\u2019t offer any engineering degrees. I am a veteran so people say that is a lil bit of a boost during the acceptance process, but it\u2019s not a proven thing. I failed 3 courses at before transferring and the grades replaced by taking those courses again. I had a 3.84 GPA, no research or extracurricular activities linked to the school. I was able to technically apply using the REPP pathway and the veterans pathway but they accepted me under the REPP. I explained all of my circumstances about failing classes and I did do volunteer work as well as tutoring at the library for free since I was often there to study and my ex girlfriend was a tutor that would get swamped with students and needed extra help so all the students got tutored. They offered me a student tutoring position while I was there but I turned it down because I did to help not for money and if it became a job I wouldn\u2019t like doing it as much. I mentioned all this on my application as well as making several drafts for the application essays and having several people look through them to make sure they were top notch. I don\u2019t think my application was anything special, but I think your essays do matter a good bit because it\u2019s not just academic standing they are looking for. They want to make sure you are a good fit for GA Tech morally and ethically. As well as having drive and aspirations. You may have been waitlisted but don\u2019t give up!",

I am trying to get an idea of my financial situation, and have created a preliminary budget. \n\nI'll be making about $2600 a month after taxes, and the apartments I have looked at (1br) range from \\~1350-1450 a month. \n\nThe part I could use help on are the extra monthly fees that most apartments dont tell you until you apply. Specifically things like electricity, water, and gas usage. I know these depend on how much you actually use, but I am just trying to get a rough idea. Currently I have budgeted about $150/month for these costs. Is this reasonable ?\n\nAs a reference, In my current apartment I use about \\~200 kWh per month (for electricity). \n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqsdb186zylc1.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2414588893825434d05e599e7a7f80ac3f869b3",

                "body": "Hopefully this info can be useful to somebody. Like many of you, my HireRight background check has been held up for over six weeks now. I originally submitted it on February 18th. Since then, I have called HireRight multiple times and was even able to reach their escalation team.\n\nAccording to the representatives I spoke to from HireRight, the consensus is that the criminal and court check for Fulton County is the cause of all the delays. Even though on March 15th, Fulton provided a new way for third party companies to complete their background check on ResearchGA. However, the HireRight representative noted that they could not use ResearchGA because it does not include all the information, or the information is not up to date. They also claimed that their professionals were working on it. Some in this post have suggested that re-submitting a background check would make it go faster, but the HireRight representatives were not sure if this was a good idea.\n\nMoreover, any deadlines or dates that they have are completely arbitrary and not able to be trusted. We also called Fulton County, and they say that they never provide deadlines or ETAs. As a result, please take whatever dates HireRight gives you with a massive grain of salt.\n\nAs for the actual solution to this problem, I reached out to my company's team responsible for background checks, and they provided me with an attestation. An attestation just says that you do not have any criminal actions on your record. After filling this out, my company would allow me to continue the onboarding process.\n\nI would highly encourage everyone to reach out to their recruiters and hiring managers immediately, explaining the situation. Most HR departments should already be aware of the situation with Fulton County and will be ready to help you. Continuing communication with your hiring company is key in this situation.",

                "body": "\n\n**Update: it\u2019s been completed!! Here\u2019s my full timeline below:\n\nMar 27 - I sent the email to company &amp; HireRight and called HireRight\n\nMar 28 - I received the additional form &amp; submitted\n\nMar 31 - Portal updated with a comment from HireRight team that listed form as \u201cforwarded to State Police\u201d\n\nApril 2 - Background check completed by State of GA police\n\n-~-~-~-~-~-~-\n\nHi all - hopefully this is helpful for some. My process is not closed yet - and if it continues to delay, I will ask my HR rep about an Attestation form like @economy-leading5544 suggested. Or - if it wraps up and completes, I\u2019ll provide an update here. \n\nHere is the email I sent to my company\u2019s HR rep WITH the hire right service email on CC. Immediately after sending, I called the hire right help number (waited on hold for forever) and walked them (verbatim) through the email to force action. The HireRight rep didn\u2019t know what I was talking about (even though shouldn\u2019t they be the ones notifying me of this??) - so I had them click the article, asked them if they read it in totality, etc. \n\nThere\u2019s now a note on my check in hireright that says my request was \u201cescalated.\u201d Shortly after I received the form others have mentioned about signing off for a state-level background check. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nHere\u2019s my email:\n\nSubject: Fulton County Issue &amp; Remediation - Re: Congratulations on your offer! \n\nHi [HR REP NAME], \n\n01. BACKGROUND\n\nHope you are doing well! As I'm incredibly excited to get started - I've been monitoring the progress of my background check. \n\nAccording to the HireRight portal, it looks like it is ##% complete - with the main variable not yet complete being my Atlanta (Fulton County) criminal &amp; offense record. While all other cities seemed to clear within a day or two of the request, this one is still pending so I decided to look into it a bit. \n\n\n02. Issue - TLDR\n\nIt appears that &lt;[Fulton County experienced a cybersecurity incident early this year](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/news/2024/03/15/fulton-county-incident-response-update-for-march-15-2024)&gt; that has affected their ability to provide this information through county requests. (Source: fultoncountga.gov).\n\nNaturally, as one does, I ended up on a &lt;[Reddit forum about this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1b4twfr/anyone_else_waiting_for_hireright_background_check/)&gt; where many others were experiencing (and are still experiencing) the same issue. (Source: reddit r/gatech).\n\n\n03. Solution - TLDR\n\nHowever, both the forum and the official state communication have provided a solution saying that:\n\"Third-Party Background Checks\nThird-party background checks completed by accessing court records were affected by the outage. Those checks can now be completed following the transition to a new record search site. Companies conducting third party searches should now access records through re:SearchGA at https://researchga.tylerhost.net/\"\n\n\n04. My Quick Ask\n\nWould you be able to look into this for me and confer with the HireRight team that they use the state-recommended site to access records in order to expedite the process of my background check? \n\nThanks in advance for any help you may be able to provide!",

The part east of midtown was very chill (very bougie neighbourhood). Didn\u2019t have any trouble with midtown as well, there were lots of drunk people, so it felt okay. \n\nOverall, didn\u2019t really feel unsafe at any point. Thanks again for all the advice.\n\nP.S. yall should watch Dune 2 at a theatre, the sound just by itself is a 10/10 imo.",

If any of you saw a post I made earlier this week about a housing dilemma I had (ended up deleting it because I thought it was too niche of an issue), I got it resolved!\n\nAnyway, my actual post is about y'alls experience living in some of the on-campus apartments. My friends and I are rising 2nd years and are hoping to get into Crecine, but we wanted to have some backup options in case that doesn't happen. I currently live in NAV North (accoms), which has definitely been something (if you live here you already know LOL). Despite that, I do like the convenience of the dining hall being right there, and also having laundry.\n\nIf any of y'all have lived in the following apartments, please feel free to share what your experience was like! Just want ideas on which buildings to prioritize for backups.\n\n* NAV South, East\n* Crecine (#1 choice)\n* Zbar\n* GLC (since it's apparently for undergrads now?)\n* 8th Street\n* Center Street\n* Nelson-Shell\n* Maulding",

Shower was fine though\n\n- AC/Heating was very old meaning that you can't set it to a specific temperature, so it would keep running until you manually turned it off, no matter how hot or cold it got.",

It makes it a pain in the ass if two people are cooking bc you have to do the weird squeeze behind thing, but in terms of everything else it's a solid building. I've heard decent things about Eighth and Z-Bar. Apparently Nelson Shell had roaches at one point? Could be hearsay.",

There were several supply chain issues that slowed this down.\n\n* We are also expecting 4 more treadmills to arrive any day now to help alleviate some of the broken ones.\n\n* Peter's parking deck is open. We are still process-improving on how things work out there. We've gotten great feedback thus far.\n\n* Ken Byers will have inconsistent hours now that NCAA tennis is in season. It is important to check the GTAA schedule before showing up for open play. \n\nAs always you can message me or reply to this thread - I do my best to reply here.\n\nIf you have any questions about our operations or other general CRC questions, please email us or visit our [website](https://www.crc.gatech.edu/).

CS TAs at comparable universities start earning at $20/hour, we're earning at $8. TAing a time-intensive class like 2200 doesn't even let you get paid in your first semester as a TA. It's not even a cost-of-living argument, Atlanta isn't cheap by any metric. I get that pay shouldn't be the primary motivator to be a TA, but $8/hour is honestly quite ridiculous given how many hours we put in and the quality of work expected.",

Unfortunately, GT is a public school - so these policies are probably set by men/women who are so far removed from the common college student and working adult that it\u2019s disgusting.\n\nGT should really set it to be some percentage of the average off campus monthly rent cost.

But these types of jobs don't lend themselves well to those types of things.\n\nPublic schools shouldn't be treating their students like a job market to exploit for cheap labor. There should be mandated minimums tied to cost of living. You can't have a labor market system when all the TA jobs are controlled by one owner. It's not like they can go work at another school they don't attend for a better wage.\n\nIt's a monopoly on \"work experience\" and recommendation letters that they are using to pay people a garbage wage.",

So, for example, if you chose the Intelligence (AI) thread, you\u2019ll have to take your generic CS prerequisites and various general Ed. classes but then you get to take a handful of classes specific to AI like Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, etc. they give you like 9 options and usually you\u2019re required to take like 3 of them. And you get to choose two of these threads. I believe Computer Engineering does this too. But yeah, so they\u2019re releasing (dropping) a new Cybersecurity thread, that\u2019ll basically allow you to take 3 of these classes pertaining to Cybersecurity. I\u2019m not sure if these classes are new, but yeah, that\u2019s basically what I mean. A few of these classes are like, \u201cMalware Reverse Engineering,\u201d and, \u201cCyberwarfare,\u201d which sound insanely interesting. I hope explanation makes sense.",

Coming on here for some advice and insights into off campus housing.\n\nI\u2019m a rising senior, and like hundreds of other students, I have been pushed off campus for the 24-25 school year. This leaves me exploring my off campus options. I\u2019m looking at apartments preferably near east side of campus, and something fairly affordable as well. I am a first generation student, and navigating this situation on my own has been kinda difficult\ud83d\ude05\n\nMy current options are Uhouse, 100 midtown, standard, and the here. I also would need a parking spot, so that must be taken into account. Based on my research, Uhouse is the most affordable option, but it apparently has majorly gone downhill in the past year or so based on other Reddit posts and google reviews. Is it really as bad as everyone says it is? Are my other options fairly decent? Just looking for insights from current or previous residents. Which option is the best for me? Also, are there any other options that I\u2019m not considering?\n\nThanks guys ",

Their office was so annoying and its practically impossible to contact someone when you need to, also their utilities are also so expensive. I remember paying like $80 one month when at uhouse the max i've paid is $11\n\nOut of all your options, here is probably the best if money is not a huge concern but if it is then uhouse isnt as bad as everyone makes it out to be (its just not as nice as the other apts)",

Is it mandatory to attend every events and parties, and what are the requirements to maintain your membership? What are advantages and disadvantages of joining? How are the houses, as in the building and facilities? Does each member get their own bedroom and a shared bathroom? Also, any thoughts on joining a sorority as an introvert?",

[https://www.gatechcpc.com/welcome](https://www.gatechcpc.com/welcome)\n\nSorority membership is not a social club that you register for a semester at a time. Once initiated you are expected to be a member for all your undergrad years. Greek organizations are regarded as membership for life; when you graduate you become an alum member.\n\nA sorority, or fraternity, is only as good as everyone participating and contributing. \n\nTo maintain your membership you need to stay current on your dues, participate in all required activities, and keep your grades up. Dues are billed each semester and you really can't opt out for a semester unless you aren't in school. Plus there is a meal plan and everyone takes their meals at the house and the meal plans are pretty good plus it's a great way to meet others and get comfortable as a new member. Participation is required for weekly meetings, philanthropic events, and most sisterhood events and socials unless you have a valid excuse.  Sorority membership is not really a drop in kind of thing, you need to be committed, but you will get far more out of it if you throw yourself into the opportunities.\n\nEach member does not live in the house, only about 1/3 - 1/2 the membership lives in plus exec officers are required. First years never live in the house. The rooms are a roommate situation, not singles, and there are common bathrooms for everyone on a floor.\n\nThe big advantage is friendship. You will not like everyone but most members find their group of close friends. That's what it's all about. Relationships in a Greek organization are really like a bell curve: you will love and be close with a small group, you will like and respect most of the other members to a certain degree, and there will be some that you really don't care for at all if not can't stand. But that's life. There will be members in your major and in your classes that you can study with, there will be members involved in clubs and orgs all over campus and can help you get involved too if you want. If you want leadership experience there are many offices you can run for, you will learn how to run a formal meeting efficiently (a great skill) and you will hopefully develop skills to get along with all kinds of personalities. You will also meet and make friends in other sororities and fraternities, as well as their friends who aren't in Greek life.\n\nIf you are an introvert you may find recruitment difficult. You need to hold up your end of a social conversation and show your best personality and appearance, and not just answer questions with short answers. Too many PNM's equate recruitment as an interview process but it's not at all, it's a process to find best fit. Each house has a slightly different vibe and a culture. Sororities are social organizations and social skills are important. After recruitment it is important to try to make friends in your new member class. Meetings and meals help with this, plus you can hang out at the house when you aren't in class. You don't have to be a gregarious person necessarily, but you might need to get out of your comfort zone at first and then it gets easier.",

The 8 NPC sororities actually really are far more alike than different, with around 175-200 members in each one. \n\nWhat anyone thinks of each group's vibe or culture or characteristics is completely dependent on their own personal lens, the individuals they happen to interact with, and the influence from other's personal opinions.  \n\nRecruitment is in person for a reason. The only way to get a feel for the different sororities is through meeting and talking to members.  This is why fall formal recruitment is the best time to consider joining because you get to meet some members in all houses at least once.\n\nYou also need to keep in mind that recruitment is a two-way process; the sororities will be making their own determination about the PMN's 'vibes' as well, and while you may decide you think you like the vibe of certain sororities best, those chapters may think that other PNM's are a better fit for them. In that case they would release you and you would need to focus on your other options. \n\nTLDR; you can't go through recruitment before you go through recruitment. Keep an open mind and don't think you can predetermine a certain house for yourself.",

Yes there are required things you go to each semester, but if you have serious conflicts (classes, jobs, etc.) most will try to work with you. Like you would expect anywhere, you'll be really close to a subset and maybe not know others as well. But the support I have felt from those I didn't realize knew my name has been incredible. From day 1 I had people offering to help me study, plan schedules for classes, and a group who would consistently bring me dinner across campus when I had evening classes just to make sure I would eat something. Greek life may not be a great fit for everyone, but if you're curious, take a look at the CPC guide, watch some of the GT sorority sisterhood videos on youtube, and rush. You can always back out of rush, COB at a later date, or join a chapter and then drop before initiation if it's not a right fit for you.",

I asked the Balfour rep, and he said that the alumni association does the negotiating and they no longer carry it. Can anyone from the alumni association clarify? The ring with the stone is hideous and the seal is timeless, and apparently I wasn't the only one who asked today. If I'm going to spend the money on a class ring (which at this point I'm not) I'd like to be able to buy the one I actually want to wear.",

        "selftext": "Just wanted to say that this isn't a plant based alternative. Neither are Slutty Vegan's 20 dollar burgers. It still baffles me that people think that having one plant based protein option for double the price of meat is considered an adequate option for vegans/vegetarians. Like seriously, you can't tell me tofu costs more than beef, I know how much they cost. Maybe these fake meat options should be replaced with protein like tofu or beans that aren't as expensive or something? Because just having vegetables as the only affordable option is ridiculous. I know this is a bigger issue than just at GT because of demand, but I just needed to rant somewhere because it's actually getting super frustrating. Also curious to hear other vegetarian/vegan's experiences here.",

Yes, there is a bit of a learning curve and time commitment but after the first month its a lot better. As far as on campus options go, twisted does a fairly good job so maybe check them out.",

In terms of my experiences,\n\n1. Cooking so so valuable. You save money and you can start simple. If you have a pan, you can always make a run to Publix to get a lotta veggies (different colors), pasta, sauce and whip up your \"mostly homemade pasta\"\n\n2. In terms of protein, tofu has been a valuable asset. I personally am into making curries. An easy way could be to get some veggies, tofu, and thai curry paste (yellow, red, etc) and whip up a beautiful thai curry in minutes. You can enjoy with rice! Also, my roommate and I also like to make quesadillas with refried black beans, veggies, taco seasoning, taco sauce, some chilli powders, cheese and its also not as difficult if you put your mind to it\n\nThe point is that sometimes we gotta get a bit creative and realize that there are options if you actively try them out!\n\n3. In terms of food options if you dont have time to cook or unable to, below are a list of places that could work (according to my experience + vegetarian friends' experiences). Not exahustive by any means:\n\n* Chipotle\n* Rreal tacos\n* Lucky Buddha\n* Govindas Cafe (they deliver to campus if you join their whatsapp group. very affordable)\n* Food terminal\n* Mamouns Falafel\n* Gyro Bros\n* Sometimes there's this place called Marrakech Express that comes to campus to serve lunch. Price point and food really good\n*",

I do appreciate the school trying to improve our options but please \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f keep our wallets in mind (also Slutty Vegan as a company just sucks, discussion for another day). I know it's hard for the school to bring back chains like subway, Panera, taco bell, etc., but I think campus food would be a lot better if they provided vegetarian options like those rather than expensive alternatives.",

Tech Square, food trucks, and community market stuff) at a given time, but **everybody ignores everything** not named Panda, CFA, or Twisted Taco. \n\nIf you want Subway, did you *at least* try 5th Street Deli or Whistle Bistro? Both had a format similar to Subway but they were changed last year because nobody ate there. Even now, they have Jimmy Johns. Does JJ not have vegan options? \n\nIn Oct 2022, Test Kitchen had a [plant based menu](https://imgur.com/a/5ySHBoy). They even went out of their way to feature people from Veggie Jackets on their IG to talk about it and those highlights are still visible. Nobody ate there and they never brought the special menu back. \n\nThey've had at least 4 vegan food trucks on campus at one point or another, but nobody ate at those except Slutty Vegan so the others stopped coming. It's disheartening for food truck owners to see the never ending line for Slutty Vegan while it takes an act of congress for students to look in your direction. \n\nSee the running theme? Actions speak louder than words and when people don't patronize XYZ, they're going to change the format to whatever people will patronize. \n\nThe Slutty Vegan situation is complicated so I'll leave it at this: their food truck was the MOST successful food truck to set foot on campus. Now that they're here permanently, everybody hates them. I don't get it.",

JJ is similar to others as they have no protein, it's still just vegetables. I like Subway because they have those patties and places like Panera have eggs, taco bell has beans, etc (for an affordable price too).\n\nAnd I totally get your point with Slutty Vegan. Maybe it's their good marketing (like wow there's a burger named sloppy toppy? That's crazy, I gotta check that out!) But now since we have it here permanently, I think it's easier to see that each burger is 20 dollars which trumps their brand. Honestly, I'm not sure how well Slutty Vegan is doing, I'm assuming not well because it burns through everyone's wallets, but I could be wrong. I'd be curious to know though.",

Come up with a data structure and practice adding an element to it, removing an element, etc. Then check your work with CS Vistool. \n\nThe Big O questions were the hardest in my opinion, since they were the trickiest. Here the main tip I have is to write out the worst case time complexities for all operations of all data structures (e.g. adding to external chaining hashmap) and study that.",

However, getting only negative feedback with zero positive reinforcement isn\u2019t exactly balanced constructive criticism, and I\u2019d hope it\u2019s not the norm in the real world.\n\nFor example, we were meeting with a faculty member seeking advice on the valuation section of our report asking whether we should explain a high-level framework or be more granular and try to execute the valuation and produce numbers. She said that without fail, the examiners will be disappointed either way. You\u2019re damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be a baby, but I hope it\u2019s understandable that it\u2019s not super validating to do a project given unclear expectations and being told that no matter how hard you\u2019ll try, you\u2019ll always be a disappointment. It honestly makes me want to put in less effort since we\u2019ll be a disappointment either way. \n\nI\u2019d love to hear if alumni look back on Senior Design thinking it\u2019s more or less intense than the real world and if they felt they\u2019d actually learned applicable skills in this class ",

They want to be as harsh, but they're not as connected with the project and they don't have the time to add nuance and positive feedback. I was lucky because my team's advisor did a good job of meeting with us after the interim and translating the pure criticism into something constructive (if still harsh, we were objectively behind at that point).\n\nBecause of that, I personally had a great experience, but if you don't have a faculty member on your side like that, I'd say just keep you head down, take your passing grade, and get out.\n\ntldr:\n\nGood advisor: ignore the haters and have fun doing a cool project\n\nBad advisor: just get out",

Teams feel like the feedback is \"rating their performance\" while the faculty are just trying to give clear, candid feedback based on their experience in industry.\n\nIt can feel harsh, even brutal, but we would be doing a disservice to any students by not giving them clear feedback.\n\nGetting feedback that hurts to hear doesn't mean you aren't doing a great job!

He didn't tell us how it was wrong or what could be fixed. We confirmed with our Accounting notes and the CFO of the client's company, and the formula was correct. I've also heard stories of ISYE faculty getting so angry that they storm out of the room during a presentation.

Great talent will only want to come to GT if they have a competitive program and a pro-style offense (with rare exceptions, GT has a tough time getting offensive skill positions into the league and it's usually just trenches guys).\n\nPaul Johnson did the best with what he had but we will continue to struggle as long as our Athletics department refuses to gets real and smart about their strategy to challenge UGA meaningfully.\n\nWe are a harder school than UGA - that is both a positive and negative. You can go farther in life with a degree from GT (on average) than a degree from UGA. So that should be an advantage when recruiting talent. BUT GT is hard and if a top talent is focused on playing college football and then going pro, then they don't (and probably shouldn't) focus on too much else other than football. Why would they put themselves through the stress of weed-out engineering classes when they could be racing cars after strip club visits in Athens?\n\nIdeally we would want to recruit athletes that are up for the challenge academically but also talented on the field. That unique subgroup of athletes typically make the best pro players anyway (professionalism, game IQ etc.). Stanford and Michigan are both academically challenging schools but are able to recruit well because they have a firm strategy on *who* to recruit.\n\nGT sells itself in terms of the quality of the degree, location, program history etc. It's in a big conference as well. The problem is our team doesn't have the vision or the belief that it can create a culture of high performing athletes that won't just get destroyed by UGA. It would take a big personality that comes from a culture of winning and understands the nuance and history of GT Football, that could create pull and get us up to the floor of talent necessary to challenge for a ranked spot consistently. One good hire can be the difference maker. I doubt we will see that though. The athletics department is too narrow-minded/focused on short term appointments, when, in reality, no one ever truly believes that we will win a CFB championship from year to year when in reality it should be totally possible.",

When I was learning data science, I did attend an online presentation and they went over the job titles for different roles (analyst, data scientist, data engineer, ML researcher, etc.) but it was still hard to understand the distinctions until I read lots of job postings, and I sent out multiple resumes for jobs with different titles that were not really matches (HR could probably tell right away).

The EthicsPoint site I submitted the report to said that the information would be \"confidential\" (source: Ethicspoint Navex terms and conditions). This seems to be directly violated by A, B given that I cannot withdraw according to the HR employee I spoke to, and no where in their terms and conditions or their website was this clearly indicated.\n\nA and B combined means that sensitive personal details of my complaint will be unmasked to the person I am complaining against, which includes information about people who can corroborate my story, who I would prefer not be known to the complainee due to retaliation potential.  There is also personal information that I would prefer not be made public (although if it is, the world doesn't end for me).\n\nI have already considered seeking legal advice, and may pursue it if there are no further options at the university. I aware of the 50-18-72 carveout of the Georgia Open Records act.  I do not believe i was informed about the Open Records Act prior to filing a report that was called \"confidential\", nor was I informed that I would have no way to stop the process and no way to prevent the complainee to be informed even if I wanted to back out of the process.\n\nI was wondering if there was any advice besides for seeking legal representation, to prevent the publication of highly sensitive personal information about witnesses and more.   I am looking into legal representation, and look forward to a chance to exercise my rights.\n\nPS: I am happy speaking to anyone of the details of the case, including my name and information about the case (and the complainee), in private message."

I attended a small liberal arts university for my undergrad and I really enjoyed the collaborative environment there, and I'm worried about going to a school that's a lot bigger and that has a reputation like Tech does. I don't back down from academic challenge (because I'm pursuing a PhD!) but I also don't want to feel like I'm doing it alone.\n2. I have heard the qualifying exam pass rate is 50% and that it is brutal even compared to quals at other top AE programs. Is this accurate?\n3. How is the housing situation for grad students?

GT has always been my dream school and I thought this would be the place I\u2019d finally settle down, but since coming here, it\u2019s been really hard to find my place. I met a few people in my FASET group, but we\u2019re all different majors and some of them commute so we\u2019re not super close. I tried informal rush but got dropped by every sorority. However, I\u2019m mostly concerned about the competitive culture. I knew it would difficult, but I\u2019d heard my classes would be more collaborative than I\u2019ve experienced them to be. I\u2019ve found it very hard to do group work or ask for help in my classes. I\u2019ll reach out to my group with questions about lecture or hw and they will either not respond or say they didn\u2019t see my message until after the hw/exam passes. I\u2019m fine with going to OH, but I feel some questions don\u2019t need to be directly answered by the professor when a simple text can suffice. At my old school my friends and I would study together and help each other as much as possible. I just thought that was the norm. I get the vibe that students here think helping others is in some way disadvantaging them. So I ask\u2026does it get better? Is this just typical of intro courses and people will warm up over time? I\u2019m seriously contemplating switching schools again. I\u2019m tired and just want to be settled in somewhere. App deadlines are coming up and I need to figure out what to do. What are y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!"

However, when there are cameras every five feet and GTPD can be anywhere on campus within 3 minutes, why isn't every student building accessible with a regular old buzzcard?\n\nGod forbid I want to study somewhere closer to my apartment than the CULC, especially when the buses aren't running either!! Why are we heating these buildings when 90% of them are inaccessible and empty 2 out of the 7 days of the week (28% of the time, for you math whizzes). \n\nI guess I'll stick to the tried and true strategy of waiting for a professor or grad student to come meandering out just to study in a quieter building closer to me that I'm footing the electric bill for. Ugh, rant over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

It was mostly chill, one of us used to play the guitar or ukulele and the rest of us would just sing.\n\nLately, I\u2019ve been missing doing this and was wondering if anyone would like to meet up and you know, do something like this? \nOr are there any existing non-professional, chill out jamming groups at GT that I can be occasionally part of, mostly with the objective of having a fun time and making friends in the process."
