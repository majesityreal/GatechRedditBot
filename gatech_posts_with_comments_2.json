However, be mindful that some online classes have in-person exams, albeit very rarely (you can email the prof in advance to registration to make sure it's not the case).\n\nIdk what the difference is for certain, but I'd guess that video is async classes? If that is the case, there are n lecture times and you watch pre-recorded ones and basically it's no different from a Udemy course with a lot of homework. But again, this is my assumption, I've never seen async referred to as video classes. A way to test it if the meeting times are NA.",

One of my worse grades at GT. If you're Intel thread, don't be like me; attend lecture and you'll be fine.\u00a0\n\n\nCS 2050 - ironically enough one of my favorite classes at GT CS classes. Ronnie Howard is goated. Definitely a lot of work but if you camp office hours and take advantage of TAs, getting an A probably won't be too hard.\n\n\nCS 2340 - this class is a joke but an easy A. They improved it this semester but I wish they'd just throw it out entirely and replace it with a 2000 level web or mobile dev class where we're taught development as a focus and object-oriented design/analysis as an aside (semester project has been a JAVAFX app, Android app, and I think now website?) Seems to just test on memorization.\n\n\nCS 2110- another favorite of mine. Learned about circuits, gates, Assembly (not a useful type), C, etc. There's some overlap with 2050 in terms of truth tables, De Morgan's, and what not. I don't think it was particularly hard but I know some people struggle with the class. Think it's way easier compared to implementing and understanding a bunch of algos in AI though.",

I'm planning on majoring in mechanical engineering.\n\nFor Vanderbilt, I have received a scholarship that covers my tuition. I also got the Davis scholarship at Columbia which would cover about 50k. I haven't received my financial aid package from Georgia Tech or Duke. I have toured Columbia and Georgia Tech and loved both campuses. I plan on visiting Vanderbilt and Duke in next few weeks. I am currently leaning towards Georgia Tech(#5) and Columbia(#17) because they're the better engineering schools according to US News Rankings. I am still open towards Duke and Vanderbilt. Duke (#22) it is well known and has a strong engineering program. Vanderbilt(#42) isn't as good for engineering but it has a good reputation. Is Georgia Tech's engineering education significantly better because of the ranking difference or are top 20 schools about the same? I also wish to know their rankings for mechanical engineering.\n\nI feel like Georgia Tech will prepare me better for engineering but Columbia will have more career opportunities because it's an Ivy and it's in New York. I like Atlanta more than New York but I'm fine with living in New York. I would prefer to have a STEM heavy course load which Georgia Tech has. Columbia would be less STEM heavy because of the \"Core Curriculum\". My main concern is which school will help me get the best/most engineering job offers. The community and environment is another important factor for me. What other factors should I consider?\n\nI appreciate any advice! Thanks!",

But, the reality has to be spoken, I got rejected from Gatech, but from numerous conversations that I have had with Gatech students , I have come to understand that there is a very good chance of getting funding once you are on campus. So if you are worried about the tuition and fees there is a realistic chance of getting funding.\n\nHowever, as I said before, I know where you're coming from as I myself am trying elentlessely to find an advisor for funding. One piece of information is that professors keep getting projects round the year. The professor you're trying to work with may not have a project right now but may get a project later(maybe in may, jun(maybe). The idea or the strategy is to be persistent! Keep trying, be courteous when asking for an opportunity. I have met some people who managed to get funding before going to the campus, so just hang in there tight!",

If I transfer to GT, I would be paying \\~3K more a year, but I would be able to take more in-depth classes for a biomaterials concentration, and Atlanta is a better location than Charlottesville for job opportunities and internships. MSE is also relatively small at GT, so I'm assuming that it won't be impossible to get research opportunities. Would it be worth it to transfer?",

Is it viable to use UW as a pipeline to jobs in silicon valley as an intl (non-US)? Does working/studying non-stop with basically nothing except winter break kill your uni experience?

They've done some things that violate the rules at Tech, and I'm just trying to get it all sorted out. I've tried going to my advisor and explaining the situation and they were just like, damn that sucks, that sounds like a you thing to figure out. Who could I talk to that would genuinely care or do something about it?",

Email not only the head of whatever department, but cc all the chairs of the department + any provost's u think would cover it. If it's something traumatizing, u can ask gt CARE for next steps but they are connected to STAMPS + dean of students. I will say my attempt was frivolous 2/3 of the times i complained\n\nhonestly, just be prepared for the most frustrating bullshit responses from ur teacher and from whoever replies (if they even do). Also know that if a mircale occurs and they escalate, u most likely wont be anonymous",

After you pass Piedmont Ave you'll get a crossing to a two-way protected bike lane that will bring you alongside Piedmont Park until you hit the beltline.\n\nIf you bike on the road, just take the whole lane. The traffic isn't too fast in that section ^ because of all the lights\n\nIf you don't want to get on the road, it's technically illegal but it's sometimes safer to get on the sidewalk and go super slow, which I recommend if you're taking the 10th St route crossing the I-85 on-ramp going from campus to midtown. Public safety bikes will also ride on sidewalks so imo it's not a huge deal as long as you yield to pedestrians",

Because the threat and horror of only providing accommodations for 90% of people. Better 0% than 90%, okay. Cuz the only thing that will make you happy is zero bus service for everyone (equality/inclusion) or personalized mobility devices for everyone (also equity/inclusion).

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm currently facing a challenging situation and I'm reaching out for advice from anyone who has been through something similar or knows the steps I should take.\n\nI was recently informed by Georgia Tech's registrar's office that my Bachelor of Science degree from ETH Zurich doesn't meet their admission criteria for further study (after being admitted into graduate school ~3 month ago). They've stated that I need a \"4-year license or diploma\" from a Swiss institution. However, the Bachelor's degree program at ETH Zurich that I'm enrolled in spans only 3 years, adhering to the Bologna Process standardization. \n\nThis situation is particularly perplexing to me since I had assumed that a bachelor\u2019s degree from ETH Zurich would be sufficient for admission, especially considering that GT accepts 3-year Bachelor's degrees from Germany, which follows the same Bologna Process and that ETH's Bachelor degree is an internationally recognised BSc from a top tier university.\n\nAdding to the confusion, the \"license\" they refer to is typically awarded by vocational schools, and the \"diploma\" is a relic from before the Swiss education system adopted the Bologna system in 1999. ETH Zurich no longer awards these \"diplomas,\" and the standardized bachelor's degree program now is 3 years, not 4.\n\nHas anyone else encountered such an issue with the recognition (or lack thereof) of international degrees by US institutions? I could really use some advice on how to navigate this situation or suggestions on whom to contact within the academic administration to address my case.\n\nAny insights or guidance would be hugely appreciated!\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "Hey. I am highly considering GaTech's co-op but was wondering if the fact that you are only allowed to work for one company actually be counter-productive since it seems to be risky and very hit or miss and I'm looking to gather as much experience as possible. Is it possible to work a fourth co-op term at a different company after completing the minimum 3 and are there any work arounds for switching co-op jobs if better offers are received. I really like the advantage of being able to work at different times of the year in co-op rather than only being limited to the summer and graduating in 5 years in not an issue for me. Additionally, I would like to know if getting internships and co-ops are hard to get in CS as an intl at Tech as well as if you can/should look for your own jobs outside of what is available on CareerBuzz ( haven't enrolled at Tech yet so unsure exactly of how it works). Lastly, can I expect the pay to be around $16 on the lower end for cs/swe jobs? Thanks so much in advance if you read this and feel free to pm me if you have any advice!",

Internships occur year-round. PLENTY of internships in the fall and spring.\n\n&gt;internships and co-ops are hard to get in CS as an intl at Tech\n\nThere are a couple more [hoops](https://isss.oie.gatech.edu/isss/hiring-international-students-scholars-or-student-interns) to jump though, but international students are hired all the time.\n\n&gt;can I expect the pay to be around $16 on the lower end for cs/swe jobs\n\nDepends on where in the country you go. Within Atlanta, you can expect at least $20/hr as a SWE intern. In west coast tech hubs, it'll be much more, depending on company. I know interns that make the annual equivalent of $120k which is $60/hr.",

At that time, I was in a fairly comfortable position; working for two years as a software engineer since 2021, and both my parents were earning.\n\nMy mother unfortunately got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in May 2023, around the time I was preparing for my visa process. My father had to resign from his job to care for her, and I deferred my admission to Fall 2024 and continued working in India to be her secondary care giver. She ultimately passed away a few weeks ago.\n\nWe incurred tremendous medical expenses over the last year &amp; insurance barely covered anything. While I have some savings from my own, I cannot rely on my father for funding as he isn't earning right now. Getting a loan is also very hard right now due to lack of any earning co-signer, which is needed by most Indian banks.\n\nAs of now, I'm super confused regarding my MS plans. Gatech is my dream school and i was thrilled to have received an admit from a very competitive pool of candidates.\n\nWhile I understand that there are no outright scholarships for international students at Gatech, I'm wondering if it's possible to secure a GTA/GRA or any other paid work to support my degree. I am aware that we are not supposed to mail professors with unofficial emails (we won't get those before August), is there any way we can reach out right now ? Alternatively, would an online MS be a better option?",

If not, cold email them, or even better their phd students for better chances of getting a response.",

I eventually made it to the North Avenue exit ramp but was then stuck there for an hour. I had a tiny car, so I managed to hop the sidewalk adjacent to Smith dormitory, and drive backwards down the sidewalk. \n\nI had a wall on one side between me and the dorms, and power poles and a mailbox between me and the North Avenue/Williams Street ramp. So it took a hot minute but I backed down the sidewalk until I got to the Brittain service entrance, turned around, and then drove down Williams Street and onto campus. Once people saw what I had done, others followed behind. \n\nAnd that is how I liberated the North Avenue interstate ramp during Freaknik '94.",

Not to mention that I don't see myself going for any sort of administrative position.\n\nAre all engineers required to get a PE license, or is this actually a less traveled path than I think? For anyone who chose not to do it, how did that affect your career? And is there any advantage in working in more design based fields with a PE license?",

Also for some states you have to have a PE on staff to offer engineering services in that state. Some even break out SE and all other. Now, you could just hire out the stamping part.They're many companies out there that you can pay for their stamp, some shady. Again, I would tell anyone in the big 2 (CE and ME) to take their FE just cause it is easier right out of school. You got 4 years to decide on doing it.",

This study is directed at college students (undergrad or grad) who are between the ages of 21 &amp; 30 (you do not necessarily need to attend GT). If you meet these criteria, please consider filling out a 5 minute survey at this link - [https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_3aDVErC4x3lHNMq](https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3aDVErC4x3lHNMq). \n\nThere is no compensation other than my gratitude lol, but happy to fill out surveys or do a similar request if you DM me re: that. Thanks!",

Regardless, it will be the same pay as a monthly GRA or GTA in the end; HR does that calculation. \n\nFor masters, I am not sure. Becky Wilson should be able to help you figure out the hourly pay but GTA as masters get paid around 1.2-1.3k per month, so I assume the total amount for 80 hours will be like that. But will you really do 20 hrs per week though? Remember you still have to CLOCK in hours if you are a GA and if you are a GTA, you don't need to clock in and you still get paid a monthly stipend.",

In my experience, very few people are super committed to the LLC project/theme (just the way life goes, not the fault of students or profs, but its a theme across majors/years/communities). That said, GC has a huge proportion of OOS/intl compared to the general population (can't speak to other LLCs). Choose whichever fits you best, getting close to profs is cool but its not a gigantic deal. Grand Challenges professors are always available so I wouldn't worry to much about that. Personally I thought the entrepreneurship aspect was cool; I haven't been super passionate about GC itself but the people I've met through it are truly phenomenal and the community itself outside of class is stellar.",

With that being said, there are plenty of other ways to show this, and it is a very minor part of my overall resume. When I first started college, I didn't have as much stuff from GT on my resume, and I think it was mildly helpful for getting the internship after my freshman year. I do want to reiterate that I do not think it will make a big difference though, and the most important part is finding a strong sense of community, (which you can find through plenty of other ways such as clubs, housing, or classes on campus).",

        "selftext": "  \nHey Yellow Jackets! Bits of Good is pleased to announce that with the Fall 2024 and Summer 2024 schedules being released, GT Scheduler is up and ready to help you prepare your schedules with the **new Compare Schedules feature**!\n\nWhile GT Scheduler was originally made so students could optimize the creation of their *own* class schedules, the Compare Schedules feature will now allow users to look at their friends\u2019 schedules from within the GT Scheduler site! Once logged in with a schedule already made, click the \u201cShare Schedule\u201d button located on the right and share your schedule(s) with others by entering their email or copying the link. Email invites will appear in their inbox once sent. On the right panel, turn on the \u201cCompare Schedule\u201d switch and click on your friend\u2019s schedules to compare! Note that this feature **does not work on mobile**.\n\nGT Scheduler has also opened a **donation portal**! In light of growing engineering costs, we are asking for the help of our users to keep GT Scheduler running! These donations will enable us to continue refining our services and providing students with these tools and new features. Every contribution, no matter the size, makes a **significant** difference in our ability to maintain and improve GT Scheduler. We at Bits of Good want to thank the GT community for using and supporting our work, and we can\u2019t wait to see how the future of this amazing website unfolds. Happy scheduling!  \n[https://www.gt-scheduler.org/](https://www.gt-scheduler.org/)  \n[https://donorbox.org/gt-scheduler](https://donorbox.org/gt-scheduler)",

(They have done this multiple times, not just this semester)\n\nNot only this, but what is effectively a youtube video and some scribbles of notes every week are mind-numbingly simple for a class that is supposed to be advanced and extremely important to the field of study. \n\nFor the hard part, the simple and logical solution is to go talk to the dean about this. But that is not a good idea as this lecturer is\u2026 close to the dean.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, half of the people in the class are happy about the free A, but I went into this class excited to learn about the subject I want to dedicate my career to. I feel like I\u2019m falling behind everybody else in the field, as the shit we do in this class is just basic circuit analysis that any first semester freshman in ECE can do in their sleep.\n\nIt already doesn\u2019t help that I was promised, and paid massive amounts of money, to take an in person class because I struggle to pay attention in an online format, but even if I do pay attention all I see is RC circuits and plug-and-chug equations.\n\nThis \u201cworld class\u201d engineering program can sometimes be an absolute joke, and it\u2019s obvious that some lectures should not be employed here.\n",

On day 1, the prof said that 3043 was your chance to learn circuits again and that's exactly what I did and passed an interview with TI a few weeks later.~~ The class, however, is not very advanced. Many who go deeper into the field view it more as a hurdle to get to the real classes. There are better professors that are teaching the advanced classes in the field. The people I know who are pursuing it as a career will say that interning experience is what actually that propelled them to be successful.

                "body": "4th paragraph LOL... Yes, i don't think ECE dean can address this concern. It is the definition of conflict of interest.\n\nI always read reddit but never commented until I saw this. I really feel you. I took her class during covid. Never opened her camera once. The classes comprised of her reading her lecture notes WORD FOR WORD. And she posted these lecture notes on canvas later. Exams are exactly similar to her examples on these notes. All of the classes she teach are either like this OR magically they're taught by this other professor she is related to (not hard to guess for ECEs). So, you end up learning nothing and getting a free A. During my entire 5 years at ECE, I never seen her in real life. She is just a robotic voice for me.\n\nThe problem is she always gets the best reviews on every platform (ratemyprof, CIOS, you name it) because people like 1 - their free As  2 - she is very nice to the point that there is zero rigor in the class. Again, she is a nice person, but a horrible college professor in my opinion. So if you look at metrics, GT sees no problem. To your comment of \" and it\u2019s obvious that some lectures should not be employed here,\" it's common for husband and wive duos to be hired by the same university. So maybe it was a BOGO deal in a way (again, just my theory, i obviously don't have any proof)\n\nIf there is any ECE freshmand/sophmore who is reading this - Please avoid her for anything (circuit analysis, VLSI, etc.) at all costs. Unless you have this silly challenge to try to keep your 4.0 from becoming 3.999 (nobody cares - you'll get a job if you're a good engineer not because you got an A in every course you had), you'll absolutely learn zero thing in her classes. There are 10 minute youtube videos that will educate you more than her entire semester of circuit analysis course.\n\nThere are great professors in ECE that will inspire you and remind you why you actually chose engineering in the first place. They're very rare. However, it is rewarding to find the courses that they teach. Please go find them.",

You should probably do a little bit of review of some basic calculations like determinants, row reductions, and how to find a basis for Null Space, Column Space, and Row space. \n\nI've seen that most people struggle with 1554 because of the time required inside and outside of class, and also the exams sometimes being tough.\n\nFor 3406, Loss uses Gilbert Strang's book, \"Introduction to Linear Algebra.\" (He uses 6th edition but you can find the 4th and 5th editions online for free -- The content is mostly the same). The best thing about the book is that it has an entire lecture video series on YouTube by MIT Open Courseware. The lecture series playlist is called \"MIT 18.06SC Linear Algebra, Fall 2011.\"\n\nLoss is an amazing professor and breaks down the content with helpful visualizations. I strongly recommend taking 3406 with him. Homework assignments were given every 1 or 2 weeks and were not time-consuming. His exams were quite similar to the practice exams, and were fair if you went to lecture and did the homework.",

I went through this last year so I know how it goes\n\nFirst off, if you\u2019re graduating undergrad this semester, know that you can\u2019t register for grad classes until Phase II registration, since you\u2019re a \u201cnew\u201d student again. That means that you\u2019ll have plenty of time to figure out what\u2019s available and what\u2019s filled up. \n\nSecond, if you\u2019re registering as an undergrad, you\u2019ll need level permits to actually be able to register for grad classes. I believe that also opens during Phase II, so you can try to request overrides in advance but they may tell you to wait\n\nLastly, your actual question. I didn\u2019t really struggle getting into any major area classes except for one, but it opened up within the first week of class. Just like undergrad, people will drop classes within the first week of registration and you\u2019ve got a decent chance of getting in. As an undergrad I went for ME 6104 during my last semester and got in just fine\n\nBy the way, not sure how you\u2019re planning your grad school credit hours, but 9 credits in a semester is enough to fill up your time. I did 12 last semester and it took over time from my extra curriculars, so spread it out as much as you can",

In honors you get to have an apartment as a freshman (i.e. your own bedroom). To me, that makes honors the one that\u2019s most worth it. After you become a second year+, you can apply to be in the 3rd floor of Nelson Shell with priority but i think there was even a waitlist for that this year (on campus housing is becoming very competitive at GT). But you can get an on-campus apartment (in principle) without being in an LLC, I guess it gives you a higher chance tho.",

I did Global Leadership my first year and some people found their core friend group from it, and planned and participated in all our community events. If you're worried about meeting others / finding a community LLCs can be nice for that. Matheson and Perry are pretty mid freshman dorms, but they are close to classes on East. Biggest advice for living in the standard dorms: communicate with your roommate and decide boundaries/rules for everything from the start.\n\nMy pros: \n- GL has two really nice lounges for GL only with outdoor, board, and card games\n- free (tho coming from your $800) coffee and snacks in the lounge \n- we had guests visit our lounge for dinner talks from various areas which were good networking opportunities\n- fun outings to get you involved in campus and ATL life (escape room, ropes course, ATL bike tour, Hawks and Atlanta United games, food packing volunteering, looks like the most recent cohort toured NGO Care's office). \n- The involvement and the 1st semester project are things to put on your resume (mine was very blank when I started college). You'll propose a solution to an UN Sustainable Development Goal and write a mock grant application for it. \n\n\nCon: it costs $800 \n\n(in my mind I chose to leave my car at home for 1st year and put that $800 annual parking fee to the GL fee instead). YES it costs you $800 for the school year, but that money comes back to you in the form of planned events (so if you don't attend, them, you kinda are wasting your money).",

They finally came and started their inspections shortly after your post and after many of the certs had expired. It took them a few weeks to complete the initial inspections across campus, and they now need to return to complete follow-up inspections (for example, elevators that were out of order during the initial visit).",

        "selftext": " Hello everyone. I am super relieved to conclude my applications with my top 2 MS ECE admits - UT Austin (Integrated Circuits and Systems Track) and Georgia Tech. I hope you can help me make an informed decision.   \nPost Masters, I plan to join the industry rather than research. And I am slightly inclined towards Physical Design. \n\n* Georgia Tech - Amazing Brand, so great respect for jobs. Great in Physical Design (both Analog and Digital) and Comp. Microarchitecture. I heard an amazing professor who is a legend in Tapeout joined recently.\n* UT Austin - Very affordable tuition fees, access to Teaching Assistantships. Austin is the hub of most semiconductor companies. Good in Digital Physical Design and has access to a large variety of courses.\n\nWhich will be a better school for transitioning to the industry?",

I'm currently taking Chemistry at a community college near my university to fulfill that requirement for computer engineering in fact. \n\nPhysics 1 will count as your lab science elective. \n\nSo because they don't care about +s and -s, only A, B, C, it is a bit hard to get that 3.3 right. To be safe, you'll want at least 2 As and 2 Bs for a solid math/science GPA of 3.5. If you just take Calc 1, 2, and physics then you'll need just 1 A and 2 Bs, it's not too difficult to calculate. \n\nI had a perfect gpa last semester, taking writing, anthropology, calc 2, and two CompSci classes. This semester I have a B in CompSci, and close As in writing 2, calc 3, physics 1, and chemistry.\n\nSo because I got an A in calc 2 last semester, I need at least an A and 2 Bs in calc 3, physics, and chem.\n\nThis is actually making me nervous as well, because they are quite close As and I'm considering dropping Calc 3 because of this so I can get a B in physics and a B in chem and be fine no risks.\n\nAll this to say, the stress never stops lol\n\nBut I think you'll be fine as a math major, dedicate all your time to calc 1 and 2 and physics. Other classes should be less priority but don't let any easy As become Bs. \n\n  \nDid that all make sense or do you need some clarification? I just kind of ranted on and on my fault",

You're going into it better than I was if that makes you feel better, I thought I was screwed at first because I thought college classes we're for the whole year like they are in high school and thought ut was over for me because I wasn't taking chem haha. Also for chem I recommend an online class, you'll have to come in for labs but the rest of the class you can use chat gpt (use the paid version it's far more accurate for chemistry).",

This parking lot is planned to be replaced with several academic infill buildings (which even have renders) and there are plans to extend state street down to tech parkway through where the Ferst center currently stands as a bus-only cut-through of the campus core (don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re planning on rebuilding it in the new arts district).

I'm also a little concerned with enrollment projection, since tech is already increasing enrollment too fast. I hope they can slow down the rate that the enrollment is increasing and do more improvements on the facilities first.",

Biggest question for me is access to the buildings for equipment moving, as I noted in another comment the lathes and water jet and other things in the Invention Studio and Machining Mall were delivered on large trucks and required heavy equipment to move them. There will be tradeoffs with any plans but looks like GT has been looking at building in this area already so they've probably thought about it pretty thoroughly. More housing and classroom space is needed with enrollment increasing.",

And, if you look back historically to changes that have happened on the campus over the decades, it is clearly trending in a clear direction (like, Tech Green used to be a parking lot. Can you imagine going back to that). So, the leadership of the institute have a clear intent to make more efficient use of space on the campus and want to axe surface lots where possible. \n\nI would say to not be sad about this, but take the bright side and view it as possible room for growth. These lots is as a readily available space to expand when the needs and resources available arise, and the history shows that GT\u2019s leadership is more than open to replacing surface parking lots with new development. As GT continues to grow they can utilize that area to build more of whatever is most pressing (labs, dorms, classrooms, etc).",

I'd be very curious as to the number of parking spots the GT had back in those days vs presently. Tbh I wouldn't be surprised if there are more parking spots now then there were back then. \n\nIn addition we are continuing to grow the number of students and the facilities available on campus.

Go on Historic Aerials or use Google Earth and you'll see a surprising number of large lots that are no longer there across campus.\n\n&gt; Flat lots are just... Not space efficient or good uses of land... From like $/sq ft usage. Sorry if you feel otherwise.\n\nI am not claiming they're space-efficient, and \"good\" is a value judgement.  Overall, I think parking lots are way-overbuilt and have unacceptably low average usage rates across the country and especially metro Atlanta, but *not* at GT.  I am simply against the \"fewer/no cars\" mindset when no pragmatic tradeoffs are offered.  As I said, those folks will never be satisfied by any level of reduction until it's utterly complete.",

This is a living document that's been around since like the 1910s. \n\nIn 2002 the Campus Master Plan states there were 9744 parking spaces. In 2023 the Campus Master Plan states there were 13256 parking spaces. I'm unable to locate the 1997, 1991 or earlier CMPs online tho they are available through GTs archives. \n\n&gt;No pragmatic tradeoffs\n\nThese documents have literally pages dedicated to talking about the strategic plans for parking and why certain decisions are desired. For example - the reduction of surface lots is largely tied to the simple fact that Fulton county (like many cities) have established taxes/fees associated with the amount of sq ft. of impermeable land (including parking lots) that is owned by an organization. This fee is driven by the fact that we use a combined storm water/sanitary sewer system and it is simply becoming overwhelmed. To fix this we needed to raise funds to build a better system/work to reduce the amount of water run off. Hence the tax. These decisions by tech is to... Save money by reducing our tax liability. \n\n&gt;Until it's utterly complete\n\nWhile there may be some folks that believe this. I think your lumping of all folks who desire a reduction of cars/parking spaces into one monolith is both reductive and unsubstantiated. Do better.",

Plus, I\u2018m like 99% sure that I\u2019ll get a D in this class. Wouldn\u2019t it look bad if I have to retake the class.? I don\u2019t think coding is the right fit for me... However, I did find myself increasingly drawn to the realm of website and application design as I take other classes. This shift in interests has led me to consider transitioning to the LMC major. Plus, I thought actively participating in clubs like the Design Club or WebDev Club may be more fun and offer me more practical experience compared to continuing with my CS classes. I was contemplating switching to industrial design, but considering graduating a year late and being unable to study abroad at my desired university makes me hesitant to pursue this route. However, I\u2019m considering to minor in it if I switch majors.\n\nNow the main issue I'm grappling with is uncertainty regarding whether obtaining a degree in LMC will notably enhance my chances of success in my future career. May sound like a nonsense but I'm worried how potentialemployers would view me as an LMC major pursuing opportunities in UI design (main) or Web Design\u2026 I feel like they will want more to people with ID/CM degree than a person with LMC degree\u2026 Am I just overthinking too much.?\n\nWill sticking with CM be better or switching to LMC and minoring in Industrial Design would be better and more helpful for UI designer??",

I've worked as a programmer, a QA analyst, did some non-major related work for a few years, and now I've worked as a product manager at my current company for about 4 years. I have objectively been a high performer at every single one of those positions, and I was straight up not a great student. No 4.0 semesters for me, and I had to take more than a couple of classes more than once. Data Structures...let's just say I became VERY familiar with the coursework of that class.\n\nDid that lock me out of a particular set of companies coming right out of college? Yeah, but unless you want to code in isolation all day or get paid the absolute maximum amount of money straight from the start, in hindsight that was a perfectly fine tradeoff for me.\n\nThe question \"What will my employer think of this degree vs CS\" was one that I was also constantly thinking about while going through the coursework. The answer is not a damn thing. Every school has its own little nomenclature for degrees and employers aren't bothered to care about the distinction. They care about the name Georgia Tech.\n\nHonestly, you are going to be 10x more competent than a CS major from 85% of the other schools you're likely to work alongside. Georgia Tech does an amazing job of making you a competent and thoughtful programmer.\n\nIf you love your LMC coursework including the tech-based classes and struggle a little bit with the CS courses, then I would say that you are in the exact right major.\n\nWhat I think I gained from going through the program that my CS brother and sisters do not is what I would call an actual well rounded education.\n\nI am both very technically proficient and also developed great interpersonal and communication skills that I think have done more to get me promoted and raises than any code I could have written.",

You're definitely right to overthink when it comes to this type of topic, but as an LMC major who is doing uiux design and got an internship this summer for design at a relatively well known company, I'd say lmc is not as bad as you think it might be :)\n\nI was a computer science major for my first year and I ended up fully hating it. But ux doesn't *require* coding knowledge so I switched out. But if you want to go into webdev, I'd suggest maybe staying a Cm major. I don't know anything about what goes on in coding classes, but from what everyone else is saying you don't need to be amazing in your cs classes.\n\nI've talked to many advisors recruiters and professionals in the ux design industry and many of them agree that your degree/major is not going to make or break your application. Your projects and portfolio will. This is why participating in clubs that have design positions could help you too.  \n\nFeel free to pm/dm me if you have any questions! I'd be happy to answer them",

I think a lot of people consider CS1332 to be one of the harder CS courses (save for 4000-level Networking courses or whatever). I think if you can make it through Data Structures, then you'll be fine. Also, I know several software engineers @ FAANG who have retaken 1332, so you'll probably be fine especially since you want to do UI (UX?) design which doesn't even use data structures.\n2. Plenty of people in the industry aren't CM/ID majors/equivalent. More design-focused majors will give you an advantage in having more projects/coursework that work with design for your portfolio. On the other hand, having a coding background definitely gives you an edge over other candidates because recruiters like to see that you can communicate effectively with the developers on your team. CM is nice because you get 1 thread LMC and 1 thread CS, so it's kind of the best of both worlds. Feel free to minor in ID if you have extra time in your graduation schedule but I don't think it'll make or break anything.\n3. Definitely continue attending Design Club, GT Webdev, etc. Clubs are a great way to gain experience and network. Especially for internships, it shows passion (where you will lack industry experience). Clubs also work on cool projects that you can use for your portfolio. They're also just a great learning resource because IMO there aren't a lot of courses that will help you learn UX (at least when I was a student).",

However, I have noticed that a lot of the programs have Academic Disciplines listed, most including Computer Science but not Computational Media.\n\nJust wondering if that means that I can't (or am not advised to participate) as a Computational Media major, or if they just clustered CM with CS when listing these out.\n\nAny insight would be helpful, especially from those in CM who did study abroad! Thanks!",

Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of companies that either do nuclear work or operate reactors, so that really tends to be the limiting factor. Adjacent work may help you get your foot in the door for the job that you actually want come graduation. I was able to get my foot in the door with a company through internships in adjacent works to get a job offer in the nuclear space. \n\n  \nYou'll land on your feet, you don't have anything to worry about. I have had several friends that I've graduated with that didn't have internships that got jobs right out of graduation, including in the nuclear world. Just come prepared to interviews with technical examples of how you solved problems (you can get this from your research experience) and you'll be in good shape!",

        "selftext": "Hi, I'm Will.  I'm currently serving as a Senator in the Graduate Student Senate.\n\nAs many of you are aware, SGA has been working to improve our RSO funding policies.  Today, a 72 page document was introduced to the Senate containing many proposed amendments.  I've attached the full document here:\n\n[SGA's Proposed RSO Funding Policy Amendments](https://gtvault.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/GeorgiaTechSGA/Ec6M58-7PcNMmRrjr09-ZYABq2746M5t_oH74zlx1uj0Tw?e=3TeoSY)\n\nI specifically would like to call your attention to the proposed amendments in Section 9.6, which **introduces hard caps on the total funding any one RSO could receive in a fiscal year**, Section 14.5, which **allows SGA to retroactively revoke funding that has already been allocated to an RSO**, and Section 4.2.5, which sets aside $75,000 for \"Campus Maintenance and Development\", thereby **reducing the funding available for RSOs**.\n\nThere are many other proposed amendments in the document.  Some (in my opinion) are good, some (in my opinion) are bad, and some are relatively mundane.  I encourage you to read the proposals yourself and come to your own conclusions.\n\nIf you are passionate about RSO funding, I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the proposals under consideration and make your voice heard.  **You can voice your opinion to the Undergraduate House of Representatives tomorrow (April 2) at 7:30 PM in Smithgall 117 (Flag Building).**  Likewise, **you can voice your opinion to the Graduate Student Senate next Monday (April 8) at 11:00 AM in Clary Theater (Bill Moore Success Center).**\n\nOne final note, I know many of the folks who have been involved with developing these amendments.  I KNOW that they are good, well-intentioned people trying to make a bad situation better.  A policy of this magnitude deserves scrutiny and passionate debate.  I am hopeful that any discussions generated by this post remain focused on the policy itself, and not the people involved with trying to fix it.",

                        "body": "This is a vast simplification of the issue, but essentially in 2020 Georgia Tech's lawyers rewrote the SAF funding policies, and removed the ability for SGA to have any discretion over funding decisions.  Every year, many RSOs apply for a budget through SGA.  Under the revised policy, if the total amount of funding requested exceeded the total amount of funding available, all budgets would be cut by a uniform percent such that SGA didn't allocate more money than was available.  Then Covid happened, and RSOs generally weren't requesting funding through SGA anyway, so the SAF reserves grew abnormally large and in the years following covid RSOs grew accustomed to SGA having virtually unlimited funding to distribute.  SGA burned through it's reserves pretty quickly, because under the new policy it literally did not have the authority to deny funding requests if funding was available (and the request complied with RSO policy).  The issue here is that there was nothing stopping an RSO from submitting a request for several hundred thousand dollars (which would never get funded at any other university) and forcing SGA to cut the budgets of all other RSOs to accommodate the exorbitant requests.  This came to a head this year, when the funding requested was more than double the funding available, and therefore all RSOs were looking at over a 50% budget cut.  To help insulate smaller RSOs that are relatively less able to solicit external funding, SGA amended its budget cut formulas to a bracket system, where the portion of a budget request below a certain threshold was reduced at a smaller rate than the portion of a budget request above a certain threshold.  This was viewed by some as \"absolutely shafting\" some large RSOs, but we we're all shafted regardless.",

Recently the lawyers have agreed to be removed from the process, hence the flurry of proposed amendments seen here.",

                        "body": "This is a fascinating point.  For a little bit of background, Georgia Tech (and I believe all other USG schools) has a Mandatory Student Fee Advisory Committee (MSFAC).  There are four undergrads, four grad students, and four admin folks that have a vote on the committee.  Every year (except for this year), MSFAC votes to set the level of each mandatory student fee.  Officially, this vote is a \"recommendation\" that is presented to President Cabrera, but in my experience President Cabrera legitimately values student input and, to my knowledge, has always accepted the recommendation of MSFAC.  At that point, President Cabrera officially submits the proposed fee rates to USG, and USG has the final authority to approve or deny the proposed fee rates.  However this year USG threw all of this out the window and mandated that all student fees be recalculated as if part time students paid fees at half the rate of full time students, and online students paid fees at one quarter the full time rate.  MSFAC was told by USG to not request any fee increases this year.  USG is going to look at what the new fees would be under that new system, and vote on potentially moving to something like that, which would shake up the fee level anyone pays.  TL:DR, nobody knows what's happening with fees this year",

        "selftext": "Hello guys I'm an international student committed to Georgia Tech for fall 2024 and I have a few questions and queries.I want to know whether applying for HP is a good idea. I've done research and found that HP students live in seperate dorms and have seperate classes with a small number of students. Will this limit the amount of friends you can make and make your college life bland and boring?\nAlso, I found that the hefner-armstrong dorms have community bathrooms. Is this true for all dorms at Georgia Tech or is it just for these dorms. I really would want to have a dorm with which the bathroom is connected and is just for the use of my roommate and I. \nLastly, I want to ask whether the HP is only for first year students or if it lasts for all 4 years. If it lasts for all 4 years then is it possible to change your dorm building after the first year?\nI know my questions might seem a little dumb but I am an international student who's never visited Georgia or GeorgiaTech so some help would be greatly appreciated. See you all there!",

                "body": "Hi, HP student here! TLDR: The honors program is worth it and I highly recommend. \n\nTo answer your questions in more details: \n\n1) We all live in Eighth St. Apartments. Freshmen used to live in Hefner-Armstrong, but now everyone lives across the street in 2, 4, or 6 person apartments where everyone gets their own room and there is a bathroom for every pair of two roommates (eg. the 6 person apartments have 3 bathrooms). The dorm style living spaces (which most freshmen live in) do have community bathrooms. I personally think that dorm style living spaces are better for freshmen to meet new people, but you won't be in the honors program and you will have to deal with community bathrooms in those.\n\n2) The honors program classes are optional and the vast majority of the classes we take are not honors program ones. It is cool to have access to that extra resource, but it really doesn't limit us in getting to know more people.\n\n3) You can meet tons of people through events and clubs on campus as well as through housing. There are tons of clubs that are super tight knit and will help you have a vibrant social life. There are hundreds of students in the honors program (roughly 200 a year), and that is where I have met many of my best friends. In my experience, the people I have met through HP have made my college experience far more exciting and you dont need to worry about HP making it bland.\n\n4) The honors program does last for all four years. In the past, students had the option to move elsewhere on campus and stay in the honors program, but now if you want to live on campus and remain in the honors program you have to live in Eighth St. You can still live elsewhere on campus in future years but you would have to leave HP to do so. You can always live off campus in the future and remain in the honors program. As you will find out when you come here, it is really hard to get on campus housing as an upper year. The honors program makes it MUCH easier to get on- campus housing.\n\n5) Other things of note: The honors program isn't perfect. The housing is a HUGE part of the benefit of the program, but you do have to live on West campus. I prefer West to East, but many people who want more parties prefer East. Also, if you are a business or LMC major, most of your classes will be a pretty far walk from West campus. Finally, companies I have worked for have liked seeing the honors program on my resume.",

I'm not sure the best way to send it to me, but if you pm me, I'll provide my email and maybe I can download it from there. Otherwise, you could comment or pm a link to the video via YouTube or Google Drive.\n\nThis will be used in a public YouTube video, so please be aware of that before sending me something you might not want out there.

As someone with the same hair texture, I usually find that they don\u2019t really handle the intricacies of it too well just bc there is so much to handle with layers &amp; texture. I usually dump a fuck ton into getting it styled rly damn well now after my many experiences with places like great clips (although that\u2019s just an investment I choose to make). I would suggest tho what the top comment says if u don\u2019t want to spend too much. I\u2019ve seen some hella good hair done by students and it\u2019s p cheap.\n\nAs for performing your normal routine before, it really depends on who is cutting it. I\u2019ve had ppl ask me to not wash it directly before so they can see it\u2019s natural state, or to wash it before bc they r more comfortable with freshly washed hair (like washes 30 mins b4). The consensus seems to be wash b4 although if u regularly see a specific person, ask them. Communication with the stylist is key",

        "selftext": "I recently got admitted to both the Georgia Tech MHCI (Specialization in Literature, Media, and Communication track) and University of Michigan MSI program. My goal is to land a job in UX Research field and was wondering what are y\u2019all\u2019s opinions about each of the programs?\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve learned that Georgia tech has lots of research lab opportunities, smaller cohort, and prepares people for the industry a lot through networking events, speakers, etc. However, getting Graduate research assistant and/or graduate teaching assistant jobs that helps with funding the masters program is very competitive since there are more students than the funding available. Although they said people can take courses across different tracks (since I\u2019m in LMC, I can fill out a permit to take other courses in Interactive Computing, Industrial Design, Psychology Tracks depending on how popular the courses are). I\u2019m a bit concerned that since I want to pursue the research route, I won\u2019t be able to take courses that I really want in other tracks and end up wasting my time taking courses in LMC that I don\u2019t really want to take. I also was hoping for career fair events that help students land internships, but it seems like there aren\u2019t many opportunities doing that since the events were dedicated towards networking instead of hiring on the spot (which basically feels like I\u2019m going to cold apply and wish for luck). The environment also seems pretty competitive (and it literally looks like I\u2019m working in an office lmao) since I\u2019m surrounded by people going into UX, but ig that\u2019s normal for both schools.\n\nFor the UMSI program, I don\u2019t really know too much about the program since I haven\u2019t been able to talk to many students/attend any virtual events which happens in April. Just by looking through the program, it seems to be pretty broad - covering programming, design, research which I felt like I was doing in my undergrad. And the cohort is larger around 200+ students? \n\nI have a few questions about the program:\n- How competitive is it to get graduate research assistant positions there? Is it easy to just cold email professors for research opportunities and get funding through there? Are the research labs literally school research or more industry based?\n- Are there career fair opportunities just for UX ppl to get internships?  Or is it basically just like LinkedIn where you talk to alumni about resume/portfolio feedback/referrals? \n- for the capstone project in second year, are students expected to develop/code the project apart from having to do the research and design work? Are students supposed to find their own capstone project topics or are they provided by e faculty/staff?\n- how rigorous are the courses, especially the programming ones? Do the courses dive deep into design and research that you can probably apply those skills in industry jobs?\n\nAny thoughts/advice/clarification would be helpful since I\u2019m so conflicted which school to choose. It\u2019s also hard to figure out which schools once I feel like everyone I talked to are so biased in their school.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1brue20)",

I recently received an email from GT offering me the Tech Promise scholarship and was wondering if it\u2019s actually that good. It mentions that it \u201cwill meet 100% of your financial need, assisting with costs associated with housing, food service plan, books, supplies, personal expenses, and, of course, tuition and fees.\u201d However, is this saying it will cover all costs for food, housing, books, etc? Or does it vary based on how much aid a student actually needs? \n\nThe part about \u201c100% of your financial need\u201d is really tripping me up. I was wondering if any of yall have experience or information to share. I couldn\u2019t find much else online that gave a definitive answer. \n\nAlso, I know I shouldn\u2019t worry about this, but is this scholarship actually selective? Or is it given to pretty much any student who meets the income requirements? \n\nThank you all!",

Tech promise is extremely prestigious, it only goes to 75 freshman a year, so congratulations!!! Also, if you ever decide to live off campus, tech promise will also provide you money for housing (up to the standard housing allowance that is stated in the COA). \n\nBasically, tech promise will help you get through GT entirely debt free, and you should receive a financial aid refund (mine was about $700/semester this year) to help you cover books and materials. If you have any questions, shoot me a message! Congratulations!!",

Huge assumption to think 2-3 week vacations are normal (especially if it\u2019s a far away or out of the country vacation). It should be, but it just isn\u2019t. For example, the median family income at GSU is around 60k which is much closer to the median American income of 70k. \n\nI do think the fact that a lot of Tech families don\u2019t understand this is part of the reason why these conversations can get\u2026uncomfortable. You don\u2019t have to be a millionaire to be actively more privileged than the populations that surround you (especially in Atlanta). And, it does occasionally come up in conversations about the atlanta environment. Mainly because they may be used to suburbia. And not even just any surburbia, but very specifically upper middle class ones (I personally come from the south metro rather than the north and get very\u2026surprised the amount of in state kids that actually don\u2019t know where I\u2019m from. I have some theories tho).\n\nEdit: big note that we are talking about the median, which means 50 percent of Tech families actually make *above* that. The median of the school is actually skewed up 25 percentile and 60k.",

I'm aware with switching my major, it would take me longer to graduate but thats fine with me if Im enjoying what I do and create meaningful projects.

EE and CompE curriculum is almost identical through the 2XXX level courses, aside from some extra CS classes that CompE\u2019s have to take, which you might already have credit for. After that, you\u2019d have to take 3040 and 3043 together, and likely 3025 at the same time, which is a notoriously difficult combination. They\u2019re very heavy on EE fundamentals: electromagnetics, solid state physics and circuit analysis. If you\u2019re not motivated to study these topics, it\u2019s going to be a very brutal semester. If you are, then you\u2019d be able to succeed, but not without a significant amount of effort.\n\nAfter that, you\u2019d just have threads left within the major and you\u2019d be able to study robotics and another thread. The robotics thread is mostly controls which is very math heavy, looking into systems, impulse responses, laplace transforms, etc. \n\nIf your interest is really only in robotics, I\u2019d probably recommend taking CompE, not because it\u2019s easier (I can\u2019t speak towards the difficulty of the major) but because I think it matches your background better and would probably be the path of least resistance to get there. \n\nAs for ME, I can\u2019t comment much on it either but I\u2019d probably say the same as EE; if you don\u2019t have any interest outside of robotics, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. However, their robotics program is different, and I\u2019d recommend looking into it to see if you\u2019re more interested in those topics than the EE/CompE robotics thread.",

If you are not familiar with the ATL DIY music scene, this is the perfect chance to get familiar with some of the best prog rock, noise rock, emo, shoegaze, and math rock Atlanta has to offer, alongside some acts hailing from outside the state. Personally, I just wanna let you know that you do NOT want to miss this as this is a once-in-a-lifetime lineup that will go down in the history of 1000 Couches and Couchella lineups!!! That's it, see you there! P.S.

We think it\u2019s worth it (but we\u2019re maybe a little biased, as we\u2019re hosting the event)!\n\nThis is the first time we\u2019re hosting Grad Gala since 2020, so there may not be many graduate students around who attended the last one. However, in 2020, tickets were also $45 and we sold out all 500 of them. The event was a hit!\n\nWe got a ton of support from the various Colleges and Departments to help us host the event this year, and trust us that we\u2019re subsidizing it as much as we can. Formal events (and especially alcohol) are just pretty expensive these days, but we\u2019re happy to have been able to not increase the cost since the last time the event was hosted.\n\nEach ticket comes with admission, entertainment, hors d'oeuvres, and two (alcoholic) drink tickets (non alcoholic drinks are unlimited).  We\u2019re happy to answer any questions you have about the event!",

I\u2019ve volunteered there once a week for over 3 years now, and I\u2019ve never met a more dedicated group. All the volunteers and workers LOVE those cats and will do anything for them. I\u2019ve genuinely never seen anything questionable go on. The cats all receive excellent medical care, as there are multiple vet techs and 1 full time and 1 part time vet on staff. And if it doesn\u2019t work out or your pet gets really sick and you can\u2019t afford treatment or for any reason whatsoever, they will always take back a cat adopted from them. It\u2019s also a cageless shelter, so you get to really interact with the cat and sit with them before you adopt. 10000/10 I love it there, cannot recommend enough.\n\nEdit: They also have a 96/100 rating on Charity Navigator and post their tax forms every year, so you know the finances are legit too.",

So basically, I wasn't sure about accepting the offer until recently, and I was more focused on looking for jobs in the earlier part of the semester.\n\nHowever, now that I plan on staying for a year longer, I am trying to look for internships this summer, but I know I am a bit late to the game. A lot of offers seem to be gone, and I guess I regret not being decisive about job vs internship earlier in the semester.\n\nIs it really too late to score an internship? For those who are still searching/have gotten offers really recently, what resources have been helping?\n\nThanks!",

I took calc BC in senior year of highschool and got a 4 on the AP exam, giving me credit for both of the classes. I am currently a second semester CS freshman. My uncle and an alumni from here keep saying that I should retake the classes because I will learn so much more than I ever could in the AP class. I do not care if calc 1 and calc 2 are harder here, I will find some way, probably (lmao), and I do not mind being \"behind\", as well as the money but what do y'all think? Are they worth retaking at GT? Or should I go ahead and go forward in multivariable calculus? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much :)",

Multi-variable calc is really simple in the beginning and you can refresh your calc knowledge during the first half of the semester. Shit gets quite tough and weird at the end of the course, but if you did well enough in the beginning, you will have a buffer. Even if you have to squeeze by with a C, it is much better than retaking.",

Calc at GT *was* harder - not because my high school was lacking, but rather because of all the tricky questions (I remember having to learn a bunch of trig identities that are more tedious than helpful).\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s a good advantage to come in with credit hours because they that to calculate your registration and housing times. Every semester has threads venting their frustrations with the whole thing. Unless you\u2019re an athlete or have accommodations that give you priority, every bit makes a difference imo.\u00a0",

        "selftext": "\\[Throwaway\\]\n\nI have some questions regarding RSO ethics and morals. I'm interested in gauging public opinion on distinguishing between behaviors labeled as \"college kids being college kids\" and those deemed inappropriate for a Registered Student Organization (RSO). I'm trying to ascertain whether my concerns are overly stringent or if there are genuine issues at hand.\n\n1. Regarding alcohol events without proper authorization and the presence of minors: While it's not uncommon for minors to consume alcohol in college settings, if RSOs hold unofficial events not listed on their official platforms (such as their Engage page), and fail to adhere to institutional protocols regarding alcohol events\u2014such as obtaining required waivers or appointing sober monitors as outlined in GT policy\u2014does this fall under the umbrella of typical collegiate behavior or is it inappropriate for an RSO? What about traditions at these events that involve getting minors to drink?\n\n2. What are your thoughts on RSOs using their funds for such events? This includes collecting entry fees or utilizing dues/fees paid by students for exclusive board/executive member gatherings. Note that in that last situation, the students who paid the dues/fees are not eligible to come to the events, only the board/executive members of the RSO are allowed. Additionally, what's your stance on RSOs potentially accessing funds from various sources such as SGA, RHA, or Parents funds for these events? While the funds might not directly finance alcohol purchases but instead cover expenses like venue bookings, is this practice acceptable?\n\n3. Concerning the use of SGA funds for purposes not explicitly indicated on invoices/bills: Given the challenges in obtaining funding from SGA, do you believe that if strategies such as submitting a bill for something and then utilizing the funds to do something else prove successful, they should be employed? I know SOFO reimburses clubs but I'm coming from the angle where RSOs might get invoices for one item from a vendor, and show that to SOFO, but then not use that money reimbursed for that, either through a deal made with the vendor or through refunds/returns offered by the vendor. This entails generating invoices that may not accurately reflect the RSO's expenditures.\n\nI'm seeking clarity on these matters to determine whether my concerns align with broader perspectives or if they are indicative of a more stringent viewpoint.\n\nIf this sounds reminiscent of ChatGPT, it's because I utilized it to refine the questions for clarity. English is not my primary language, and I wanted to ensure the questions were articulated as effectively as possible.",

Tldr, one bad apple can spoil the barrel :(\n\nFor the RSOs that are doing this, this is 200% NOT ok to abuse the system like this and ruin it for the rest of us RSOs who are working hard and doing our absolute best to comply with rules and regulations (there are so many already, it is what it is). Again, RSOs that are partaking in this this behavior *will* ruin it for the rest of us, and it's already as hard as it is getting money (re: SGA running out of money TWICE without any prior warning) trying to fund events for members possibly due to reasons like you mentioned, which makes me really sad and frustrated. Smaller clubs like my own are really feeling the weight/hit of these funding lapses in trying to keep member engagement up. \n\nI don't feel more can be done about the receipt issue without heavily impacting especially smaller and younger RSOs for the worse - I'd actually strongly advise against any further rules imposed on the rebursement process (we already submit a cleared bank statement and invoice) due to the funds OFTEN coming out of officers' *personal checking accounts* and then taking easily a month for reimbursement with the current process in place due to SOFO being perpetually broken for lack of better term. To put into perspective: when you're paying for *$3000 worth of food out of your own banking account* because you cannot in good faith trust SOFO to clear your GTF (if your RSO has one) or custodial account in time for payment, the last thing you want is for more delay on getting that money back from Parents Fund/SGA/Buzzfunds. \n\nI really do believe the majority of RSOs are here because they want to make a positive impact on the student culture and general community at large (my RSO is a small philanthropic one, and I know my board works and arm and a leg BTS to make it an org with a mission we stand behind), but unfortunately such issues will persist. I do want to take a \"holier than thou\" stance with my RSO but rather use it as an example of what most RSOs are doing - working hard and trying their best to comply with things. \n\nI think one way to combat this issie without massively impacting things for all other RSOs is ito make it so a student can file a concern/complaint to SGA about a certain RSO's misuse of funds for alcohol, SGA can conduct an investigation, and then use leverage of it coming back on the exec team + get the RSO advisor involved (also really sucky of the RSO to not consider how this could affect their sponsoring GT faculty :/).\n\nSo there's my unfiltered 3 cents heh :')",

        "selftext": "Hey! I am submitting this as an update to a post I made on this account a few months ago\n\nLink: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/17b26d9/maybe\\_i\\_do\\_not\\_belong\\_at\\_georgia\\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/17b26d9/maybe_i_do_not_belong_at_georgia_tech/)\n\nYou can (probably should) read that post for context. TLDR for this one: I am still not really doing well. I am unsure if this school is a good fit atp. I especially would appreciate advice from those who have taken alternative routes to get here (or even left if you're in this subreddit!). Also, students that aren't so intensely stemy.\n\nI have tried a lot of the advice given underneath the post. I didn't give up and I have been doing well on paper. But, I feel like I am in a dark place mentally.\n\nI have meet more people, but this school makes everyone so busy and I am just not high on people's priority list. I wish I at least had a consistent study group. I finally started psychotherapy and medication for my ADHD which has helped, but it does hurt when they recommend \"body doubling\" and I have no one to do that with. It feels like I am lost in a sea of people. It doesn't help that their productivity doesn't motivate me anymore. It just makes me feel like I am wasting all this time being sad when I am suppose to be actually working. Self fulfilling cycle.\n\nI'm not sure if I like my major anymore. I dread taking upper division courses soon. I feel stuck because this school is such a stem bubble, so I feel like if I choose another option I am going to be fucked. Probably not realistic, but I have no idea what to do. The only classes I really enjoy taking are LMC courses and some maths. That could be a solution instead of just transferring, but I am completely unsure of what to do. I feel like honestly I should've went to a school with a bigger arts department, instead of such a STEM heavy school. I have a lot of different hobbies that I would to realistically pursue, but the bubble makes trying too feel futile. I feel like being here has changed me in a bad way.\n\nI have tried so many different ways to be happier here, but it seems most of my complaints come back to this school's environment. I've have done so much personal work to try to become \"better\". I think atp I have used up most of my avenues. I might be clouded in my judgement, but something about being here is very depressing about being here. Part of it is probably that it feels like others don't share my feelings, which I know is not true, but it's hard to gauge that when it seems no one really wants to gain or deepen their friendships with me. I have joined support groups which make me feel a bit better, but idk.\n\nI don't feel this way when I am at home, even tho I don't even *like* being at home. Coming back here after spring break made me very emotionally upset, and I have tests coming up that I need to score high on. And homework due right after break. etc etc. So now I feel like my rest isn't even due. I kinda dread being here. I don't want to feel that way. I don't even really have anything to look forward in the summer except sleep since I haven't gotten an internship or well *anything.*\n\nWhat I do know is that I feel significantly better around people from other schools in the area. Which, in theory, should be easy to find a tech equivalent, but it's not happening. It makes me feel trapped since obviously I spend most of my time here, so this should be the environment I at least mildly enjoy.  I know some of the judgement is in my head, but they feel a lot less judgy and have things they do that aren't pure academic pressure points. They are hobby groups here, but having conversations just leads straight back to how \"oh I didn't sleep because I studied all night\" or \"Oh I'm have like 3 tests this week\" like omg. I just want somewhere that's a complete destressor place. The times I have found those, people don't come long term! I'm in groups on campus that have dwindled down to 3-4 people. (Feel free to recommend orgs below, there's so many here so this might just be a spotlight issue).\n\nThey also seem to just judge me less...socially? Like no offense to anyone here (please I get it I am also nerdy and introverted), but a lot of y'all are socially awkward to a fault. I have the most luck making very temporary connections at parties, otherwise I am not sure what I am doing that's wrong. I have had long talks about it with my therapist, and she has some theories about me (I'll only expand if asked lol). This makes me hesitant to give up entirely, however,  I even see this problem in a lot of group activities I do (not even trying to make friends I just want to work on projects efficiently). I am definitely a similar breed, but that feels so weird! Why am I one of the *more social* people on campus but the least social at home??\n\nThere have been events this semester I have enjoyed, but they are dampened due to how much WORK I have despite not taking that many credit hours (I have a grivance which a certain class but I don't want to say too much). So, either I go to the event and feel like I could've used that time doing work, or I do the work and feel stressed. This is something I have personally improved, however, this late into the semester makes me feel like I'm playing catch up. I am seen as quite bubbly and personable to many, so no ones really check in on me. I feel not only isolated but a bit masked as well to people.\n\nIt even got to the point I decided to attempt to look at some actual social clubs. For some, that would mean greek life. Being black (and a women since people did not clock that on my last post. Might be part of the reason why I feel the way I feel about these orgs) I tried to attend some Divine 9 (google if needed) related events. However, I do have some reservations about them, which is a whole other conversation. In short, I realized even if I joined one, my problems wouldn't be solved really.\n\nThe institution is also irritating me (again). I feel like I'm jumping through hoops to fix problems that aren't even my fault. It can take days for them to reply to me, and I even once got an email reply after I got no confirmation on something basically saying \"students aren't told every step of the process\". I just wanted to know if they received my documentation or not :(.\n\nThere might be something that I should do that I am missing. I already contacted a friend to talk about it since I know people (even you people of reddit), would prefer to hear my problems than hear that I had a mental health episode. But yeah, it's heavy times for me.",

The STEM thing is all a big joke at the end of the day, people put way too much weight on the idea and that influences how they view GT as a whole. LMC, Business, Design etc are all great majors here with awesome professors.\n\nAlso, you are welcome to transfer colleges, but I'd be surprised if much changed socially. There are obviously some awkward people at Tech, but by and large it's the same people you'd find anywhere, just maybe a little more GPA focused. Stereotypes can influence how we view our environment and you might be stuck viewing Tech through a stereotypical lense. There are friendly people everywhere here, they might just be doing their own thing. I'm telling you this because I'd hate for you to put in all the effort to transfer schools only to realize the grass isn't greener.",

I don't know much about transferring majors, but I'm sorry things have been really rough for you. \n\nI empathize with the imbalances of communicating with others. That issue of you being the only one to reach out, or the only one to coordinate plans, was something I had to navigate the beginning of this fall. \n\nMy solution was to find activities that I was comfortable doing with others (if they happened to join) but that I can do on my own. Furthermore, I try to seek out people to talk to one on one (since groups are more difficult to work with sometimes), and after that, I opt for studying hard and doing research I care about. As my schedule continues to get busier, I have less time to worry about other people, allowing me to more naturally stop communications with someone if they haven't consistently reciprocated. \n\nIt's important to remember that the lack of communication isn't your fault, but that means you've got to also identify what makes you content, happy, or gives you meaning separately from others. I wish you the best of luck with everything, and please be kind to yourself!",

I was also female, (although not Black or a minority,) way back when the ratio was I think even smaller than it is now, and I felt quite alone and struggled a lot my freshman year too. \n\nBeing a female at Tech can be very isolating in a lot of ways, especially in certain classes. And not having a social scene you feel connected to can make it even harder. I appreciate all you\u2019ve done to try so hard and to try and change your circumstances. \n\nI will say that the best decision I made (and it sounds counter intuitive) was to take summer classes after my freshman year. I met some of my best friends that summer because it\u2019s a much more relaxed environment, professors are generally more chill, and the things going on around campus were more fun to me. \n\nAlso you say you aren\u2019t looking forward to upper level classes, but I found those to be easier and more helpful in making friends as well because they were smaller and required group work, and often had the same people in them. I settled into my niche part of campus that way rather than being in giant lecture halls all the time. \n\nI wish you all the best, no matter what you decide. Tech isn\u2019t easy and you\u2019re already this far, but you also shouldn\u2019t sacrifice your own mental health. Good luck.",

But that doesn\u2019t really work. For one thing, that group will break up at some point, likely sooner than you think, and if you\u2019re not actually close to anyone in it you\u2019ll be back at square one with no friends. Going to a club or joining a frat isn\u2019t going to actually create the closeness you\u2019re probably seeking unless you actually make an effort to build relationships with the people there. Otherwise you will have no more socialization than the obligatory \u201cgroup events\u201d that everyone in the club is invited to and even those may not be super fun if you don\u2019t really talk to anyone there. They can be a good jumping off point, but you should focus more on individual friendships. Don\u2019t be trying to get in with that big, loud group - they all already have lots of friends. In stead, go somewhere *consistently* - it doesn\u2019t really matter where, club, gym, study sport, can all work - and try to have a conversation with someone there. Again, not someone who is part of a big group, just someone who is alone or with one other person say and who is there regularly. Then when you find someone you enjoy talking to, ask them if they\u2019ll be back, get their number, make plans, etc. It\u2019s also likely this new friend had a friend or two who you can now also make friends with.",

He switches spots with one of the guys staying inside.\n\nAnother half hour later, he also bangs on the door - he's a devout Jew and doesn't want to be near a pig since they're \"unclean animals\".

The person I spoke with made it seem you won\u2019t be able to choose your roommates, room, building, floor, anything. I was specifically told they\u2019d assign us as they see fit to make fall move in easier. They said that the two places we signed on the housing contract about self assign basically aren\u2019t applicable. \n\nI\u2019m posting here because when I asked where this info was released I was told they did not post anywhere, and I find it very disingenuous to make a major change like this without notifying anyone. I\u2019m just sorry I didn\u2019t know about this when I filled out the housing form.\n\nIf I have any incorrect information I\u2019m happy to edit the post, just going off housing help desk correspondance.\n\nEdit: for context I\u2019m a junior BS student, no clue what\u2019s going on with ignite or for grad students",

Currently targeting April 9th-11th, but the final / official dates will be emailed soon.\n\nEdit: To clarify, incoming first-year dates and process will look a little different. You'll get program specific  information soon.\n\nApologies for the delay - long day. There are a few reasons why there might be some confusion:\n\n* If your fall assignment is in one of the buildings that will be open this summer, we will pre-assign you to your future fall space, so you will not have to move at the end of the summer\n* Similarly, if your current spring assignment is in a building that will be open for the summer, we will pre-assign you to your current room\n* These steps will be taken in that order and before the self-assign period begins (so someone else can't take your room). You can technically change it during self-assign, but... please don't\n* For all other returning students, self-assign is tentatively scheduled for April 9th - 11th, but we will email out more info and confirmed dates soon\n* **If you are a grad living over at Tenth and Home this summer**... you will not have a self-assign period. There are major projects happening in that area, and multiple buildings will be offline. Our team will assign the very few spaces that are available in the most efficient way possible. These students have been heavily communicated with over the last few months though -  I think the initial communication about the project and it's upcoming impact went out like a year and a half ago. Family residents should have received an email today about their assignment, and individual grads should receive their assignment email tomorrow.\n\nI'll speak with our team tomorrow to make sure we're communicating correct information.\n\nHope that helps - let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nCC: u/International_Air561, u/Classily_Classless",

(Assuming you are referring to OMED's Challenge Program)\n\nThey will definitely let you leave if you have an emergency, but you won't really get days off, only hours. If you have to leave, you'd need to contact your assigned counselor and let them know what's up.\n\nChallenge is a very intense program that simulates a 12 credit hour late summer short semester, meaning 4 classes over the course of a month. On weekends, there will be lots of activities you will be required to attend, from volunteer work to career development to company field trips. In fact, we usually did a full career day with several company executives visiting. I don't know if it's still done, but we also did white water rafting and a talent show every year. I think the students also got one weekend off to study for finals, but that's about it.\n\nWith all of that plus classes to keep up with, your schedule will likely be so full you wouldn't have time to go home.\n\nI'd recommend contacting OMED and see if they can give you the full schedule of activities so you can plan.\n\nHope this helps!",

The prox chip can be cloned pretty easily (I've done it before). So can the magstrip on the card. And when BuzzCards used to have a barcode printed on them, well... those were pretty easy to clone too.\n\nHowever, to my knowledge... the MIFARE DESFire EV2/3 chips have not been compromised, hacked, or cloned to date. Some of the older chip technologies designed in like 2002 have been hacked, but not the latest ones. The new door access system uses these DESFire chips.\n\nI had other security improvements in mind when I mentioned it, but this is a good one too.",

Also, I'm not certain if this is allowed to be posted, so I do apologize mods.\n\nSince the beginning of fall semester, It's been extremely tough for me.\n\nI had a bad breakup of two years where I invested everything into it. I dropped everyone for her, and suffocated her due to it. I wanted to spend 24/7 with her, and once she left, I had noone and nothing to be happy about anymore. She's since found someone new, which also now crushes my heart even further, that someone can move on just like that. My view of love is that I'm willing to work through anything with someone and dedicate everything to them, but parts of that view is just so twisted, as much of it is rooted in insecurities and selfishness. I never changed during the relationship, and only is changing somewhat now.\n\nI also feel so behind compared to my peers, and feel like I haven't made any meaningful relationships since I've been admitted. I've tried clubs, talking to people in my classes, and continuously pursued contact with the people I've already met, but I still feel like I'm just slowly suffocating myself to death. I've tried care, but It kind of was a repeat of everything I've tried, being the typical do new things meet new people, but I just don't feel like I connect with anyone. Everything above has been a detriment to my mental health, and my overall motivation, and I feel like I'm just spiraling out of controlling right now.\n\nI really feel so alone right now... I really don't know what else to do at the moment. This spring break has been just reminiscing about the time I spent with her, but she loves someone else now. It's been around half a year now, and I just feel like I'm slowly killing myself.\n\nOn the topic of meeting someone new, I've had a few girls ask for my number, but my heart just doesn't sit right with it. It feels like I don't click with any specific one of them either. This isn't the love that I imagined as a child... My heart hurts so much :)\n\nI know I haven't matured yet, but if this is maturing, I don't want it. I want a childish kind of love, but It feels so hard to love anyone else at the moment... I know my mistakes, but I can't change them anymore. I need to move forward, but It's been so difficult.\n\nIs anyone down to talk or give me some tips? I'm really sorry if this doesn't belong here haha.",

It seems your identity was her and now you need to find who you are.\n\nEveryone feels behind all the time - I promise you are not alone there. Instead of comparing yourself to others, evaluate how you feel about your progress. What are your goals at Tech (I hope to get an education)? Write down your goals and hang them somewhere. Remind yourself of those goals and that those are what you work towards, not being like someone else or \"catching up to peers\". Honestly, when guys give me trouble is when I work the hardest on my grades/other goals.\n\nSoon all this will pass and you will find someone else. In the meantime, find contentment in singleness (and don't feel pressure to get in a relationship either, I joke that there is no reason to settle until you are at least 30 :)).\n\nIf you are religious at all I'll leave you with this: God has a plan for your life. All you need to do now is sit back and let him take control. Don't worry about tomorrow because he's got it all.\n\nPraying for you.",

That I should go to clubs, go to parties, go to bars. I just don't know why, but I don't want to do any of that. it doesn't sit with me morally, and I'd prefer if the one I love doesn't do so either. It's an immature look at things, I know.\n\nI also wished I was religious. She was too and I regrettably mocked her for it because of how immature I was. Because of my athiesm, I am a nihilist, and just want to make the person I'm with happy in the end. \n\nOverall, I think my mindset needs a complete change. I'm just a bit sad right now still. I'm not sure where to start. Could you give me some things that I should work towards right now?",

Work to build a future for yourself and the people you care about now (maybe parents or siblings). If this doesn't work, maybe money isn't your goal. Do you want to help people? Maybe you want to make a product to help people of a certain demographic?\n\nHere were some of the goals I made for myself before I even got on campus - granted some of them are kind of silly given I was young, but still:\n\n1. Make someone smile everyday\n2. Trust God in everything\n3. Do my best in my classes\n4. Stand up for my beliefs\n5. Participate in research\n\nI actually still have those as well as some new ones I have added saved to my desktop so I see them everyday.\n\nAs for your other things:\n\nDon't feel pressured to go to bars or clubs or anything like that. Anytime anyone tells me to do that I just say \"No thanks, I'm not into that stuff\". That is not an immature point of view at all. I much prefer having real, meaningful conversations over loud music and drunkenness.\n\nI know you say you aren't religious, but surprisingly many of your morals seem to align with religion.\n\nYou can completely ignore this next part, but I just wanted to put it out there in case you have been feeling this way: Sometimes we just need to hit the bottom before we can realize the truth. Even though you have gone through rough times, God is waiting for you with open arms. No matter what you have done or how lost you may think you are, he forgives and he loves you. Unlike humans who come and go, God will never leave you. I have also gone through some rough patches where I have felt completely alone, and those are the times I grew closest to my religion. If you want to discuss religion at all let me know. You seem to be questioning, that's why I bring it up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd for your internships, you're a second-year - go for it!

I want to make enough money, and work from home, so that we can spend more time together! I get lonely really easily, kind of like a bunny! I think overall, I'm a very selfish person. I do want the one I love to be happy, but I also want to be with them all the time. I need to work past that before anything else, but it's so hard since she's gone now. \n\nI really never had high aspirations. I never wanted to be CEO, I never wanted to help lots of people, I'm really just a selfish person. I just want to be with the one I love. \n\nI'm scared I'll never meet anyone with the same morals as I do. I do realize that my attachment style is very unhealthy, so I'll work past that for now. I know I have to.\n\nI started fencing alongside other hobbies, but stopped because I felt so depressed. I realized I started them to impress her, but should really start attending again haha.\n\nI really did wish God was real, but I'll be honest, I'll never believe. I'm too rooted in reality. I really did wish there was a heaven. We had a plush daughter named Bunbun. She has since then told me that Bunbun is just a plush, and that Bunbun matters nothing to her anymore, but I can't take her back because it'll just remind me of her. I hope she went to plushie heaven... I don't want her to suffer on this earth anymore.\n\nI'm so weird. I've tried all of the methods to move on. It's really not helping right now. I still cry every other day. I feel so dejected. I'm still such a baby.\n\nI ultimately don't have any personal goals to work towards that I want. It really sucks. I was too codependent, and now I'm suffering due to it.",

                "body": "I want to start off my saying your feelings are completely valid to have. That\u2019s not just \u201ctherapist talk\u201d, that\u2019s the truth. You invested a large chunk of yourself into this relationship and now that it\u2019s gone, it has you feeling lonely, dejected, and betrayed. Those are all normal feelings to have after a breakup. How do I know this? Because I went through the exact same thing you\u2019re going through. Literally, it is almost exactly the same. I had a relationship of two years, invested everything I had and more, thought I was going to marry this girl. Then sophomore fall comes along and she breaks up with me to start dating someone else. Reading your post is almost verbatim exactly what I experienced. \n\nThat said, I\u2019ll comment here, but if you want to talk in more detail, my dms are always open.\n\nI want to try to address each of your points in the order you wrote them, and then give my opinion and how I got through it. It\u2019s going to sound harsh, especially right now, but you need to hear it. I always want to emphasis that you won\u2019t get better right away. It\u2019ll take time. Even more time than you have already given it.\n\n\n\u201cI invested everything into it. I dropped everyone for her. I wanted to spend 24/7 with her\u2026\u201d \n\nit sounds like you already know this, but I want you to recognize that this is not how relationships should work. I\u2019m sure you let her keep her friendships, but then, whenever you tried to hang out with your friends, she complained about not spending time with her, so you slowly started to ignore your friends. That\u2019s not how relationships work. You should be allowed time for your personal friends (and relationships) and she should be allowed time for her friends (and relationships). Note: relationships does not mean romantic. Hopefully, this breakup will show you that this is an unhealthy/toxic relationship trait. Although, it might take a few more months to recognize this.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s since found someone new\u2026she can just move on like that.\u201d \n\nIf there\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned, is that girls don\u2019t just \u201cmove on.\u201d She most likely had ended the relationship mentally weeks before. Note: this is just my personal experience, yours may vary. But, I could tell something was up weeks before I got broken up with. I just didn\u2019t imagine it would lead to us breaking up. So, take a hard look at the last few weeks of the relationship and see if she seemed more distant, or if arguments suddenly stopped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to work through anything\u2026and dedicate everything to them.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re religious, but something that helped me, after talking to my priest, is the idea that God should be your number one relationship. That your relationships should point to God and not dominate God. What this means, is that you should feel the way you described towards God, and then lesser towards your mortal relationships. If you\u2019re not religious, take it like this: relationships shouldn\u2019t take precedence over your own well-being. They should only enhance it. (Obviously there will be times when they do not, but that does not necessarily mean they are bad relationships.)\n\n\u201cI feel so behind.\u201d\n\nI got C\u2019s and honestly didn\u2019t even care about school for the entire fall semester after the breakup. It\u2019s normal to lose all interest in school. Maybe consider taking a semester long break to rediscover yourself. But I honestly, would advise against it.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t made any meaningful connections\u201d\n\nConnections are hard to make. It\u2019s relatively easy to talk with people. More difficult to deepen those connections. All I can say to this is keep trying. Some of my best friends were people I had only passing contact with for an entire semester until the last week, then we got super close super fast, and completely unexpectedly. Honestly, and I am being 100% honest, download hinge, bumble, (maybe not tinder), and go on dates, or even just text people. Don\u2019t look for anything (not hookups, not relationships), just go and talk with people. Use it as a way to get to know people and ask people more personal questions, even if they don\u2019t lead to anything. Use it as a place to try and develop deeper connections, because that\u2019s kinda the point of them. Listen to the podcast \u201cPeople I mostly admire\u201d no. 126. It\u2019s about having deep conversations. \n\n\u201cThink about Time spent with her\u201d\n\nMost importantly, stop doing that. She is out of your life now. She is not coming back. Don\u2019t try to Gatsby your way out of this. It\u2019s not going to happen. That was the hardest part for me. There\u2019s this sort of glory or honor that you can trap yourself into, thinking it\u2019s honorable to wait for her. Don\u2019t do that. There\u2019s nothing honorable about making yourself feel terrible. \n\n\u201cHad a few girls ask for my number\u201d\n\nThe good news is\u2026you\u2019re still attractive! And I\u2019m going to be honest, after the breakup, I didn\u2019t really start to deeply connect with girls until about 2 years later. I had hookups and flings that I was attracted to and cared for, but none of them that I \u201cloved\u201d. And I got called out on it by one of them. It took me a long time to feel comfortable, to feel safe to open up again and give myself the opportunity to be hurt again. My guess is the reason you don\u2019t \u201cclick\u201d with them is because you\u2019re either 1) comparing them to her. 2) are afraid to be vulernable because the last time you were, you got betrayed. Or 3) both. It takes time to heal, so don\u2019t expect to get right back into another deep relationship immediately. Find a way to let yourself be loved, and to love others. It\u2019s easier if you make yourself vulnerable to your friends first. Also, Ted Lasso has unironically good examples of mantras and mental health for men.\n\n\u201cI want a childish kind of love\u201d\n\nThe good news is, childish love still exists. But you have to choose to have it, and that requires being vulnerable. What is a childish love? It\u2019s a love that loves 100% without fear for the consequences. If you are afraid of the consequences, you will never have a childish love. It\u2019s easier when it\u2019s (I\u2019m assuming) your first relationship. Harder once you\u2019ve been hurt. But you have to give yourself time to heal, otherwise it won\u2019t get better. It took me 2 years to heal. But each day was a little bit easier.\n\nOkay, I think that answered your things. Now to talk about my experience.\n\nIt hurt. It really really hurt. For a long time. More than I\u2019m willing to admit. I wasn\u2019t necessarily suicidal, but I wasn\u2019t really enjoying life. I had a panic attack after seeing her driving with her new man. The panic attack was terrifying (but I did go and hit a bench press PR afterwards that took another year to hit). The point is, healing takes time. I wasn\u2019t back to 100% until 2 years later. But, I was back to 50% by about the 6 month mark. And 80% after about a year. I think you might be in a similar boat. There\u2019s good days and there\u2019s bad days. And I think it will probably take the same length of the relationship before you\u2019re finally fully over it.\n\nThings that helped me. Going to the gym (cliche). Im still there every morning at 6am. It doesn\u2019t have to be weightlifting, but gaining some muscle is always beneficial for confidence. It also doesn\u2019t have to be the gym (although I strongly recommend getting in shape), it could be art, poetry, writing, paintball. Do something with your newfound time. Learn something. Friends are helpful. I know you\u2019re struggling to find them, but lean on anyone you have. Parents, family, siblings, etc. Stop following them on social media. Seriously. Nothing beneficial will come from seeing their life without you in it. They didn\u2019t want you in it, so don\u2019t try to keep up with them. There\u2019s no reason to. \n\nGoing back to Ted Lasso, don\u2019t watch \u201csigma male movies\u201d like blade runner with Ryan gosling or American psycho. Those just mess with your mental state.\n\nI want you to know, it does get easier, and eventually you will get over her. I\u2019m living proof. I\u2019m now finally getting into another fulfilling relationship, and it feels amazing. But, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without finally allowing myself to open up and be vulnerable.\n\nMy dms are always open if you want to talk or hear more about my experience. Feel free to interrogate me!\n\nAlso, watch [this](https://youtu.be/ZQht2yOX9Js?si=dsdAMenN0RRJM64k).",

You need to move on before trying to be with someone new. Instead of trying to heal your wound with others, you need to heal yourself first.\n\nEveryone will say these things, but instead of trying to socialize with people you don't enjoy being with, you can set hobbies and goals for yourself. You should do things that will keep your mind busy, or you can prevent yourself from thinking too much by exercising and tiring yourself out. Whenever I don't occupy myself with something, I always think about depressive and negative things. But whenever I keep myself busy, these thoughts never come to me. I'm not saying you should keep yourself so busy that you die of exhaustion, but you should find something to devote yourself to. \n\nFrom what I see, you're attempting to commit yourself to a person, and that might not be the best course of action. I believe that by prioritizing your own happiness first, you'll eventually encounter someone whom you'll love again. Instead of seeking someone to make you happy, focus on creating your own happiness first. Then, aim to find someone who will complement and share in your happiness.\n\nBy the way, I think that childish love is something you can experience no matter how old you are. Also I'm slightly older than most of the current college students and doing undergrad here and I cannot connect anyone in my classes. I enjoy talking to them but it is never a deep level connection. So don't feel alone on that part.",

Do you not get brought down by the barrier that everyone feels like they have up.\n\nI wish I could help you find happiness, but honestly, I'm struggling myself. Lots of people my age have finished school and some are even starting families. Coming from another country, where relationships mean a lot, it's tough here where everything feels kind of shallow. Maybe it's just part of growing up, or maybe it's because English isn't my first language, but it feels like this language makes everything less real. It's been getting me down, and I've been keeping to myself more. I'd rather have a few real friends than lots of superficial ones. Most of my interactions now just feel like small talk.\n\nBut even with all this, I find moments of happiness when I can accept how things are right now. Sure, there are days when I can't quite do that, but I'm learning to just wait for those feelings to pass. But honestly I always feel like I'm always waiting for something to be happy. For example I think I will be happier when I graduate, I think I will do this and do that when I graduate. Or I think when I have a meaningful relationship I assume I will be happier. But this is all wrong. I think happiness is just in the small things but we still spend all of our live waiting for to be happy. \n\nMaybe you should just give some time to yourself to feel these feelings little bit. It is okay to feel lost. There hasn't been a time in the last 4 years that I haven't felt lost. \n\nI'm wondering, what were the things that made you happy before you got into a relationship with her?",

This girl is a drop in the bucket of your life, and you won't think about her for a second when you find the person you are really supposed to be with.

I can't change what I haven't started. I'm behind lot of students here, but I've made it my goal to start somewhere and achieve small goals and slowly change/modify them to achieve larger goals.\n\nThe same applies to making friends. I struggle with friendships too, but I'm forcing myself to get into various things. I make time to attend various events and just try to enjoy them either myself or with the people there, without expecting to form any friendships because quite honesty I might not see these people again. Biggest thing I'd say is get into things your interested in and can do by yourself, and do them consistently. This way you can connect with other people over shared interests and start forming friendships.\n\nI'm not a therapist, but if you need a friend, I'm always down to meet on campus and have lunch, no pressure! I've been meeting people from this subreddit here and there and its helping me get over my anxiety of meeting new people and helping me feel less lonely :)",

Just remember to be kind to yourself and take it at your own pace, you have to remember you have so much life ahead of you, and it\u2019s okay to take your own time. I\u2019d also recommend going fully no contact with your ex as well, it\u2019s not that you stopped loving her, but it\u2019s for your healing considering how codependent y\u2019all were for each other. \n\nWhile you do all that, just make sure you do things FOR yourself, no one else. Maybe it\u2019s join an IM sport, go work out, read more books, watch more movies, etc. Ideally something that gets you actively engaged and piquing your own interests.\n\nYou\u2019ll make your way out of this maze eventually, the problem is that for a lot of people, they think that \u201ceventually\u201d means months or weeks when it could be years. You got out of a LONG relationship, that shit will stick in your heart forever. Just keep the faith and love and forgive yourself and you\u2019ll make it.\n\nYou can also DM me if you\u2019re comfortable with that. We could chat or get coffee if you\u2019d like.",

It\u2019s normal to feel down or even enter a temporary acute depression for a bit after a breakup, particularly when\u00a0it defines a large portion of who you are. Humans aren\u2019t meant to have that much of their personal identity ripped away from them, especially when they\u2019ve only just started figuring out who they are. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you.\n\nYou can (and will) 100% bounce back. It\u2019s really really really hard to imagine that things will be okay. But they kinda just\u2026 will eventually. You\u2019ll meet closer friends (even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it now), find more things you enjoy, and start doing things that give you purpose. Your brain will slowly make sense of what\u2019s happening, re-anchor itself, and heal. And slowly, but surely, you\u2019ll start feeling happy and you\u2019ll get back to normal. It might take many months, but it\u2019s a process. Humans are beautifully resilient creatures.\n\nBut, a part of that process above is taking the time to think about what happened rationally (or at least not shut down your feelings). You might not feel rational now, and that\u2019s okay. You might try a thousand different frameworks of thought, and that\u2019s okay. But eventually, you\u2019ll need to be honest with yourself and process everything. It\u2019s easier to forget than it looks.\n\nYou\u2019ll be good, although it might take awhile to start to see that. No matter what happens, everything will be okay. If you want to talk, dm me (although I only use reddit when I\u2019ve got a specific question, so I might take a bit to respond lol).\u00a0",

Congratulations, you're already at the top of the first mountain - you recognize that you have a flawed view of relationships. A lot of people never recognize this, and you should be encouraged by this all because this is a profound growth opportunity for you.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a good therapist, and stick with it. Work through this stuff. It may not feel like it's helping at times, but you're young and have time for things to click. You just need to put in the self-work and ultimately a lot of these issues will probably be okay.\n\nSide-note: As an adult (31 as of this past week), one of the biggest things I recognize in peers my age, and even in myself, is that a lot of people still struggle setting boundaries for themselves and for others around them. Boundaries, and communicating them properly and clearly, are really important - they are what we use as safeguards to our peace and serenity in life. It's important to be very conscious of how you set and maintain them, and you need to be paying attention to how often you shift the goalposts on these boundaries (super common mistake the make out of guilt).\n\nYou'll come to find that if you work on boundaries and communication that it will ultimately put you far ahead of the curve emotionally, but also in your career. Good luck. You're going to figure it out! :)",

If I allow myself to think about it too much I start bawling, and I don't cry normally. I pray we both find the connections we yearn for and need.\n\nVolunteering can help. So can just making someone else smile. Turning your focus on the problems and needs of others can sometimes put yours in perspective, I suppose, though I personally believe we all have battles to fight (though some may not seem like battles to others). Helping someone else can bring a purpose and joy more longstanding than any temporary, fleeting smile.\n\nEdit: I've read a few of your replies. You seem to really be struggling, and an adamant atheist to boot. I'm not going to preach at you, bc I doubt it will be heard. Several other commentors have worded things well already, and I don't know your beliefs well enough to speak to you directly. But. I know God is real bc I'm not dead yet, and many other reasons besides. I also know that He has to step back and let us try, and fail, and grow and develop. We can't be flat Mary Sues, as the literary equivalents of never failing are known. It freakin hurts too. A relationship and belief in him isn't a get through life easy card. It's a steadfast rock of love to cry on sometimes, and stand proudly on in others.",

It feels like we're rushing to rapidly increase incoming class size without taking the time to prepare for and explore the nuanced effects of such a drastic change; why the rush? Is there some USG-related or other motivation that I don't understand as a student? Also, is there a target size we're aiming to hit and then we stop?",

But then it's also wanting to get more rural students, more women, more students of color (without reducing the other cohorts), also as more students go towards stem degrees (nationwide), those colleges are in higher demand, plus Atlanta overall being a bigger destination for people worldwide...plus (and this is a softer stat) but they need to keep georgia politicians happy and those guys get really riled up with their kid with the 3.8 gpa doesn't get in and they can't figure out why. \nwith all that said, I'd keep the enrollment small and let the growth happen at other state colleges.

This in turn allows us to attract and hire top tier talent, not just at the facility level but also for positions like president. \n\nCriticism of such fast growth is well known and acutely felt at all levels: not enough instructors, not enough classrooms, not enough lab space for research, etc. I would agree we're growing too fast. But I also suspect that progress isn't kind to folks that move too slowly and to some extent it's necessary to move at the pace we're going to remain competitive.",

This is my second semester, and academics-wise I'm doing fine, 4.0 GPA but that may change due to mental health issues and burnout.\n\nGonna be blunt, I just don't like the vibes here. Everyone's always too busy to go out, studying, working on their homework with their headphones on, etc etc. How do you meet people? What do you do after you're done working? Why aren't there more social events and mixers? The only way I made friends here is through clubs or approaching them in public (which is hard because everyone is always hurrying to their next class :/ )\n\nI mean don't get me wrong, there are fun people that do club activities but, those are usually once a week and it's really hard to form proper connections. You try to meet them outside of club hours, and everyone's busy with work. The only really sociable people I met were from frats, but a lot of them tended to have very toxic mindsets, especially towards girls, which I didn't like. I didn't know frats were a thing before coming to the US lol\n\nSpeaking of girls, how are you supposed to meet girls here?? I only dated 1 girl here so far, and I met her at a mixer during welcome week. I know that as a guy, I'm supposed to approach girls and be proactive but, how am I supposed to do that when all girls do here is study with their headphones on?\n\nI'm staying off campus very close to tech square. There are tons of amenities like a swimming pool, outdoors seatings, lots of rooms and screens that you might use to watch movies or play games. But noone uses them, they're always empty lmao. I guess people prefer to stay home and study. I want to know, is the situation better if you live on campus? Do the RA-s organize weekly social events? They used to do that at my previous college.\n\nWhat should I do? All of this + classes + pressure to find a job + TA work has been too much, and I'm cracking. My family noticed that I am depressed and burnt out. Having a gf really helped, cus I had someone I could see every day, but now I don't even have that haha.\n\nDo I change housing? Get a car and find friends at meetups and bars? Transfer? And if so, where? What colleges have a better work/life balance? Preferably with a smaller campus where I'd be living close to my friends and seeing them every day",

Can you reach out to people you sit beside in your classes for a study session? Then, that can turn into one on one or group activities if you have similar interests. Can you go to a club that\u2019s interesting to you and make a plan to study or hang out with those friends, too?\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult for some to maintain relationships when they don\u2019t occupy the same spaces as their friends. The people here are really great, but a lot of times, you\u2019ve got to reach out first- which can take a mental and emotional toll after a while. If you reach a relational burnout, it\u2019s okay to step back or change your social circle.\u00a0\n\nBest of luck, OP!",

It\u2019s a super welcoming club and as a strange human myself I personally felt included and really enjoy getting to know everyone in the club!\n\nThe club meets four days a week (you choose however many days you want to go to) and post-practice meals are very common. There\u2019s also planned social events and trips that people go on together. I\u2019ve also seen plenty of YJAC people hanging out outside of the club, so there\u2019s plenty of that. \n\nI think orientations are done for this semester (only four-ish weeks left), but over the summer / next fall you can totally join if you\u2019re looking for a club that does stuff outside the club itself!\n\nAs for relationships, I can\u2019t help you there lol. But if you\u2019re interested, feel free to reply in thread or DM me about archery! It\u2019s a great club!",

Let's close Ferst, Hemphill, and possibly the bits of 8th and 9th inside campus to most cars, allowing access  only for deliveries, maintenance vehicles, and some special circumstances. The shuttles been be replaced by a nice efficient tram, while the parking lot underneath Klaus can be converted into 3 floors of desperately-needed CS classroom space! Other parking lots could also be put to more productive uses.\n\nI know it's crazy, but how hard would it be?

Does the section that still exists on campus actually impede pedestrians to any marked degree, given that pedestrian flow in that area is almost all parallel to it (i.e. going to/from the campus core)?\n\n* Atlantic used to go all the way from 10th to 4th, but is now 87% closed  (~2,300' vs ~200') to non-institute traffic.\n\n* There was a giant parking lot bounded by Van Leer, 4th, and the Architecture building.\n\n* There was a north/south road between the above-mentioned parking lot and Ferst. \n\n* There was a giant parking lot where Clough is now. \n\n* There was an east/west road on the north side of Van Leer between Atlantic and Ferst.\n\n* The area on Ferst where four Greek houses are across from Russ Chandler was a giant parking lot.\n\n* Bobby Dodd Way and the following section of Cherry Street up to Ferst were open to all traffic.\n\n* There was a u-shaped driveway north of the library with ~75 parking spots along it.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of the core of campus within the area bounded by Ferst and Techwood is now open only to institute-only traffic. But no, none of that is enough for some folks.",

I remember it was somewhere in the span I could see when Tech got above a 3-average. Here's what I could see from the public one, filtered to undergrad only. Small technicality, but the average for *students* probably lags slightly behind the average for *classes,* and is skewed slightly by transfers and the varied time to graduate.\n\nEdit: can someone reply if the internal one goes further back?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0nvresrm5pc1.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80f06d429c1a5f3ce6df6e7a5277bd425a2ca22a",

They also require a B average (3.0) to graduate, and B's or higher for classes in your specialization - so they can build the classes to require knowledge of certain topics to get a passing grade. I have already seen this in IIS, with problems worth 20% that cover a specific topic/exploit for a mini-project that distinguish between an 80% and 100% (straight, no curve, so a B or an A).

In my time as a student I've done a few SWE internships and, while I generally enjoyed the experience, it was hard to imagine myself doing that \"forever\" (even admitting that an internship is far from the intensity of a full-time career.) \n\nAs a result, I want to take a crack at undergrad research and see what the world of research and potentially academia are like. Seeing as I've still yet to complete my junior design option I'm seriously considering the research option as opposed to, say, working on a VIP. I had a few questions for anyone who has done the research option as a result:\n\n1) Did you find the research option useful to you long term? Would you have preferred to do a more industry focused choice like project-based/VIP?  \n2) Did you pursue grad school directly after graduation, or did you go into the workforce?   \n3) What was the outcome of the research option like for you? Was it just \\~9 hours of research work or did it result in anything like a journal publication, conference presentation, etc.?  \n4) And most importantly... do you recommend the research option for someone looking to try someone new?\n\nThoughts and answers to any of these questions would be greatly appreciated.

                "body": "Currently in the middle of the research option, so I can't speak entirely to the end results. Having said that:\n\n1. The research option has proven to be reasonably helpful. It's certainly helped me enhance my technical writing skills (which imo everyone should have decent experience with in today's industry). I'm personally leading my own research under faculty advisement (through UROP), which is why I prefer it to group-based project options like CREATE-X, VIP, or capstone. I know most research options involve joining a lab, though you could always try reaching out to a faculty if there's a particular project you had in mind.\n2. I'm planning to pursue grad school more or less immediately after undergrad (planning to take a 7-month gap for one semester + the summer, as I'm graduating in a fall semester)\n3. I did 3 hours of research for another research team in my freshman year. Last summer, I did the asynchronous proposal writing class. This semester and last have been research semesters for my project. I'm taking the asynchronous thesis writing class this summer. The goal is to finish data collection this semester/this summer, spend the summer writing my thesis, and have it published in a journal by the summer.\n4. The research option is not for the faint of heart, especially UROP - it requires a lot more independence than capstone or VIP might (no idea how CREATE-X compares tbh). Having said that, if you're disciplined with your time management and commitments, when else are you going to have the chance to just casually try out research like this? Make sure you're working on something you're actually passionate about (don't just join/start a research project if you're not at all interested in it, as it gets a lot tougher to try and stay engaged).\n\nOverall, I can definitely recommend the research option (especially UROP). Be mindful of it and don't do it just to try \\*something\\* new. But if research is something you really want to try and you're passionate about or interested in the subject at hand: why not give it a shot? Ultimately, it's a choice based on your interests, your own time management/discipline, and your plans for the future (grad school, etc.) I've really enjoyed it\n\nP.S. Reach out to the [undergraduate research ambassadors](https://urop.gatech.edu/content/undergraduate-research-ambassadors) (URAs) if you want to learn more - they usually do an info session around now iirc.",

I'm definitely planning on pursuing grad school directly after graduation. Like you, I haven't been overly enthused with software engineering so far (I want to spend my life solving hard, research-style problems instead of developing infrastructure or managing some kubernetes cluster). I honestly really love the research we do and working in the lab is probably the first thing I could actually clearly see myself doing \"forever,\" so grad school is the natural next step.\n\n3. I basically spent my first two semester just learning a LOT. I work in AI/controls and there are some incredibly math-heavy papers and unfamiliar concepts that I had to understand to get up to speed. I didn't spend as much time on research during those two semesters (maybe 6-ish hours a week) as I do now (closer to 15). In retrospect, I probably could've started working on projects after less time learning; but, I wanted a deeper understanding of the field and the grad students who've been mentoring me were happy to support me through that! \n\nThis semester, I'm getting paid and starting to really work on paper-able projects. I'll likely have a not-first author paper out soon as I'm helping a grad student run experiments. I'm leading a few projects which will hopefully yield a first-author publication (or two) sometime later this year. Ultimately, I plan on continuing to conduct research for the remainder of my time at Tech and I'd conservatively expect to publish maybe 4-5 papers (1-2 of which are first-author). This is just my prediction based on very limited experience, though!\n\n4. Yes! I tried research semi-arbitrarily tbh, but I've fallen in love. I love the team that I work with and the new things that I learn and I'm excited to start publishing to get something out there! \n\nHowever, it should be mentioned that research is hard and time-consuming. You get what you put into it. Each three-credit class is meant to be 9 hours of work per week, and you probably won't gain much unless you put in somewhere around that, on average. How your research goes is entirely up to you. You could spend the entire time learning nothing, not asking questions and barely understanding a paper or two, or, you could publish several papers and truly engage yourself in the lab (even in just those three semesters / nine credits). \n\nHow much work you're willing to put into \"something new\" is up to you!",

Independent research shows above and beyond that you are a self-starter. That's the kind of person you want to hire in the entry-level: someone who can take a directive and largely figure it out without hand-holding (while not being so stubborn not to ask questions when blockers arise). \n\nSpeaking of \"something new\".... One of the students that worked with me years ago primarily did research on learning AI for fighting games by monitoring the game state in memory (I think, technically it was a bit above my head). A good advisor will let you go in the direction you are truly passionate about while giving you guidance to keep you focused on reaching the goals you set at the beginning of a semester. Choosing a subject you are genuinely interested in makes it feel like a relief from your regular classwork, rather than a burden. You'll need the right faculty fit for this approach. The best audition is taking a class taught by a faculty member you want to do research with, if possible.\n\nDon't focus on outcomes, focus on process. That being said, the bar to do a poster presentation is not very high and is a good entry point to publication as an undergrad. \"Presented at PRESTIGIOUS\\_CONFERENCE\" is good enough, poster presentation or no. Most people outside academia don't know the difference between a paper or poster, anyway.\n\nIf you plan to go to grad school, having faculty that can vouch for you is an incredible advantage. I know it carries admission weight, again largely because doing independent research shows you are a self-starter.",

I wanted to share an exciting extracurricular leadership opportunity for those of you who are already involved in research.\u00a0Undergraduate Research Ambassadors (URA) is a peer mentoring organization within Georgia Tech's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program. The ambassadors help other students navigate the research process by holding weekly office hours and organizing events throughout the semester. Mentoring opportunities range from helping students join a lab to guiding them through the application process for scholarships like the President's Undergraduate Research Award (PURA).\u00a0Applications to join URA for Fall 2024 are currently open, and they will close next Sunday,\u00a0March 24th. The application consists of a streamlined form at this [link,](https://urop.gatech.edu/content/undergraduate-research-ambassador-guidelines-and-application) as well as a faculty recommendation\u00a0(which is also due on Sunday, March 24th). Feel free to check out our [website](https://urop.gatech.edu/content/undergraduate-research-ambassadors) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gt_ura/) for more information. I am currently an ambassador, so feel free to ask any questions, and I will do my best to answer them! ",

                        "body": "I am very sorry to hear about the ghosting! I think cold emailing is the most common way to join a lab, but there are plenty of other options. I personally joined a lab through a summer REU in a Georgia Tech lab, so I would suggest looking into some of those if you are free this summer. Even if it's not an official REU program, I have heard that joining a lab is easier in the summer because there are less people on campus. You can also reach out to a former class instructor that does research, since they are much less likely to ignore you if they know you personally. \n\nIf that doesn't help, I would suggest going to an undergraduate research fair/showcase, since a lot of lab PIs and grad students go to those because they *want* to recruit undergraduate students for their labs. You also get an added benefit of meeting potential PIs and grad students in-person rather than over email. URA hosts an undergraduate research fair every fall, but some departments have their own fairs, as well (I know mine does)\u2014so keep an eye out for networking events like that. There is also URA's annual [Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://calendar.gatech.edu/event/2024/04/16/undergraduate-research-spring-symposium) coming up next month, which will mostly have undergraduate students presenting, but there should be some professors there, as well. \n\nFinally, you can check out the Pair Me [website](https://pairme.aep.gatech.edu/); it is basically a database covering research and VIP opportunities at Georgia Tech, but unfortunately, I think most students don't know about it. Lots of labs put out job postings on there if they are looking for undergraduate students to help out in their lab. I hope this helps, and good luck!",

Both were less stressful than I expected and felt more like a conversation than an interview!\n\nSomething I *always* recommend is reading about the research projects in the lab you want to join before the interview, since it shows that you are interested in what they do. No one will expect you to know everything about your lab's area of expertise at this stage, but a little bit of preparation can go a long way! \n\nThe dress code honestly depends on context. Formal clothes would probably be best if you're interviewing for a very competitive REU, but if you're just meeting a professor you cold emailed, business casual will suffice. I personally wore dress pants and a nice blouse for both of my interviews. There is also nothing wrong with emailing the interview organizers to ask about the dress code.",

Same with transfer students I think - transfer in as the major you want to be.  Once you hit 60 hours much harder to transfer anyway.",

As others have said, Georgia Tech purposefully took specific action to prevent the very thing you are trying to do.   \n\nAs in, the college of computing already has sooo many students with sooo many other undergrads switching their majors to CS that they made the decision to eliminate this pipeline.\n\nThe best programmers I knew at Tech were EE or MATH majors anyway.   If you have your heart set on a career in programming then absolutely nothing is stopping you from taking many of the same classes that CS folks take, or unofficially auditing courses and learning the material yourself.\n\nMost companies who recruit CS from Tech will also consider CS adjacent majors.... the drawback is that the CMPE and EE curricula are tougher than CS.   IE is also worth a look, but its not as intuitively similar in most people's minds, i think.",

Banner is (currently) hard-wired to work with Oracle's RDBMS and runtime suite. Of the major SIS (Student Information System) offerings, it's the one with the largest market share and has an international reach. The vendor has around 3,000 Banner  customers...where the ENTIRE University System of Georgia (USG) counts as ONE such customer.  GT, being a unit of the USG, naturally uses the product ; in fact we ended up as the test case for it in 1996, before the USG adopted it systemwide. \n\nOh -- Ellucian is jointly owned by Blackstone and Vista.\n\nThe \"new\" Banner 9 registration system in Banner (which we call OSCAR) exists for 2 main reasons. A) Oracle has end-of-lifed the fundamental technology whereby web pages are rendered by stored procedures in the database. B) Ellucian is working to push all their clients into their SaaS (Software as a Service) universe -- which uses a PostgeSQL database (junking/replacing several million lines of Oracle PL/SQL in the process of escaping Oracle's egregious licensing fees).\n\nThe new product is written in Java -- with all the benefits and blemishes that implies.\n\nGeorgia Tech (and the USG) is almost a decade late in converting to Banner 9 registration.\n\nDoes that help?",

The class is pretty test heavy(i.e. the only things that affect the grade are the midterm and the final). I had studied so much, and came to class basically everytime, and even I helped a classmate who did well study. Even the professor was surprised I did so badly. I guess  it must have been an off day. I talked to my advisor and he suggested I drop the class. \n\nI understand that withdrawing from a class won't screw me over long term, especially considering that I have a high GPA in a hard major (AE) but I'm still feeling down about the fact that I dropped a class and have been in an emotional and mental slump for the past 24 hours. Any tips on getting past this?",

The first semester of my MSAE program here I failed a midterm, refused to withdraw since I thought I could stick it out, and ended up getting an F in the class.\n\nI have two takeaways from that: first, my previous success made me blind to my potential failures. Just because I did well in the past doesn\u2019t mean I get to rest on my laurels. Second, know when to call it quits. I had an insane courseload and really could\u2019ve used the extra study time elsewhere instead of wasting it failing for that second half of the semester. It would\u2019ve been much better for my mental health and GPA to just take the W.\n\nI think you made the right choice. You aren\u2019t the first and won\u2019t be the last to have an uncharacteristically bad exam grade. Happens all the time, and your life will absolutely go on just fine.",

I had him and his course was 40% midterm, 60% final and he didn\u2019t assign any readings or homework either. \n\nIf it\u2019s any consolation, I did the exact opposite as you. I made a 100 on the midterm (even though I spoke with friends after and know for a fact I made mistakes on the exam), so I felt pretty good about the final. I took the final, never got a score back, then final grades were posted and I made a C in the course. I emailed Kardomateas to ask for a bump and he said I made a 72 in the course and wasn\u2019t getting it. I guess you can do the math to figure out what I made on the final but I never bothered.\n\nMy advice is to not let it shake you. You\u2019re going to have good days and bad days, and you just got unlucky your bad day happened on a big midterm day. If my hunch is right that this was Kardomateas, I especially wouldn\u2019t let that sway you because he was an awful professor.",

BST Remove, Quicksort, etc.), you break it down into what each line of code is accomplishing, and write out that line. Then you turn that line-by-line description of the algorithm into a mnemonic device/acronym that you will memorize. The second you get that exam paper, write out the mnemonic device at the top right corner, and then reference it to make sure you don\u2019t miss a single step. If done correctly, even looking at the letter \u201cA\u201d will remind you to add the node to a list, or whatever. \n\nJust what worked for me, good luck!",

That's why we don't type code in notepad, we use an IDE. And that's why to survive a bullshit test like this, you have to resort to bullshit tactics like memorizing code.\n\nI wish you luck and hope you do well. My advice is to give yourself mock exams. Practice writing the code by hand and give yourself a time limit. You will get better at it. And keep reminding yourself that none of this will matter after you graduate.",

Usually, memorization will lead to a decent score, but will lead to errors on certain leetcode-like questions on the exam where memorizing certain algorithms could yield incorrect answers (Think the most recent BST challenge question). Instead understanding the algorithms before the exam then applying the technique used to create the algorithm will help you excel, and even help you become a better software engineer.\n\nIf you want a good idea on how to prep for the coding questions or maybe the multiple choice/diagramming, go to Office Hours and ask one of the TAs on duty to walk through how they take one on the practice exams or maybe a specific question from the exam. This way you are able to receive live feedback on your approach to solving the questions or maybe a learn a new way to tackle the questions on exams. Id be happy to walk through questions from the exam to show my thought process for some of the questions when I was taking it if you pull up to office hours or make a private post on piazza about it (my notifs r on so I can help ASAP if it's on there).\n\nI also suggest going to recitation the day before the exam. Depending on the TA, we will go over the process for solving common exam questions (usually on the worksheets we give out), maybe walk through a coding question, then take any questions regarding taking the exam or content that could be covered on the exam. Overall, just make sure to understand the topics in depth and situations where a certain algorithm might be applicable. Don't stress about it, you got this :)",

Personally I agree complete memorization is not the move but neither is no memorization. Write the code again from scratch by thinking through the logic ( do this in black pen) come back and fill in ur errors in another color and understand WHY u made those mistakes/forgot. Did you not understand the data structure construction? Was it silly syntax (like incrementing a size var)? Are u missing a concept you need to review (like recursion or pointer reinforcement)? Then keep writing it over and over again with the same process and you will begin to see patterns in where you struggle. For me it was recursion and pointer reinforcement but by the time the test rolled around I understood it. So to an extent you should have them memorized through logic bc of the time crunch if that makes sense? It\u2019s not brute force. But it involves memorizing.",

For those my best advice is just to do the worksheets provided under in resources in Canvas, they give you some pretty tough coding problems.

This is because \"normal\" maths is straightforward, one equality leads to another and after doing tedious algebra, you are done. However, in physics, you can \"skip\" a lot of steps usually. This usually means to observe a phenomenon, or realizing a physical fact, and you use it in your equality, which would not have been possible if  you didn't have an understanding of physics. Additionally, it is harder to set up initial equations in physics because you need to understand the problem. Luckily, you can study both the same way, do a lot of problems, redo them, and deeply think why the steps are true. I am sure the professors said it, but reading solution is not the same as doing problems.\n\nMath on a higher level changes a lot, and is much more interesting, you will see something in CS2050, but imo it is not the best taught/designed class. You should try doing upper level math if you find it easy.",

I was so worried about the cars who sped RIGHT by me while I played ball with bumpy pavement. Likely didn't help that I was having some issues with my bike. Besides, you still have to rejoin the sidewalk eventually to get to most buildings, bike racks, etc. Pedestrians walk proudly down the center of all the mixed traffic sidewalks, so me carefully going down the right side of the sidewalk (and yielding to all pedestrians) really doesn't give me an ounce of guilt.",

There's also [this](https://news.gatech.edu/news/2023/01/23/parking-and-transportation-services-launches-new-hybrid-bus) article, which says the bus operates fully electric for 20% of the route. Other hybrids are similar. It's not going to be half EV Mode and half ICE. And all of this assumes there IS an EV mode on the bus to begin with. Modern plug-in hybrids have an EV mode, while older hybrids might not.",

There's also the fact that electric buses are expensive and the current transportation fee wouldn't cover it. Public schools that got electric buses almost always had state or federal grants to foot the bill. Bringing electric buses to Tech would cost tens of millions. They're in PTS' roadmap but the funding isn't concrete and we won't get electric buses until we know where the money is coming from. \n\nTrolleybuses are another solution but the overhead wires are unsightly and I bet there are other reasons we don't see them on college campuses.",

I've been actively participating in various events, going to clubs, playing sports and trying to make friends across the spectrum, but I seem to struggle particularly with forming deeper connections, especially with someone who could be a potential girlfriend. My main motivation is seeking emotional support and companionship, as I've found myself in need of a supportive partner who could be with  me go through a very rough patch in life. Most of my friends are male, and while they're great, there's a certain level of support I find missing. It\u2019s  about finding a genuine connection with someone who understands or shares similar values. If you have any tips, insights, or if you've been in a similar situation and found your way through, I'd really appreciate your guidance. Feel free to DM me if you prefer sharing privately. If you also looking for a partner DM! Thank you!\n\nI\u2019m aware of the trolling, but I had been keeping this with me for too long. It has been affecting my mental health for a long period. \n",

But, you have consulted the internet for advice, and I will see to it that you receive it. \n\nBased on your post, it seems to me that you probably have watched some tv shows/movies that has friends constantly hanging out and just having a good time. You, most likely, have a really good group of friends that you hang out with some times, but are craving this \u201cmovie friendship.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, this \u201cmovie friendship\u201d does not exist. There will be times when your friends are there for you and times when they are not. I, personally, have amazing roommates, but some times they all are gone over the weekend and I have no one there to listen to my problems, and that feels isolating.\n\nI bring this up to show you, if you have friends, the only thing preventing them from becoming deeper connections is yourself (or themself).\n\n\u201cBut, random stranger on the internet, how do I go about creating this deeper connection??\u201d You might be asking. It\u2019s simple. If it\u2019s guy friends you\u2019re talking to, it honestly might be worthwhile to just straight up say \u201chey man, I want to talk about more personal matters and be there for each other emotionally more often.\u201d Guys are relatively receptive to this and usually want to have deeper connections (like you) with their friends, but societal constructs have made it hard.\n\nAnother method that works is \u201chey man, I truly appreciate you. And I want you to know if you ever need to talk about anything, I\u2019m here for you.\u201d\n\nSide note: NEVER text these things (if it\u2019s the first time saying it), these can be uncomfortable to say, but that stress is what makes it so much more meaningful.\n\nAll this to say, figure out WHAT exactly you want by \u201cdeeper connections\u201d and really attempt to get that out of your current friend group",

I'm broadly interested in specializing in compressible fluid dynamics which I intend to continue studying for my PhD.\n\nI'm really keen on joining the program, but I'm beginning to feel that Tech's Aero department is a whole lot more active on the combustion side of things, and most of the aerodynamics research (computational and experimental) is focused on rotorcraft. By contrast, UIUC aero seems to be active in all spheres of aerospace engineering.\n\nAm I correct in assuming that GT is more of a rotorcraft-focused school, or am I missing something here? Can someone give an overview of the aerodynamics work at GT? Thanks!",

While I'm not all that familiar with the vertical lift lab, I do know about two other labs active in the field. \n\nThe first is the Ben T. Zinn Combustion Laboratory. The second is the Aerospace Design Laboratory (ASDL), which primarily focuses on systems engineering and vehicle optimization. Although ASDL's main emphasis is not on compressible fluid dynamics, there are numerous opportunities to engage in projects related to CFD and high-speed aerodynamic design. However, ASDL has limited experimental capabilities as it is not their main focus.\n\nOn the other hand, as you mentioned, the Combustion Lab and the Computational Combustion Lab are heavily involved in both computational and experimental work related to compressible flow, although in the realm of combustion dynamics. There are a few projects I am aware of that work with computational compressible flow on the aerodynamics side inside the combustion lab, but it depends on the project.\n\nOf course, this is coming from someone who isn't involved on the aerodynamics side so take it with a grain of salt, but I hope this helps!",

He applied about this time too, and they looked super hard to find something for him that wasn't just sit in office and answer emails.

The research option states that\u2019s you have to have 5 out of 9 research for credit (the other four can be audited), which means 5cr CS 4699 and 4hrs CS 4698. The exact statement was also apparent in the CS junior design completion guidelines, but underneath it there was a requirements section which showed 3 credits as options between CS 4699/CS 4980 and the other 6 as strictly CS 4980. I don\u2019t know the difference between these two, and I really want to audit some hours in the summer to avoid paying expensive tuition. Is it possible to audit 5 hrs for RO in CS junior design? How many hours of 4980 do you have to have?\n\nThank you in advance for those answering my question.",

I am in-state and I was thinking if I there is any way I could take classes at GSU to quickly finish all my humanities and history requirements. I didn't come in with credit for these and I feel like doing those over the summer at GSU will be easy and will help me take fewer classes when my coursework gets harder over the next couple of years. How does the application process work if I am able to do this and what you would suggest? Thank you for your time.",

I don't recommend doing them during the summer or at another school.\n\nIf anything, I'd take the hard core classes like Math and Science/Lab electives at a Georgia Perimeter college or GSU during the Summer instead since they'll be easier than doing them at Tech. And you'll get them out of your way. You'll want your hard classes during the main semesters to be only your major courses, adding hard sciences/math on top of that makes your life much harder than just having an easy humanity taking up space instead.",

So it is possible, but you'll have to come in with quite a few credit hours and take a higher than normal course load to do it (including some summer semesters). \n\nHopefully this advice isn't outdated. Also, other people might have different opinions, and YMMV.\n\nYou should make sure you genuinely enjoy both majors. I think the general consensus is that having a second undergrad degree doesn't make you more employable than having one undergrad degree + internship/co-op experience. So you probably shouldn't do this if your motivation is just to get a job (although maybe there are some niche jobs that need both EE and Math knowledge, idk for sure.)\n\nIf you can afford it, taking 4.5-5 years to double major might not be too bad, especially since you'll have a lower course load each semester. I don't think employers or grad schools will look at that too negatively.\n\nIn EE, you'll probably want to take classes in signal processing, control systems, and/or info theory as those are the more math heavy areas of EE. \n\nFinally, try not to take Real Analysis and Abstract Algebra in the same semester since those will likely have proof intensive homeworks due regularly. You don't want to pull two late/all nighters each week.\n\nThat's all the advice I can think of right now. Good luck!",

But if you're really interested in mathematics, and you're good at building intuition for math by yourself, and it's more recreational/curiosity based for you rather than based on career interests, I would just major in EE and learn the math on your own later on. The reason is that all the rigour and heavy workload in mathematics classes (or any subject for that matter) in my opinion doesn't translate well into *actual understanding* of the topic, just the ability to churn out results, with the drawback of having to do countless of exercises that the professors want you to do, rather than the ones that actually interest *you*. All the while, not giving you additional employability benefits. In fact, just putting down that you're interested in mathematics and read a lot on maths on your resume will already boost your chances of getting an EE job -- no need for that extra degree, unless the job specifically requires it. That will give you more time to learn mathematics in the way that interests *you*, and if you're talented this will actually be more productive and give you more long-term advantage.",

I was young and had a twinkle in my eye).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst debit cards became a thing, but not everyone took them in the mid 90's and it was expensive to wire money from one regional bank to another.\n\nNowadays there are at least half a dozen ways to electronically transfer money and regional banks are almost unheard of.   The only remaining reason to give your student buzz funds would be to prevent them from using the money to splurge on something besides food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a roommate who spent his cash on a 3D card for his computer and ended up eating my Tostitos over thanksgiving when the meal halls closed down.  I still remember the Hunt for Red October movie poster I hung on the door to our dorm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYO THE 90's was WYLIN, Y'ALL",

If the institute/college actually cared about funding these scholarships, I'm sure that allocating just 5k from the 70k overhead for each phd student per year would fund plenty of undergrad and omscs scholarship recipients",

Think wiffle ball on steroids. \n\nHere\u2019s a video of an example game\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8jH2JEL84Fo?si=DZhruFsvbEaZgM4B\n\nOur club rules will be slightly different, and we don\u2019t have massive dedicated mini-stadiums, but you get the idea.\n\nParticipation costs nothing, and we\u2019re looking to grow the sport in the area, so we plan to start slow and build up, so it\u2019s a perfect way to get off campus and meet new people, as well as something fun to do with friends!\n\nHere\u2019s the discord we\u2019re going to use to organize games\n\nhttps://discord.gg/cumjWrHX\n\nReach out if you have any questions; I hope to see you on the field!\n\n",

So I went to Google to look for a number to call and saw the reviews and wowwww, they have a 1.4-star rating with sooo many people complaining about never getting their pics in the mail or getting poor quality pics AND the promo codes not working. Why does GT still use these people?  Anyways, any recs for local studios in Atlanta for grad pics or local photographers because the reviews are off-putting, not gonna pay for that!!!  \n\n\nTLDR: GradImages seems to do bad business, please recommend some photographers and or local studios for grad pics.  \n ",

People seem to already have their own groups and are not willing to accept anyone new. I try to attend club events, but even then I still feel like a stranger and outsider from the various groups. Even when I try to converse with someone in my class, it just gets weird and they just sit somewhere else next time. I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll graduate soon and it\u2019ll be useless if it\u2019s like I was never even here or create any meaning memories, or have the proper college experience.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me or it\u2019s just the environment at Tech. When I was at GSU, I was a little successful in getting positive interactions and meeting girls but it\u2019s worse here. I have no hope for dating at all either. It gets lonely a little now that I\u2019m in dorms this semester, but I try to keep busy to not think about it as much.\n\nI might be complaining a little here, but I just wanted to know if anyone feels/felt the same way.

It\u2019s called \u201csocial dancing\u201d for a reason; there\u2019s no romantic subtext involved.\n\n(2) ORGT \u2014 outdoorsy people are generally quite outgoing. Maybe it\u2019s the sun. Go to some of their meetings, and maybe sign up for a trip or two. It\u2019s incredibly cheap and incredibly fun.\n\n(3) Intramural sports \u2014 there\u2019s random groups of people playing sports at STAMPS all the time. I met my best friends one Wednesday afternoon playing soccer. Just ask, and don\u2019t be afraid if some people say no. They won\u2019t remember you.",

Some will be \"F\" (Fully at a Distance). \"H\"  (Hybrid - in-person *and* online), or \"P\"  (Partially at a distance).  These are referred to as \"Instructional Methods\".\n\nIt's also helpful to know the \"schedule type\" for each section.  Lecture, Supervised Lab, Unsupervised Lab, Seminar, Directed Study, Recitation,  &amp; Studio are probably the ones of most interest to a First Year Student.

Early courses such as 1331 and 1332 are in person paper for instance (oop and data structures) and even 2110 sometimes is depending on the prof which is the basis for a lot of the more hands on courses.\n\nMath courses and other are all in person paper too.\n\nThere are ***some*** hybrid / online options, but the consensus is that you only register for those as a last resort imo since you're forced to learn solely online vs at least having the option of an inperson class and help if you sign up for in person sections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of us (myself included) are guilty of skipping and tbf it's entirely a valid option if you learn better alone, but for a lot of coures, you can't really have a better/faster time than with lectures and being able to talk to your profs and TAs. There tends to be a lot of internal mobility though beween sections of large courses (e.g. if im signed up for prof A in section A and I just decide to go to prof B's lectures cause i understand them better). It really depends a lot on your ability to force yourself to focus and work on your own, and the support network you build with friends and peers in the same classes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImportant to note as well: a lot of core classes require attendance or something along those lines. E.g. from my experience:\n\n\\- Combinatorics\n\n\\- Psych\n\n\\- Probability and statistics\n\n\\- 2110 and 2200 (though tbf these can be done via reading the slides afterwards for lectures -- labs require physical tap in id card attendance sometimes)\n\n\\- etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of classes have recordings but an equal amount if not more don't. Also, if you don't go in person, you pbly won't watch the lecture if you're being honest.",

I am a veteran so people say that is a lil bit of a boost during the acceptance process, but it\u2019s not a proven thing. I failed 3 courses at before transferring and the grades replaced by taking those courses again. I had a 3.84 GPA, no research or extracurricular activities linked to the school. I was able to technically apply using the REPP pathway and the veterans pathway but they accepted me under the REPP. I explained all of my circumstances about failing classes and I did do volunteer work as well as tutoring at the library for free since I was often there to study and my ex girlfriend was a tutor that would get swamped with students and needed extra help so all the students got tutored. They offered me a student tutoring position while I was there but I turned it down because I did to help not for money and if it became a job I wouldn\u2019t like doing it as much. I mentioned all this on my application as well as making several drafts for the application essays and having several people look through them to make sure they were top notch. I don\u2019t think my application was anything special, but I think your essays do matter a good bit because it\u2019s not just academic standing they are looking for. They want to make sure you are a good fit for GA Tech morally and ethically. As well as having drive and aspirations. You may have been waitlisted but don\u2019t give up!",

I am trying to get an idea of my financial situation, and have created a preliminary budget. \n\nI'll be making about $2600 a month after taxes, and the apartments I have looked at (1br) range from \\~1350-1450 a month. \n\nThe part I could use help on are the extra monthly fees that most apartments dont tell you until you apply. Specifically things like electricity, water, and gas usage. I know these depend on how much you actually use, but I am just trying to get a rough idea. Currently I have budgeted about $150/month for these costs. Is this reasonable ?\n\nAs a reference, In my current apartment I use about \\~200 kWh per month (for electricity). \n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqsdb186zylc1.png?width=605&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2414588893825434d05e599e7a7f80ac3f869b3",

However, with a 2.2K per month stipend, I still managed to save a lot and ended up buying a PS5, a gaming PC, and a new phone last year; rent will increase so will my stipend.

I originally submitted it on February 18th. Since then, I have called HireRight multiple times and was even able to reach their escalation team.\n\nAccording to the representatives I spoke to from HireRight, the consensus is that the criminal and court check for Fulton County is the cause of all the delays. Even though on March 15th, Fulton provided a new way for third party companies to complete their background check on ResearchGA. However, the HireRight representative noted that they could not use ResearchGA because it does not include all the information, or the information is not up to date. They also claimed that their professionals were working on it. Some in this post have suggested that re-submitting a background check would make it go faster, but the HireRight representatives were not sure if this was a good idea.\n\nMoreover, any deadlines or dates that they have are completely arbitrary and not able to be trusted. We also called Fulton County, and they say that they never provide deadlines or ETAs. As a result, please take whatever dates HireRight gives you with a massive grain of salt.\n\nAs for the actual solution to this problem, I reached out to my company's team responsible for background checks, and they provided me with an attestation. An attestation just says that you do not have any criminal actions on your record. After filling this out, my company would allow me to continue the onboarding process.\n\nI would highly encourage everyone to reach out to their recruiters and hiring managers immediately, explaining the situation. Most HR departments should already be aware of the situation with Fulton County and will be ready to help you. Continuing communication with your hiring company is key in this situation.",

Here\u2019s my full timeline below:\n\nMar 27 - I sent the email to company &amp; HireRight and called HireRight\n\nMar 28 - I received the additional form &amp; submitted\n\nMar 31 - Portal updated with a comment from HireRight team that listed form as \u201cforwarded to State Police\u201d\n\nApril 2 - Background check completed by State of GA police\n\n-~-~-~-~-~-~-\n\nHi all - hopefully this is helpful for some. My process is not closed yet - and if it continues to delay, I will ask my HR rep about an Attestation form like @economy-leading5544 suggested. Or - if it wraps up and completes, I\u2019ll provide an update here. \n\nHere is the email I sent to my company\u2019s HR rep WITH the hire right service email on CC. Immediately after sending, I called the hire right help number (waited on hold for forever) and walked them (verbatim) through the email to force action. The HireRight rep didn\u2019t know what I was talking about (even though shouldn\u2019t they be the ones notifying me of this??) - so I had them click the article, asked them if they read it in totality, etc. \n\nThere\u2019s now a note on my check in hireright that says my request was \u201cescalated.\u201d Shortly after I received the form others have mentioned about signing off for a state-level background check. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nHere\u2019s my email:\n\nSubject: Fulton County Issue &amp; Remediation - Re: Congratulations on your offer! \n\nHi [HR REP NAME], \n\n01. BACKGROUND\n\nHope you are doing well! As I'm incredibly excited to get started - I've been monitoring the progress of my background check. \n\nAccording to the HireRight portal, it looks like it is ##% complete - with the main variable not yet complete being my Atlanta (Fulton County) criminal &amp; offense record. While all other cities seemed to clear within a day or two of the request, this one is still pending so I decided to look into it a bit. \n\n\n02. Issue - TLDR\n\nIt appears that &lt;[Fulton County experienced a cybersecurity incident early this year](https://www.fultoncountyga.gov/news/2024/03/15/fulton-county-incident-response-update-for-march-15-2024)&gt; that has affected their ability to provide this information through county requests. (Source: fultoncountga.gov).\n\nNaturally, as one does, I ended up on a &lt;[Reddit forum about this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1b4twfr/anyone_else_waiting_for_hireright_background_check/)&gt; where many others were experiencing (and are still experiencing) the same issue. (Source: reddit r/gatech).\n\n\n03. Solution - TLDR\n\nHowever, both the forum and the official state communication have provided a solution saying that:\n\"Third-Party Background Checks\nThird-party background checks completed by accessing court records were affected by the outage. Those checks can now be completed following the transition to a new record search site. Companies conducting third party searches should now access records through re:SearchGA at https://researchga.tylerhost.net/\"\n\n\n04. My Quick Ask\n\nWould you be able to look into this for me and confer with the HireRight team that they use the state-recommended site to access records in order to expedite the process of my background check? \n\nThanks in advance for any help you may be able to provide!",

If any of you saw a post I made earlier this week about a housing dilemma I had (ended up deleting it because I thought it was too niche of an issue), I got it resolved!\n\nAnyway, my actual post is about y'alls experience living in some of the on-campus apartments. My friends and I are rising 2nd years and are hoping to get into Crecine, but we wanted to have some backup options in case that doesn't happen. I currently live in NAV North (accoms), which has definitely been something (if you live here you already know LOL). Despite that, I do like the convenience of the dining hall being right there, and also having laundry.\n\nIf any of y'all have lived in the following apartments, please feel free to share what your experience was like! Just want ideas on which buildings to prioritize for backups.\n\n* NAV South, East\n* Crecine (#1 choice)\n* Zbar\n* GLC (since it's apparently for undergrads now?)\n* 8th Street\n* Center Street\n* Nelson-Shell\n* Maulding",

Shower was fine though\n\n- AC/Heating was very old meaning that you can't set it to a specific temperature, so it would keep running until you manually turned it off, no matter how hot or cold it got.",

It makes it a pain in the ass if two people are cooking bc you have to do the weird squeeze behind thing, but in terms of everything else it's a solid building. I've heard decent things about Eighth and Z-Bar. Apparently Nelson Shell had roaches at one point? Could be hearsay.",

I do really like how NAV has two parking garages, can anyone attest to the parking experience on West?",

The interviews can even be designed to target specific skills that they need practice with.\n\nThe value for candidates is to help calm their nerves, build confidence and be prepared with answers for a comprehensive set of evaluation skills.  \nThe app is called RightJoin- [rightjoin.co](https://rightjoin.co/)\n\nIf anyone is in the job market and have interviews coming up, and you want to test my app for free, please DM me for the discount code. i would love and really appreciate some honest feedback from the gt community here.",

There were several supply chain issues that slowed this down.\n\n* We are also expecting 4 more treadmills to arrive any day now to help alleviate some of the broken ones.\n\n* Peter's parking deck is open. We are still process-improving on how things work out there. We've gotten great feedback thus far.\n\n* Ken Byers will have inconsistent hours now that NCAA tennis is in season. It is important to check the GTAA schedule before showing up for open play. \n\nAs always you can message me or reply to this thread - I do my best to reply here.\n\nIf you have any questions about our operations or other general CRC questions, please email us or visit our [website](https://www.crc.gatech.edu/).

So, for example, if you chose the Intelligence (AI) thread, you\u2019ll have to take your generic CS prerequisites and various general Ed. classes but then you get to take a handful of classes specific to AI like Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, etc. they give you like 9 options and usually you\u2019re required to take like 3 of them. And you get to choose two of these threads. I believe Computer Engineering does this too. But yeah, so they\u2019re releasing (dropping) a new Cybersecurity thread, that\u2019ll basically allow you to take 3 of these classes pertaining to Cybersecurity. I\u2019m not sure if these classes are new, but yeah, that\u2019s basically what I mean. A few of these classes are like, \u201cMalware Reverse Engineering,\u201d and, \u201cCyberwarfare,\u201d which sound insanely interesting. I hope explanation makes sense.",

Coming on here for some advice and insights into off campus housing.\n\nI\u2019m a rising senior, and like hundreds of other students, I have been pushed off campus for the 24-25 school year. This leaves me exploring my off campus options. I\u2019m looking at apartments preferably near east side of campus, and something fairly affordable as well. I am a first generation student, and navigating this situation on my own has been kinda difficult\ud83d\ude05\n\nMy current options are Uhouse, 100 midtown, standard, and the here. I also would need a parking spot, so that must be taken into account. Based on my research, Uhouse is the most affordable option, but it apparently has majorly gone downhill in the past year or so based on other Reddit posts and google reviews. Is it really as bad as everyone says it is? Are my other options fairly decent? Just looking for insights from current or previous residents. Which option is the best for me? Also, are there any other options that I\u2019m not considering?\n\nThanks guys ",

Their office was so annoying and its practically impossible to contact someone when you need to, also their utilities are also so expensive. I remember paying like $80 one month when at uhouse the max i've paid is $11\n\nOut of all your options, here is probably the best if money is not a huge concern but if it is then uhouse isnt as bad as everyone makes it out to be (its just not as nice as the other apts)",

When do recruitment start, where should we register, what is the process (how long and any details I need to know), and are there any fees? How competitive is the process? How much are the dues (and additional ones) for each sorority, and do they work on per-semester basis? Once accepted, do we need to reregister for the next semester? Is it mandatory to attend every events and parties, and what are the requirements to maintain your membership? What are advantages and disadvantages of joining? How are the houses, as in the building and facilities? Does each member get their own bedroom and a shared bathroom? Also, any thoughts on joining a sorority as an introvert?",

                "body": "The links here will answer a lot of your questions. [https://www.gatechcpc.com/welcome](https://www.gatechcpc.com/welcome)\n\nSorority membership is not a social club that you register for a semester at a time. Once initiated you are expected to be a member for all your undergrad years. Greek organizations are regarded as membership for life; when you graduate you become an alum member.\n\nA sorority, or fraternity, is only as good as everyone participating and contributing. \n\nTo maintain your membership you need to stay current on your dues, participate in all required activities, and keep your grades up. Dues are billed each semester and you really can't opt out for a semester unless you aren't in school. Plus there is a meal plan and everyone takes their meals at the house and the meal plans are pretty good plus it's a great way to meet others and get comfortable as a new member. Participation is required for weekly meetings, philanthropic events, and most sisterhood events and socials unless you have a valid excuse.  Sorority membership is not really a drop in kind of thing, you need to be committed, but you will get far more out of it if you throw yourself into the opportunities.\n\nEach member does not live in the house, only about 1/3 - 1/2 the membership lives in plus exec officers are required. First years never live in the house. The rooms are a roommate situation, not singles, and there are common bathrooms for everyone on a floor.\n\nThe big advantage is friendship. You will not like everyone but most members find their group of close friends. That's what it's all about. Relationships in a Greek organization are really like a bell curve: you will love and be close with a small group, you will like and respect most of the other members to a certain degree, and there will be some that you really don't care for at all if not can't stand. But that's life. There will be members in your major and in your classes that you can study with, there will be members involved in clubs and orgs all over campus and can help you get involved too if you want. If you want leadership experience there are many offices you can run for, you will learn how to run a formal meeting efficiently (a great skill) and you will hopefully develop skills to get along with all kinds of personalities. You will also meet and make friends in other sororities and fraternities, as well as their friends who aren't in Greek life.\n\nIf you are an introvert you may find recruitment difficult. You need to hold up your end of a social conversation and show your best personality and appearance, and not just answer questions with short answers. Too many PNM's equate recruitment as an interview process but it's not at all, it's a process to find best fit. Each house has a slightly different vibe and a culture. Sororities are social organizations and social skills are important. After recruitment it is important to try to make friends in your new member class. Meetings and meals help with this, plus you can hang out at the house when you aren't in class. You don't have to be a gregarious person necessarily, but you might need to get out of your comfort zone at first and then it gets easier.",

The 8 NPC sororities actually really are far more alike than different, with around 175-200 members in each one. \n\nWhat anyone thinks of each group's vibe or culture or characteristics is completely dependent on their own personal lens, the individuals they happen to interact with, and the influence from other's personal opinions.  \n\nRecruitment is in person for a reason. The only way to get a feel for the different sororities is through meeting and talking to members.  This is why fall formal recruitment is the best time to consider joining because you get to meet some members in all houses at least once.\n\nYou also need to keep in mind that recruitment is a two-way process; the sororities will be making their own determination about the PMN's 'vibes' as well, and while you may decide you think you like the vibe of certain sororities best, those chapters may think that other PNM's are a better fit for them. In that case they would release you and you would need to focus on your other options. \n\nTLDR; you can't go through recruitment before you go through recruitment. Keep an open mind and don't think you can predetermine a certain house for yourself.",

Yes there are required things you go to each semester, but if you have serious conflicts (classes, jobs, etc.) most will try to work with you. Like you would expect anywhere, you'll be really close to a subset and maybe not know others as well. But the support I have felt from those I didn't realize knew my name has been incredible. From day 1 I had people offering to help me study, plan schedules for classes, and a group who would consistently bring me dinner across campus when I had evening classes just to make sure I would eat something. Greek life may not be a great fit for everyone, but if you're curious, take a look at the CPC guide, watch some of the GT sorority sisterhood videos on youtube, and rush. You can always back out of rush, COB at a later date, or join a chapter and then drop before initiation if it's not a right fit for you.",

Like seriously, you can't tell me tofu costs more than beef, I know how much they cost. Maybe these fake meat options should be replaced with protein like tofu or beans that aren't as expensive or something? Because just having vegetables as the only affordable option is ridiculous.

In terms of my experiences,\n\n1. Cooking so so valuable. You save money and you can start simple. If you have a pan, you can always make a run to Publix to get a lotta veggies (different colors), pasta, sauce and whip up your \"mostly homemade pasta\"\n\n2. In terms of protein, tofu has been a valuable asset. I personally am into making curries. An easy way could be to get some veggies, tofu, and thai curry paste (yellow, red, etc) and whip up a beautiful thai curry in minutes. You can enjoy with rice! Also, my roommate and I also like to make quesadillas with refried black beans, veggies, taco seasoning, taco sauce, some chilli powders, cheese and its also not as difficult if you put your mind to it\n\nThe point is that sometimes we gotta get a bit creative and realize that there are options if you actively try them out!\n\n3. In terms of food options if you dont have time to cook or unable to, below are a list of places that could work (according to my experience + vegetarian friends' experiences). Not exahustive by any means:\n\n* Chipotle\n* Rreal tacos\n* Lucky Buddha\n* Govindas Cafe (they deliver to campus if you join their whatsapp group. very affordable)\n* Food terminal\n* Mamouns Falafel\n* Gyro Bros\n* Sometimes there's this place called Marrakech Express that comes to campus to serve lunch. Price point and food really good\n*",

I wish they'd use those here rather than these more expensive alternatives.

It's disheartening for food truck owners to see the never ending line for Slutty Vegan while it takes an act of congress for students to look in your direction. \n\nSee the running theme? Actions speak louder than words and when people don't patronize XYZ, they're going to change the format to whatever people will patronize. \n\nThe Slutty Vegan situation is complicated so I'll leave it at this: their food truck was the MOST successful food truck to set foot on campus. Now that they're here permanently, everybody hates them. I don't get it.",

JJ is similar to others as they have no protein, it's still just vegetables. I like Subway because they have those patties and places like Panera have eggs, taco bell has beans, etc (for an affordable price too).\n\nAnd I totally get your point with Slutty Vegan. Maybe it's their good marketing (like wow there's a burger named sloppy toppy? That's crazy, I gotta check that out!) But now since we have it here permanently, I think it's easier to see that each burger is 20 dollars which trumps their brand. Honestly, I'm not sure how well Slutty Vegan is doing, I'm assuming not well because it burns through everyone's wallets, but I could be wrong. I'd be curious to know though.",

There are numerous vegetarian Caribbean, Indian, and Chinese places as well as vegan pizza and central/South American food in the city which isn't reflected in on campus options. I agree there should be something other than Slutty Vegan which is good but cost prohibitive and uninteresting to have regularly compared to the wealth of options for those without dietary restrictions",

I have a CS 1332 exam coming (midterm 2) and according to the prof this is the class where performances are the worst. 1332 has way too many practice resources and I can't use every one which ones would you guys recommend to succeed. I barely scraped an A on the first one so I want to maximize my chances of succeeding?",

Coding should be pretty straightforward but I remember exam 2 usually has one or two Tree-related coding questions that\u2019s not a direct HW method so just look at the past exams and you\u2019ll see patterns in the solutions to tree-based problems.\n\nSecond tip is to practice, practice, practice. Come up with a data structure and practice adding an element to it, removing an element, etc. Then check your work with CS Vistool. \n\nThe Big O questions were the hardest in my opinion, since they were the trickiest. Here the main tip I have is to write out the worst case time complexities for all operations of all data structures (e.g. adding to external chaining hashmap) and study that.",

However, getting only negative feedback with zero positive reinforcement isn\u2019t exactly balanced constructive criticism, and I\u2019d hope it\u2019s not the norm in the real world.\n\nFor example, we were meeting with a faculty member seeking advice on the valuation section of our report asking whether we should explain a high-level framework or be more granular and try to execute the valuation and produce numbers. She said that without fail, the examiners will be disappointed either way. You\u2019re damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be a baby, but I hope it\u2019s understandable that it\u2019s not super validating to do a project given unclear expectations and being told that no matter how hard you\u2019ll try, you\u2019ll always be a disappointment. It honestly makes me want to put in less effort since we\u2019ll be a disappointment either way. \n\nI\u2019d love to hear if alumni look back on Senior Design thinking it\u2019s more or less intense than the real world and if they felt they\u2019d actually learned applicable skills in this class ",

They want to be as harsh, but they're not as connected with the project and they don't have the time to add nuance and positive feedback. I was lucky because my team's advisor did a good job of meeting with us after the interim and translating the pure criticism into something constructive (if still harsh, we were objectively behind at that point).\n\nBecause of that, I personally had a great experience, but if you don't have a faculty member on your side like that, I'd say just keep you head down, take your passing grade, and get out.\n\ntldr:\n\nGood advisor: ignore the haters and have fun doing a cool project\n\nBad advisor: just get out",

Teams feel like the feedback is \"rating their performance\" while the faculty are just trying to give clear, candid feedback based on their experience in industry.\n\nIt can feel harsh, even brutal, but we would be doing a disservice to any students by not giving them clear feedback.\n\nGetting feedback that hurts to hear doesn't mean you aren't doing a great job!

If you get little to no feedback, that's when you should really be worried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, if you think you're going to get kinder feedback given in a way that's easier to hear in industry.. you won't.",

He didn't tell us how it was wrong or what could be fixed. We confirmed with our Accounting notes and the CFO of the client's company, and the formula was correct. I've also heard stories of ISYE faculty getting so angry that they storm out of the room during a presentation.

Great talent will only want to come to GT if they have a competitive program and a pro-style offense (with rare exceptions, GT has a tough time getting offensive skill positions into the league and it's usually just trenches guys).\n\nPaul Johnson did the best with what he had but we will continue to struggle as long as our Athletics department refuses to gets real and smart about their strategy to challenge UGA meaningfully.\n\nWe are a harder school than UGA - that is both a positive and negative. You can go farther in life with a degree from GT (on average) than a degree from UGA. So that should be an advantage when recruiting talent. BUT GT is hard and if a top talent is focused on playing college football and then going pro, then they don't (and probably shouldn't) focus on too much else other than football. Why would they put themselves through the stress of weed-out engineering classes when they could be racing cars after strip club visits in Athens?\n\nIdeally we would want to recruit athletes that are up for the challenge academically but also talented on the field. That unique subgroup of athletes typically make the best pro players anyway (professionalism, game IQ etc.). Stanford and Michigan are both academically challenging schools but are able to recruit well because they have a firm strategy on *who* to recruit.\n\nGT sells itself in terms of the quality of the degree, location, program history etc. It's in a big conference as well. The problem is our team doesn't have the vision or the belief that it can create a culture of high performing athletes that won't just get destroyed by UGA. It would take a big personality that comes from a culture of winning and understands the nuance and history of GT Football, that could create pull and get us up to the floor of talent necessary to challenge for a ranked spot consistently. One good hire can be the difference maker. I doubt we will see that though. The athletics department is too narrow-minded/focused on short term appointments, when, in reality, no one ever truly believes that we will win a CFB championship from year to year when in reality it should be totally possible.",

There is not such a thing as \"just\" an EE or BME; you specialize in sub-disciplines while working. Good on you for figuring this out now.\n\nEdit: I strongly recommend joining professional societies and going to company events if you want more exposure to engineering job options.

When I was learning data science, I did attend an online presentation and they went over the job titles for different roles (analyst, data scientist, data engineer, ML researcher, etc.) but it was still hard to understand the distinctions until I read lots of job postings, and I sent out multiple resumes for jobs with different titles that were not really matches (HR could probably tell right away). It takes time, and with the internet you can find lots of job postings and look at a few a day to get a better grasp on what responsibilities different positions entail - I highly recommend it, especially for current students!",

I like to go through each lecture, complete all the practice problems (at least twice), and go through any practice exams posted. I recite the major concepts of each topic to myself. I also make a list of my most commonly made mistakes and thinking patterns. However, I still end up sometimes missing the point of a question on an exam - either reading into it too deeply, misinterpreting it, or straight up forgetting a formula that I thought I had down. Does anyone have any tips on how to reform study habits?",

I find that actually struggling with the problem and trying to figure it out helps me with exam-problem-intuition\n\nI think a big part of studying is not necessarily about knowing what's in the lectures, but it's also about tying up loose ends and digesting the content fundamentally.",

In which case working the practice exams is quite valuable. Your question is a little different, but I think nevertheless talking with your professor about what you're doing, what works and what doesn't, will be the most productive route. I find that a 15 or 20 minute chat during office hours can go a long way to sharpen understanding in a way that would be super difficult to do on one's own. Good luck!",

Self-care in general is a really good idea before any high-stakes/high-pressure situation, and tests are no different.\n\nDuring the exam, force yourself to slow. down. Make a pact with yourself to read every question twice. For problem set type tests, commit to checking your answers once you get them. It's often possible to verify that the answer you got is reasonable; this will let you catch misinterpreting the question. Practice these behaviors with the practice exams.\n\nWhen you take the practice exams, do you do a mock test? Give yourself a time limit, and the same resources available for the real exam? It is very easy to think \"oh, I've got this\" after flipping through a practice exam with the answers written out. But it sounds like your issues are more with \"how to test\" than with the core material; reading the answer key isn't helpful for those problems but practicing taking the test is!",

However, I'm uncertain if this is something I want to commit to 100%, considering I might want to change professions in the future or focus on a different area.\n\nIf I decide that I no longer want to pursue this field, would it be acceptable or professionally ethical to resign or not return after a semester? The employment is not binding. I'm genuinely excited about this career opportunity, and it seems interesting, but I'm very unsure whether I will enjoy it or want to shift my focus.\n\nAdditionally, it's at GTRI, so would leaving have any effect on my opportunities at GT?

If you decide you don\u2019t want to return to the same position, just tell them you very much like GTRI but are interested in [insert discipline] and interested in other opportunities within GTRI to pursue that. If you demonstrate that you\u2019re smart and motivated, your manager could be a reference to another position within GTRI. \n\nTechnology careers are more fluid than you may think in terms of disciplines. I started as a software engineer but have also run lead the cybersecurity programs for a start up, managed IT/help desk, been a business analyst, project manager, lead infrastructure and devops teams, and more. Knowing how all the different disciplines work together can help you architect better solutions and better build and organize teams.",

My post got a looooot of attention like it became one of the most popular posts on there \ud83e\udee8 so my now boyfriend didn\u2019t bother approaching me\n\nBut it also hit him at 2 am when I got an Instagram DM from him randomly\n\nHis line was \u201cI heard you like anime, wanna be friends? \ud83d\ude05\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 we laugh at it together now\n\nI had a boyfriend at that time and of course, we didn\u2019t know each other irl so all that came out of it was him sending me random reels that were not my humor or interest \ud83e\udd2a\n\nWe were totally online our first year. When we finally got to campus sophomore year, we met up the second day of moving in (still before classes) and he introduced me to a group of people he knew that is now our friend group that has amassed about 30 people from GT :D and we\u2019re all close\n\nHe found out that I was single and then he started to get flirtier (? LOL idk what was happening it was a blur) for two weeks\n\nAnd then he confessed to me at the CRC (which was set up by our friends) he started the conversation off by asking me relationship questions \ud83e\udee3 and then asked if I know who he liked\n\nAnd then he pulled out his phone and it was our DM\u2019s HAHA so cute \ud83e\udd79\ud83e\udd79\n\nand we are still together now and he sends me cute reels of animals and calls me a rat\n\nTL;DR: shoot your shot :)",

We met through Pride Alliance plus a hazmat emergency.\n\nThis was back in 2010, so I don't know if they still do this, but at the time Pride Alliance did a group lunch every Tuesday. We'd both attended that irregularly, but hadn't interacted.\n\nOne day, I was between classes and walking through campus when I saw a massive collection of emergency vehicles. I found out later there'd been a silane gas leak in one of the labs. Anyway, I had time to kill, so I was just standing there watching the spectacle. This guy walked by on the sidewalk, and we realized we recognized each other from Pride lunches, so we said hi and started chatting. He was a transfer student and was feeling gloomy about doing badly in classes and possibly needing to drop one. I reassured him this was normal at Tech and dropping a class doesn't mean you're a failure. We had a nice chat for 15 minutes or so and then parted ways.\n\nSoon after, he realized we might never meet again, so he tracked me down through mutual friends in Pride Alliance, we exchanged messages, and arranged a date. The story goes on, but TLDR we've been together 14 years and finally tied the knot a few years ago.",

Instantly attracted. Didn't do anything, though, and moved on with my life.\n\nFast forward to end of fall semester 2005, and instead of studying I decide to trawl Facebook (still TheFacebook at the time). Found out that this girl also happened to know another friend of mine from classes freshman year. I asked said friend to introduce us. She agreed and held a party right after finals at her apartment in 6th Street. F and I met, found out we lived in Woodruff North together. We chatted every now and again, and in May 2006 after finals F's roommate asked F for some alone time with her then-boyfriend (a uga grad, ugh). So F and I got to hang out for a bit.\n\nWe went on our first date the summer of 2006. It went well, we did an impromptu extension, ended up having some chemistry. Went on a second date and met her younger sister and her now-husband (that was quick). I thought things were getting serious. So I tried to determine the relationship (does that term still exist?). F said she doesn't want to be in a serious relationship because she just got out of a long one with a not-so-great guy. Well shit.\n\nBut I wouldn't take no for an answer! Fall 2006 started, and we continue casual dating. It slowly gets more and more serious, and in fall 2007 I lavaliere her. We graduate December 2008, and for Christmas we get engaged. Finally got married in 2012, and now we're working on raising the next generation of Tech grads.\n\nEven if it's a remote opportunity, pursue those opportunities!",

Here\u2019s some of the pros and cons I can think of off the top of my head\n\nPros:\n- In state tuition (if you\u2019re out of state) (no additional out of state fees like you would see if you do undergrad)\n- cost of living (rent particularly) is cheaper\n- smaller classes so you get to know your professors well\n- you get to go abroad (they only do classes M-R so you can take long weekends to travel)\n- registration (particularly first semester) is WORLDS less stressful than your first semester as a MS student on Atlanta campus. Classes rarely fill up at GT-E compared to the madhouse that is ATL Phase-2 registration\n- Applying to BS/MS on GTE campus gets you a much faster acceptance than the ATL campus (~2-4 weeks vs ~2-4 months depending on when you apply) and is pretty much a guaranteed acceptance as long as you meet GPA requirements- I\u2019ve heard rumblings that this is no longer the case for ATL campus applications but haven\u2019t confirmed\u2026\n\nCons:\n- Course selection can be a bit slim but they have it posted on their website ahead of time so you can see if they offer stuff you\u2019re interested\n- (pro tip on the class registration: if you see an online class taught in the online campus/shenzen campus you can probably convince them to give you a waiver to take that class)\n- long time away from home\n- language barrier can be a bit rough when dealing with administrative stuff (getting housing, a visa, etc) but once you\u2019re in the city people are very nice and accommodating if you make an attempt to speak French. \n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s more I am missing, so ask me any questions- I can see what advice I can give. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s a great experience I would say. Though it is dependent on how social you are willing to be. I went with friends from undergrad, so that helped me a lot. If you do the BSMS program, you only have to stay there for one semester (obvs you could do it your whole time there too if you like). If you do it through just a plain MS you would have to spend 2 semesters there. Great opportunity to travel and see loads of Europe. Would recommend if studying abroad has been something of interest.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nI was offered the Talent Initiative Transfer Pathway Program for gatech for Fall of 2025. I've got the gist of what the program is understood, but I just wanted to ask here on this subreddit on what other people's experiences were? Is there some catch to the program, or something I should look out for? I just wanted to know what exactly i'm getting myself into before I start to pick courses that would transfer to gatech at my other school. \n\nFor some background, I'm OOS, and am planning to major in Aerospace Engineering, which gatech is world renowned for. During application season, gatech was my dream school, and some place that I really wanted to go to, but knew it would be hard for me because of me being OOS. I'm sort of adamant on attending gatech now that I have a garunteed chance (as long as I dont slack off my first year), so I really wanted to know about some personal experiences on the program. \n\ntldr: is transferring in through the talent initiative transfer pathway program worth it?

I\u2019ve heard (and seen from historical data) he mainly gives out As and Bs and the occasional C, so my logic right now is just power through the class so I don\u2019t have to delay graduation, hope for a passing grade, and just move on. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have much academic advice since I\u2019m struggling too and pretty much checked out of the class, but maybe your husband can find comfort knowing others are in his same position\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

The prof basically said that the only people that are struggling are the ones who don\u2019t major in the type of work that class gives so he\u2019s not changing for them.",

Equipment is expensive, editing takes time, and you're valuable :)!\n\nEdit: as this event is tmmrw, you won't be able to rent a library camera in time... But def would recommend for future events.",

        "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a former employee at GATech, who filed an HR report on the EthicsPoint system in accordance to the university policy about unethical advisor behavior. In the very beginning of the process after I filed, they told me that, even before any investigative action is taken, and even if I choose to withdraw now:\n\nA) My confidential report will be made into public record, as per the Georgia Open Records act.  \nB) The person I am alleging advisor abuse against, will be notified of the information.\n\nI was told that this would happen independent of any choice I make now including to withdraw the complaint, even though the case has not yet begun beyond them contacting me and having a short Microsoft Teams meeting with me / receiving my complaint.  The EthicsPoint site I submitted the report to said that the information would be \"confidential\" (source: Ethicspoint Navex terms and conditions). This seems to be directly violated by A, B given that I cannot withdraw according to the HR employee I spoke to, and no where in their terms and conditions or their website was this clearly indicated.\n\nA and B combined means that sensitive personal details of my complaint will be unmasked to the person I am complaining against, which includes information about people who can corroborate my story, who I would prefer not be known to the complainee due to retaliation potential.  There is also personal information that I would prefer not be made public (although if it is, the world doesn't end for me).\n\nI have already considered seeking legal advice, and may pursue it if there are no further options at the university. I aware of the 50-18-72 carveout of the Georgia Open Records act.  I do not believe i was informed about the Open Records Act prior to filing a report that was called \"confidential\", nor was I informed that I would have no way to stop the process and no way to prevent the complainee to be informed even if I wanted to back out of the process.\n\nI was wondering if there was any advice besides for seeking legal representation, to prevent the publication of highly sensitive personal information about witnesses and more.   I am looking into legal representation, and look forward to a chance to exercise my rights.\n\nPS: I am happy speaking to anyone of the details of the case, including my name and information about the case (and the complainee), in private message.",

Plus they tack on some nebulous 65/mo \"amenity fee\" which I have no idea what it covers and they force you to pay like 40/mo for \"valet trash\" that's picked up once a week. Your base rent might be cheap but even before adding power and water that's already like 100/mo in just bullshit fees.\n\nI'm beginning to think shitty leasing offices are sort of normal in this area though unfortunately, can't find any apartments that don't have people who will say the same about theirs.",

Our group members didn't pull their weight, I was the only one coming to class and actually on the same page with the demands of the project, and I was at home trying to take care of my dad who had a stroke and has now been recommended to a neurologist - I was noticing issues at the time, but was focused on finishing school and he had no healthcare.\n\nI find it interesting, and laughable, that at the end of the semester my professor told me to go to the communications center to learn better communication skills after I spent the whole semester hounding her and the TA because my group members weren't pulling their weight and they (the instructors) weren't doing anything pragmatic to intervene properly or promising that my group's lack of contribution or preparedness wouldn't affect my grade.\n\nBut now each of my EOY reviews at my fully remote job software engineering job, which takes into account multiple opinions from seniors on other teams,  highlights my communication skills as one of my strongest suits that led to my success.\n\nI never went to the communications center because I knew I wasn't the problem and had just been sent to my breaking point with the lack of quality contributions being made by my teammates, which actually caused one of my other teammates to drop the course.\n\nJust goes to show you how inadequate one person's opinion can be in assessing your actual abilities.",

Only in mass layoffs after they've succumbed to lifestyle creep do a lot of people really start to understand how fucked up life can get, or if they get some sort of chronic illness themselves. A lot of people need a reality check like this to happen. I just happened to have that reality check happen over and over again during my climb up the academic ladder that is GT and trying to find a job after graduation.\n\nExpecting people who are in positions of privilege like that to show an ounce of compassion for someone navigating a situation that most would struggle with turns out to be a really big ask.

It is worrying to see a student 2 years later hung up about a stray comment, naming a female professor directly and without a title, and then talking as if this professor knows nothing/do nothing/need to be taken down a peg. It reads exactly like faculty training materials on disgruntled male students prone to disrespect/violence. It is completely within the realm of reason that they way you were speaking to the instructional team/the frequency of expected individual attention may have motivated the comments to work on this.

It can destroy organizations from the inside out. Smart individuals step in when they see lazy work leading to negative impacts, and for someone to be an instructor and not have the ability or thoughtfulness to step in to a situation where negative work is being directly addressed by a student ( or at least squelch their worries about it affecting their grade ) that is a huge issue.\n\nWhen you experience that level of apathy, you might hold onto it as well.\n\nEdited the post to leave out her name since it's so concerning to you.",

        "selftext": "I'm thrilled to share that I've been accepted into Georgia Tech's Physics Graduate Program! Along with the acceptance, I've been offered a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) position with an annual stipend of approximately $35k. \n\nAs this is a significant step in my academic journey, I want to make informed decisions moving forward. I'm reaching out to this community for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. Is a $35k/year stipend in line with what's typically offered for Physics GTA positions at GT (or similar institutions)? I want to ensure this offer is competitive and fair.\n\n2. Does anyone have experience or advice on negotiating GTA stipends? Is it common or even advisable to try to negotiate this aspect of a graduate offer?\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",

For reference, the highest is ISyE, BME, and one of the CS schools that pay up to 40K. \n\nBut to answer your questions, it's a very competitive offer at least based on the price levels of Atlanta and you can already get a really nice apartment. And no, I don't think you can negotiate your stipend, and Ph.D. programs do not work that way (I assume you are not from the US in this case).",

Some of those lists have many people on them (undergrad, male) while others have very few (grad, GIH). So, it's possible that someone who filled out the form at 1:30pm might have a relatively low position number, if they are on one of the shorter lists.\n\nHOWEVER, that does not mean they have a better chance at getting off their waitlist. People will be offered a space as it becomes available for their classification and gender. If a space can be used for multiple classifications/genders, the original survey timestamp order will be used to fill the space.",

In general, the number of spaces allocated for the different classifications is pre-determined and primarily driven by demand. So, the longer lists have more people, but they also have more beds allocated to them, and vice versa. Ultimately, it depends on how things like cancellations play out over the next few months, so I cannot predict either way, but the person in your scenario might see a slight improvement or they might see the opposite. It should not be meaningful in either direction though, and we'll be monitoring the velocity of each list closely to make sure that is the case. Therefore, I would recommend that person stays on whichever list would potentially provide them the most comfortable living arrangement if they were to get off the waitlist. (Instead of switching for a perceived advantage or in an attempt to game the system.)",

There's also the Waitlist Priority Consideration [form](https://housing.gatech.edu/applicants/faqs#WhatisWaitlistPriorityConsiderationandhowdoesitwork), which I think opens in March but you won't be given priority until July which makes no sense but it's better than nothing if you need on-campus housing for financial reasons, disability, or other factors.\n\nThe most important thing is making sure that you have a worst-case scenario that you can be okay with. If you are waiting for on-campus housing, you need to have a plan for what you'll do if you don't get it since this will allow you not to worry as much and to make sure you have somewhere to live. These worst-case scenarios can be:\n\n* Commuting if that's an option for you\n* Living in an unfurnished apartment that isn't a \"student apartment\", you can get good rates if living with at least one roommate and you can live there until you graduate and you can sign a lease in July or August if needed\n* Finding somewhere last minute to live with people you might not know which will likely be in Home Park or farther from campus (the [GT Housing Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GeorgiaTechSubleasesRoommates/) is a good place for this)\n* Signing somewhere off-campus and trying to find someone to sublease if you get on-campus housing (finding a sublease isn't guaranteed though)\n* Subleasing from someone only for the Fall and trying to get on-campus housing again in the Spring (it'll open in October) since you basically can't get back on-campus once you live off campus unless you live on-campus again only in the Spring\n\nWhile none of these are ideal, it's likely that you'll get off the waitlist and you have options if you don't, so just make sure that you have a solid backup plan so you that don't have to worry while waiting for the waitlist. Good luck :)",

To add to that, the class can put you behind in your course schedule due to pre reqs.\n\nYour probably going to have to take useless classes at some point in GT (humanities, English, social sciences, etc).

Join the waitlist or DM me if you're a curator or if you've ever thought about content curation. You can make lists like [https://www.curatelists.xyz/explore](https://www.curatelists.xyz/explore) in less than a few minutes.\n\nWe're currently in alpha, so would love some more early adopters.

                "body": "Interesting idea. I'd pose it as a generalized \"playlist\" creator rather than \"content curation platform\" which is a clunky mouthful. You call it \"curate lists\" but who cares about \"curation\" - anyone who likes things should be able to use the tool, regardless of whether they view themselves as a \"curator\" or not. And most people don't.\n\nI guess your idea is to approve curators first, but then you have the issue of trusting your curators as tastemakers. It doesn't make sense. Lists that are \"curated\" by your network aren't a draw to your platform. If I were you, I'd open it up to everyone, but I'd also create lists based off of established, public lists. Barack Obama publishes his list of books every year - use that, and you don't have to get Obama to DM you to have him as a curator. Same goes for many artists who publicly list their influences. Start there, build a userbase, then reach out directly to tastemakers who already have a platform.\n\nThere's a huge friction issue with waitlists. If someone's interested, you're turning a user away, and they probably won't come back. If you're truly in an alpha, let people sign up and figure it out. The more data the better. You're not taking money.\n\nAs for the tech, this is entirely on the frontend and very slow. If you click on \"explore,\" you have a flash of \"no trending list found\" before it finally loads all the data. You're leaking your firebase SDK info. Your lighthouse performance score is abysmal, and I could absolutely feel it on first load of even your homepage. If you want to stick to React, highly recommend Remix or Astro, but even Next.js will give you a huge performance boost at this stage.",

This is definitely very useful, and I encourage people to take a look at what you posted.\n\nHowever, the group I'm making is not exclusively the discussion aspect. To be clear, I'm not claiming that this is a substitute for therapy, or pretend that I know a lot about psychology. But gathering people with similar experiences can't possibly hurt.\n\nThe main differences are that there will be a social aspect. I was thinking about organizing things like campfires, challenges, trips, mini-debates, and all kinds of social events.\n\nAlso, on the more philosophical side, I feel like anxiety and loneliness are increasingly common, and it's all nice that we have facilities to handle mental health on the campus, but many communities don't. Part of running this experiment is to see how making a local group like this can be helpful, and to create a model that could be replicated in communities all over the place. \n\nSome of the more philosophical aims of this are: A. encourage people who are resistant to go to therapy, as many people have inner stigma and shame for going to therapy, B. provide an alternative for people who don't have resources to go to therapy, C. relieve therapists in an ever-increasing mental health epidemic. The best treatment for anxiety is really exposure to what you're afraid of, and a lot of people simply need encouragement and accountability for going beyond their comfort zone; there is no need for psychological expertise for the exposure aspect alone, and exposure by itself is incredibly powerful.",

I don't see how I'm playing a psychologist, because a lot of exposure therapy is also what parents, family, and friends are for. You don't need therapists just to get a net of people who will encourage you to grow as a person. An example from parenting: a child wants to approach other children and play but is afraid, the parent encourages them to go play; an example from friendships: a guy wants to ask out a girl he likes but is afraid, a good friend has their back and encourages them to do it.\n\nThe purpose of this club is to encourage people to try to expose themselves to the things they *want* to experience but are afraid of, step by step. This cannot possibly hurt because people are specifically pursuing things they want to achieve, but didn't have the necessary encouragement. It's goal driven; it's not meant to be a program to eliminate anxiety altogether because it is not clear to me how to do that. But it is true that exposure makes a person braver, and shows a person that they can do more than the thought they can.\n\nOf course, exposing oneself to their frights too radically can be more regressive than helpful. That's why it's important that it is *voluntary* exposure after all, and done in thoughtful moderation. There is no need to have a masters degree here. Besides, I'm not planning to be some kind of \"psychological leader\" more than just an organizer of events where people can try to figure things out on their own. If it makes you happy, I will make people sign waivers that this is not substitute for professional therapy, and that they should enter this club with no expectations. Cheers.",

What exactly happened, without revealing personal details?\n\nI can see instances where people are peer pressured to do something they aren't fully comfortable facing yet. I can see how people might be taking too large of leaps, which can definitely hurt. I can see how someone not being fully honest with the person, and just spreading false/empty encouragement without any substance can be harmful. These are to me obvious things that need to be clearly stated. First and foremost, *voluntary* exposure *in moderation* to the things we *want* to experience, with *true* encouragement by someone who's willing to be *honest* with the person, and won't *pressure* them to do it. What else could go wrong if these things are under control?",

I understand where you're coming from. Being there for your friends and family and being supportive is a hell of a lot different from a formal \"let's go face our anxiety!\" club.\n  \nBut to the point... the list of things that have gone wrong and how people have gotten hurt...\n\n- Person had anxiety about going into work because a coworker was bullying them. Person was encouraged to \"face their fear\" and stand up for themselves. Person did not do any role playing or do anything to build up to the level of anxiety they would feel by facing their bully. Person had a panic attack in the break room and ended up in the ER, was fired shortly after for \"unrelated\" performance issues. Person has not been able to find full-time work since and their anxiety has only worsened despite now being in treatment.\n- Person with fear of heights was encouraged to go to higher and higher locations. Person never tried to tolerate their distress, just go and do it and leave. Person ended up being anxious about leaving the ground floor until they entered treatment.\n- Person had anxiety about throwing things away (not trash/hoarding). Person was encouraged to have someone go through things with them for support. Instead of learning to tolerate the anxiety, person became completely dependent on having others make decisions for them until they entered treatment.\n\nShould I go on?\n\nIf you don't have a clinical understanding of what is going on, you're at a risk of providing the wrong kind of encouragement, taking too big a step, becoming an enabler. You don't know what that person needs, and *they* don't know what they need--because neither of you are clinicians.\n\nYeah, most of the time you'll be alright. But you won't know that you've entered a danger zone until after it happens.",

        "selftext": "Hey Jackets, I was recently admitted into the AE PhD program at Georgia Tech. GT is my dream school but I want to ask some questions about some reservations that I have about going to Tech.\n\n1. I've heard the culture at Tech is pretty cutthroat. Is that true? I attended a small liberal arts university for my undergrad and I really enjoyed the collaborative environment there, and I'm worried about going to a school that's a lot bigger and that has a reputation like Tech does. I don't back down from academic challenge (because I'm pursuing a PhD!) but I also don't want to feel like I'm doing it alone.\n2. I have heard the qualifying exam pass rate is 50% and that it is brutal even compared to quals at other top AE programs. Is this accurate?\n3. How is the housing situation for grad students? When should I start searching for apartments if I want to begin leasing in August? Any areas that grad students tend to live - and conversely, any areas to avoid like the plague?\n\nThanks so much!!! I'm so excited",

I feel that PhD students are quite insulated from the overall \u201cschool\u201d culture per se, and it\u2019s really more your program/cohort/lab that defines the environment you\u2019ll be working in. So like my cohort in ChBE was quite welcoming/cooperative, but best to talk to someone in AE\n\n2. Talk to someone in AE\n\n3. Housing is pretty much going to be all off-campus as you might expect (though there are on-campus options too). I think timewise you could start looking anytime now through early spring, though definitely don\u2019t have to sign anything this soon (although if that would put your mind at ease then thats fair enough). \n\nA lot of people I know live in Midtown, Home Park, Atlantic Station, or further out, but that depends on your budget/transportation situation/willingness to travel. Home Park is pretty cheap but is your more typical run-down college houses kinda thing; apartments in midtown are close but can get expensive; stuff like that. \n\nNo particular notes on where to avoid as I don\u2019t have much experience with other areas but midtown/home park/atlantic station are all decent. Worthwhile looking around at apartment reviews and other posts on this sub about housing as well",

Each lab is different though so while I didnt experience many of these issues ymmv depending on the lab. No matter the program you choose you will feel like you are going at it alone at some point. I have friends that went to different programs and they too had phases of their program that were difficult and deeply lonely.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n2. The AE program is known for having the hardest quals in the university. However the pass rate accounting for both tries is anywhere from 70-90% depending on the cohort from what I was told and observed\u00a0\n\n\n3. Housing can be tough. See if you can connect with other students coming into the lab/department for roommates and you will be fine. Start looking in March/April to get the lay of the land but a lot of apartments have 60 notice periods so they won't post apartments open for August move in until May/June.\u00a0",

Question 2 is for you to ask someone in the AE program although my roommates can attest to that brutality LMAO (they are 5th year doctoral candidates in AE program). \n\nFor question 1, if you are coming from a LAC (I assume LAC as in like Williams, Amherst, Swarthmore, etc.), expect a cultural shift. GT Ph.D. students are more or less insulated from the rest of the school (by the rest of the school, I mean undergraduates and masters) UNLESS you are a GTA, where you have to interact with non-doctoral students. \n\nYes, there's a collaborative culture, but DO NOT EXPECT your peers to be extremely well-rounded with regard to other aspects (I myself went to a LAC and GT was more academic-focused). After all, you are here to do research, research, and research (with caveats). \n\nWhether you are doing a ph.d. in aerospace or any program, this is GT and learn to be persistent FIRST before you come here in the Fall (or else, you won't like it when the reality hits you). And sadly, loneliness is also real and that's something I and my peers across different programs suffer; but this is not unique to GT. \n\nFor question 3, I don't know about your stipend situation, but look for apartments near school (someone else mentioned Midtown and Homepark already) and I am saying this from my personal experience; in my first year, I lived like 60-90 min commute using MARTA bus and trains, and it crushed my mental health (and to this day, I am still recovering because while the location is safe since it's a recently gentrified area, it was too isolated). Fun fact, I once saw a guy rolling weed, casually putting down his pistol and a broken HP monitor during summer on MARTA.\n\nNevertheless, I do enjoy my life here and I would not trade anywhere even though I trash GT occasionally because that's my beer time conversation (ok maybe except for 1-2 other schools).",

                "body": "I am a PhD student in one of the big AE labs. To address the questions:\n\n1. The grad community is not cutthroat at all. Many people mature in high school, and almost all mature in undergrad. The most cutthroat you'll find is the few bootlickers who will openly argue to the AE faculty that the PhD stipends should *not* be raised (despite being the lowest stipends at GT). Academically, the community here is delightful, especially if you are taking classes with your labmates.\n\n2. The AE quals are archaic and systemically disadvantage students from smaller labs. The big labs (ASDL, SSDL) pair you with senior students to ensure you are prepared for quals and have banks of previous years' questions for study material. Smaller labs don't have that. The quals are challenging, and you'll lose 6-12 months of research output studying for them, but they are doable. The previously mentioned bootlickers defend the AE quals because they gatekeep \"personalities\" that aren't suited for an AE PhD.\n\n3. There is a housing group on Facebook that is popular.\n\nBeyond your questions, I strongly recommend that you reconsider GT AE. The department has a strong reputation, however seriously lags behind other departments, especially in the post-Covid world. GT AE ranks dead last in PhD stipend relative to cost of living for the top 10 AE PhD programs in the US, even behind other GT departments (CS, IC pay $3,200/mo, BME pays even more, AE pays $2,500/mo).\n\nThe AE faculty are stuck in the belief that a PhD is supposed to be 5 years of indentured servitude with just-above-poverty pay and absurdly challenging quals that accomplish little beyond inequitably weeding out students (I know multiple students who were told they should have failed quals but passed because their advisor is so and so). That romance for the \"good old days\" is purely exploitative and is simply not today's reality. Competition for PhD programs is so intense that most admits already have MS degrees and/or work experience. PhD students aren't vulnerable 22-26 year olds anymore, but 25-30 year olds. GT AE still thinks they can get away with paying barely anything for high research output, while virtually every other comparable university (including other departments at GT) has moved on and left GT AE behind. This also doesn't consider that GT's student fees (which also apply to grad students, no matter their coursework status) are among the highest among comparable universities. Around 10% of your salary goes to having the opportunity to be paid minimum wage.\n\nIf you have any choice, I highly recommend choosing another program. I know GT is your dream school, but please, please take this advice seriously. The GT brand is not worth what AE has done to take advantage of its PhD students, and from the recent conversations between AE's GSA and the faculty, has full intention to continue doing.",

However, understand that much of the challenge comes from within, from traits that are inherent in you and the reason you were accepted in the first place. Because you have what it takes to make it!\n\nWhat does this mean? If you choose to attend; it will be incredibly stressful. You will feel the imposter syndrome. You will strongly consider quitting, and your reasons will be valid. Your grades will be lower than ever before. And very likely, you will eventually have a mental breakdown (often within the first year).  None of this is meant to imply that \"you are incapable or lesser\" in any way. But setting these expectations in advance will help you to perservere when you are at your lowest. Because if you already got admitted, you can do it!  It's up to you to not give up; that is the final test.\n\nAs for housing; i've heard that Home Park (the area on the immediate north side of campus) is well known for robberies. But it is so close, and affordable, that it is a popular place for students. If you can afford a little more, i know many people that live on the east side of campus that are much happier. Meanwhile, south and west of campus, depending on distance from school, gets pretty sketchy... i would avoid these two areas.\n\nLastly, myself and a few final grad students choose to live in the suburbs and drive to campus. This distant north gets much cheaper than downtown/midtown, and places are bigger and nicer... but you pay with your driving time. Our commute is about 20-30 minutes, and im probably the furthest at about 30 minutes away, living in Marietta. 3 or 4 live in Dunwoody.",

Both perspectives are valid. Whether those of us who are familiar with the program (or at least with the department, as in my case) should encourage you or discourage you from spending half a decade of your life there really depends on what your alternatives are. \n\nSSDL \u2014 which I assume is your lab given your comment about astrodynamics/GNC \u2014 is a great lab and you\u2019ll likely be a part of fantastic research, and you may or may not be actively involved in flight projects as well. \n\nAt the same time, SSDL/GTAE is neither the only place, nor the absolute best place, where you can do either or both of those things.

        "selftext": "hi. i know i am in the same boat as so many other upperclassmen. this is not a new rant. but here we are. i\u2019m a third year and have been very lucky to live on campus for the last 3 years (first year dorm and two years in nav in the same room ((ik, i am very lucky, but it would seem my luck has run out)) \n\nanywho. filled out the housing intention form on tuesday in 22 seconds LIKE THE OTHER TWENTY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE, AND BECAUSE IM NOT A CS MAJOR USING BOTS AND OTHER TOOLS, MY RENT IS ABOUT TO GO UP A FEW HUNDRED A MONTH NEXT SEMESTER. \n\nand i know you\u2019re like \u201clive in home park, live off west, live in a new building, etc etc.\u201d which are all valid reasons, but i will not be doing that. i\u2019m a girl, i value close to campus safety, i do not plan on commuting. i am lucky to have support from my parents, i am in state, so while its still ass expensive, it\u2019s not infeasible, but hear me when i say it\u2019s incredibly unfair and fucking ridiculous. \n\nall of the housing options are just playing games with student\u2019s expenses. on campus housing knows off campus is expensive so on campus raises their rates (i\u2019m already paying like 1250 or something for fucking nav) and then off campus matches them again and raises rates again. huh???? to add onto that, on campus sells the waitlist email lists to westmar and paloma and others. just rubbing salt in the wound. \n\nAND THEN TO CAP THIS OFF, you open instagram and see tech admin posted \u201crecord number of first year admits! beating records again!\u201d STOP LETTING MORE PEOPLE IN THERE IS NOWHERE TO AFFORDABLY LIVE!! let\u2019s go back to being smaller and elitist. \n\nmy situation aside, my luck aside, i know there are many others in worse situations than mine, i recognize that and i am not diminishing their experience, but rather wanting to rant about the infrastructure epidemic unfolding on campus, that systems like housing and residence life do nothing to fix. three billion dollar endowment and for what \ud83e\udd28 me to pay 1600 for a 3x3 at sq5?! huh?? \n\ngeorgia fucking tech, get your fucking shit together. this is neither progress nor service. institute of bad technology.

There are efforts being made around campus to expand those student services (I heard something about construction of more dorms), but not fast enough to keep up with the rate at which GT is accepting new students.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s good they continue to provide access to Georgia Tech and more students without reducing their acceptance rate as aggressively, it really seems unsustainable to keep increasing the number of first-year admits accepted each year without noticeably reducing the quality of the student experience. Although I don\u2019t see this negatively affecting things like research money/prestige, academic rankings, graduation rates, etc. that are the most pressing concerns for the admin.",

Tech can and probably should drop the instate admit rate to make the school a bit more competitive and also decrease the pressure on infrastructure. The impact of that on prestige is a separate conversation but from where I stand it isn't a bad thing.   \n\n\nPrimary, admin needs to recognize that GT cannot grow by a huge amount without growing its services. While decreasing admit rates to give infrastructure more breathing room may decrease access, it lets GT make school itself cheaper by increasing how many people can be on-campus and not pay inflated rates off campus.",

If you want Tech to admit fewer students, the number of OOS and international students would have to drop too.\u00a0\n\n60% is not an unreasonable percentage given Tech is a public university. Most of our public peers have much harsher in-state/OOS restrictions than that. UNC is required by the NC legislature to be 82% in-state. UT Austin is always over 90% in-state because of its unique admissions process. UVA is required by its state legislature to be 2/3rds in state IIRC. The State of CA recently dropped the hammer on OOS admissions in the UC System.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely not a bad thing that the State of GA wants to keep schools 60% in-state and should the opposite happen, you\u2019ll get a situation like CA where several schools are on Tech\u2019s level but the general perception (which does not match reality) is that none of them are actually accessible to students from CA.

Most people will tell you your threads dont matter but id say they kind of do bc the selection of classes in intel is so useless if u dont fall into those categories. Ur learning introductory topics that are difficult to understand and putting urself through multiple stages of hell (getting the class bc of how little seats there are, shitty profs, bad grades) to take them just to never use them in industry bc u need higher level education and experience to land those jobs/research. even a master's in ML will probably not get u a job in ML because there aren't many entry level roles in ML. so even with a master's, ur still looking for a normal swe job.\n\nSpeaking in a career-focused perspective, most CS majors just wanna become a SWE and id say the only benefit i got out of intel is that all the higher level classes use python and it helped me switch from java to python in my leetcode. If u jus wanna be a SWE, id take like Info/sysarch or like info/devices or even like info/people for a balanced schedule. the reason i say info is because the classes teach u things u'll actually get asked about in an interview like i was asked about like databases, caching and load balancing (cs 2200 stuff), networking, TCP/IP. Actually learning C/C++/Linux/Java is better than Intel.",

However, everyone around you at Tech is just like you in terms of the level of success they had in high school. A new bell curve is made out of brilliant students from all over the world when you start out at a school like this - which means that being an \u201caverage\u201d student isn\u2019t a bad thing at all. \n\nMy advice would be to do your best to remove your grades from being a part of your self-worth at all. It is important to realize that you are much more than whatever grade you got on your last test. Tech is a grueling experience for most every student, and heaping more stress and pressure on yourself isn\u2019t going to do any good. \n\nThere will be highs and lows, but I promise it will all even out in the end. I can tell you from my own experience that my very worst grade at Tech (a D) was in a class regarding a very specialized field. I ended up getting a job in that very same field, and have been very successful in my career so far relative to my peers. It goes to show that a grade isn\u2019t even necessarily an indicator of future proficiency in that subject, so why go as far to let it determine the way you view yourself as a person? \n\nJust do your best, join some clubs, get involved with some cool projects and enjoy the ride! It will be over before you know it, and you\u2019ll be looking back on your time at Tech with fond memories.",

Trust me though, that will fade in junior/senior year when the courses get tougher and that head start will mean less and less.  Most likely, there is nobody in your 1332 class would be able to implement a neural network, explain ed25519 elliptic curve cryptography, or describe SSL certificate chaining; these are all things *you* have the potential to learn at GT.\n\nAlso, an 88 is not a bad grade for a 1332 test.

And that a C is supposed to be the average, and he wasn't going to curve the exam.\n\nThat was definitely a reality check. I applied myself better, and remembered that lesson, and ended up getting an A in the class, a 4.0 for my freshman year, and graduated with a 3.89 GPA.\n\nYes, it will be ok.

I transferred in from way south ga in Spring 2008 and almost flunked out within 6 weeks. Ultimately, I changed majors, cut back my hours at work, and really spent time figuring myself out and spent time asking myself what I really wanted. I got in as a nuclear major, but changed to electrical and it was the best decision I ever made. I then reached out during my second semester in the fall to the email lists for the entire DSP class asking if anyone wanted to study - and a few people responded that I still consider great friends today. I got out in May 2011 and wouldn't change a thing - especially the difficult soul searching.\n\nI think alot of the pressure and self doubt for me came from constantly being told I was smart or clever by friends and family and being a relatively big fish in a backwater small pond. The best advice for that is find what makes you happy, latch onto it, and see where it leads. I still remember there was one particular day that the sun came out and I sat outside in the garden across from the library with some good music playing and then I remember just riding the bus a couple laps around campus aimlessly. Something about it just felt good.\n\nHang in there and if you need any support, I and many others are here for you. It takes hard work and dedication to get what you want, but sometimes you might realize that you gotta shake things up a bit or find your stride.",

GT has always been my dream school and I thought this would be the place I\u2019d finally settle down, but since coming here, it\u2019s been really hard to find my place. I met a few people in my FASET group, but we\u2019re all different majors and some of them commute so we\u2019re not super close. I tried informal rush but got dropped by every sorority. However, I\u2019m mostly concerned about the competitive culture. I knew it would difficult, but I\u2019d heard my classes would be more collaborative than I\u2019ve experienced them to be. I\u2019ve found it very hard to do group work or ask for help in my classes. I\u2019ll reach out to my group with questions about lecture or hw and they will either not respond or say they didn\u2019t see my message until after the hw/exam passes. I\u2019m fine with going to OH, but I feel some questions don\u2019t need to be directly answered by the professor when a simple text can suffice. At my old school my friends and I would study together and help each other as much as possible. I just thought that was the norm. I get the vibe that students here think helping others is in some way disadvantaging them. So I ask\u2026does it get better? Is this just typical of intro courses and people will warm up over time? I\u2019m seriously contemplating switching schools again. I\u2019m tired and just want to be settled in somewhere. App deadlines are coming up and I need to figure out what to do. What are y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",

They all study together, while I do my homework alone. I've also haven't been able to establish a bond with my roommates either. It's tough sometimes, but GaTech was also one of my dream schools. I'm grateful to my PI who took me in his lab, and I love the work I get to do here. I think it's a slow process, especially if you transfer over. It's not all that bad though. My labmates have been very nice, and they've kept me going so far. I also managed to talk regularly to a few folks in my classes.Try joining a club, or sign up for activities! I think it will take time, and will be slow as hell, but I guess you gotta push through if everything else is to your liking.",

These are students/peers that are likely struggling to balance their own studies and lives, just like you.  They aren\u2019t tutors or TAs, or even people that have signed up to be in a peer study group.  They certainly have no obligation to teach class material via text message.  What might feel like quick questions to ask likely would take a meaningful amount of thought and time to put a response together for you.\n\nExpecting other students to give their time to help you out in your classes is a not a normal expectation to have.  If you find a friends group that makes time to study together, that\u2019s awesome and those things exist. But that\u2019s not what the group in a group project is meant for. If you need help learning the material so that you can contribute to the group assignments, that\u2019s really on you to find mechanisms meant to help people study/learn.  Office hours like you mentioned, study groups, tutors, etc.\n\nGood luck!",

I've made a couple friends and also just everyday mundane things seem nicer at my new school (pretty campus, friendlier students/profs, less people in classes, etc.) I'm not going to lie, I was a little worried about how transferring so many times might look to future applications but I was just accepted into an internship at an ivy with that on my record so idk how much it matters.

New additions to the courts are Pickleball and a Roller Derby practice track.\n\nSome photos can be found here: https://imgur.com/a/nVMqXYb\n\nIf you wish to reserve Peter's Parking Deck, reach out to us via email, and we'll work to get your event in place.\n\nThanks, all, for your patience!",

Most of the active people there are some flavor of ADHD or autistic or both; makes for some very invigorating conversations.\n\nThe anime club feels a bit more sporadic and less 'family like' if that makes any sense, but it still has a lot of wonderful people (and organized board game nights).",

Seems like pretty bad advice, but let me explain:\n\nAt least from what I've seen, most people that go to clubs are there for an hour and just leave and return the next week. I pulled the same thing my first two semesters at Tech and I felt the same way. Honestly, that is expected. I think many people forget that a club isn't just a 1 hour a week thing, but something you actively engage in. You get what you put in. If you go for an hour and don't stick around after meeting chatting with people, you find yourself in that position where you go home and think \"Time to wait another week to go back to club to talk to no one\". For a ton of the people I see attend aniclub (the club Im most active in), they never really stick around to hang out after we are finished watching shows and I never get the opportunity to meet them because of that. I can say the same for myself when I stayed in my dorm 90% of the day and didn't try to go to unofficial club events. No one ever got the opportunity to talk to me because I never gave myself the chance to put myself out there and try to start conversation after/during meeting times.\n\nThat is where I think clubs like D&amp;D and Anime Club shine. D&amp;D I think is the more obvious example of this. You aren't actively playing D&amp;D (p2e on top btw) during club. Instead, you find a game and play it outside of club time. Before you know it, you are actively hanging out with the people you play with on the weekends outside of session because you put yourself in that situation where you form bonds. For anime club, we have a channel called #culc-cult in the discord where most people will ping if we are all hanging out in Crosland or we will post when we all go out to dinner after meetings, or even board game night. If you look hard enough, every club has something like this.\n\nAnyways I'm writing all of this to say to not let that twice a month meeting time limit you. Maybe message the main slack or discord channel and see if anyone wants to make plans, or if that is too much, try taking small steps and meeting a couple people that regularly attend and hang out with them",

My student org was having a meeting while the PA system was blasting just constant curse words. That stuff doesn't normally bother me, it was going on last semester but this semester it just got way way worse. With this music playing all the way across the student center and having heard songs graphically describing fingerbanging and violence against women, it's really a problem. Even more so because this was during the swim meet yesterday where hundreds of children are getting lunch at chick-fil-a, and kids are touring the school, its a really bad look for us.\n\nI'd honestly like it if they just turned the music off entirely, because it's hard to study with that going on constantly, but please at least stop playing constant explicit music.",

Not to mention, it's a public building, so there are always going to be rational limits on what can be played there. If you still want to listen to such music, that's what earbuds are for. Ofc, I don't know what songs they're referring to and if they're overreacting, but if they aren't then this seems like a valid conplaint.",

The same people whose dopamine receptors are fried from scrolling tiktok and IG reels at the same time. When someone defends the Stucen music that not only plays inside but through the outside speakers, blasting across tech green all I hear is \u201cI can\u2019t enjoy this public space without some kind of distraction from my own thoughts!\u201d Alright bro we get it. You enjoy being blasted with royalty free music like you have some kind of anti homeless architecture fetish.\n\n\nLike bro, if you want music so bad feel free to wear headphones- they have the added benefit of playing whatever you want! If you legitimately enjoy listening to the same top fifty pop songs someone chose for you idk what to tell you man, you\u2019re cooked. You probably have subway surfers gameplay going while you\u2019re in lecture.\n\n\nIt just really takes away from the versatility of the Stucen. Strangely enough, if you go to the Stucen after dark when all the food places are closed, you\u2019ll be strangely hard pressed to find any of these so-called Stucen enjoyers \ud83e\udd14 funnily enough, everyone who\u2019s there is on their laptop studying or doing homework. So we can really just dismiss this whole \u201crecreational aspect\u201d of it- after dark anyways. How about we just agree that this building is a multi use space that should be kept as versatile as possible.

The student center hosts events like open mics, concerts, and there's even a dedicated space for the musician's network to mess around with instruments. And these things can go on past 10. The student center literally wasn't designed to be a study space, it was made for students to hang out, socialize, eat, and be entertained. Of course there will be music. If OP thinks the music is too explicit, that's a valid complaint. However, complaining that you can't study in the student center really isn't.

It's a much better idea to have each bin type in the same location. Going to a further bin the app suggested is even more friction.\n\nI could see using something like wave an item over an edge device right above the trash bins that identified the item.",

I will definitely mention this issue with the GT recycling coordinator Malte Weiland and see if we can get some improved signage on those bins this semester.\n\nContamination is definitely one of the primary issues we are trying to address by giving accurate rules through the ECGO app, but you are right, signage is immediately accessible and we have heard anecdotes from some recycling coordinators that great signage can lead to both lower contamination and higher engagement.\n\nIn regards to your idea about edge devices, both Scrapp and Oscar Sort are trying out these approaches with mixed success. The unfortunate aspect of edge devices is their upfront cost, continued maintenance, and propensity to be stolen. Furthermore, we believe that although there are improvements to be made at the bin, the biggest oversight in recycling in the US is the lack of community/culture and direct incentives. We believe these are best delivered and scaled through an in-app experience and we have big plans to substantially improve both for the Fall semester.",

                        "body": "**Item #:** SCP-GT \n\n**Object Class:** ~~Euclid~~ Keter (Reclassified following the \"Incident of 17\")\n\n~~Special Containment Procedures: SCP-GT is to be contained within a habitat enclosure at Site-\u2588\u2588 that simulates an urban campus environment, complete with artificial turf and structures reminiscent of a traditional college campus. The enclosure must be equipped with advanced security measures to prevent SCP-GT from breaching containment, including electromagnetic barriers, motion sensors, and a 24/7 surveillance system. Interaction with SCP-GT is to be limited to personnel with Level 3 clearance and above, and any maintenance or research within the enclosure must be conducted under strict supervision. Personnel engaging with SCP-GT must wear standard issue protective gear to prevent potential harm caused by SCP-GT's unpredictable behavior. In case of a containment breach, Protocol GT-Alpha is to be initiated, involving the use of specialized acoustic devices designed to pacify SCP-GT and guide it back to its enclosure. Description: SCP-GT appears as a large, metallic creature resembling a yellow jacket wasp, an entity closely associated with the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). Despite its metallic structure, SCP-GT exhibits organic behaviors such as territorial displays, vocalizations reminiscent of traditional college chants, and high levels of agility and strength. SCP-GT possesses the ability to inspire and invigorate individuals around it, particularly those affiliated with or supportive of Georgia Tech. SCP-GT's origin remains unknown, but it was first contained following a series of events at Georgia Tech where it was observed leading rallies and participating in sports events, causing significant disturbances due to its anomalous abilities and the fervor it incited in the populace. Addendum GT-1: SCP-GT has demonstrated a unique ability to affect technological devices within its vicinity, often causing them to operate at significantly enhanced efficiency levels. This effect seems to be beneficial, although the potential for SCP-GT to inadvertently compromise electronic security measures necessitates further study. Addendum GT-2: Incident GT-5 occurred on \\[REDACTED\\], when SCP-GT breached containment during the annual \"Homecoming\" event at Georgia Tech. SCP-GT was observed leading a parade, with numerous individuals, both students, and faculty, following it in a state of heightened excitement. The event resulted in minor property damage but no casualties. SCP-GT returned to its containment voluntarily after approximately 2 hours. The incident has led to a revision of containment protocols to include countermeasures for specific Georgia Tech events.~~\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Following the \"Incident of 17\", SCP-GT's containment protocols have been significantly revised. SCP-GT is now housed in a high-security Keter-class containment facility at Site-\u2588\u2588, specifically designed to mitigate its enhanced capabilities and prevent any form of external influence or escape. The containment facility is equipped with multiple redundant security layers, including electromagnetic barriers capable of nullifying SCP-GT's anomalous effects, vibration-dampening walls to counteract its acoustic influence, and a Faraday cage to prevent its interaction with electronic devices. All personnel interactions with SCP-GT, including maintenance, research, and security operations, are to be conducted remotely or via autonomous drones. Direct human contact is strictly forbidden without approval from the O5 Council, given SCP-GT's demonstrated ability to manipulate human emotions and technology. In the event of a containment breach, Protocol GT-Kappa is to be immediately enacted, involving site-wide lockdown, deployment of Mobile Task Forces equipped with specialized anomalous countermeasures, and activation of the site's Scranton Reality Anchors to negate SCP-GT's abilities.\n\n**Description:** SCP-GT is a highly advanced, anomalous entity with the appearance of a metallic yellow jacket wasp, emblematic of the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). SCP-GT exhibits both organic and mechanical characteristics, with the ability to exert control over technology and influence human emotions, particularly those related to competitiveness and loyalty to Georgia Tech. SCP-GT's reclassification to Keter was necessitated by the Incident of 17, where it demonstrated previously unseen capabilities, including mass emotional manipulation, spontaneous generation of technological constructs, and a significant resistance to previously effective containment measures.\n\n**Addendum GT-1:** The Incident of 17 occurred during an unauthorized testing phase, where SCP-GT managed to override its containment field, resulting in a campus-wide blackout and the temporary loss of control over several Foundation assets. SCP-GT mobilized a large group of civilians and personnel, instigating a large-scale event that mimicked a campus riot. The incident resulted in multiple casualties and significant damage to Foundation property.\n\n**Addendum GT-2:** SCP-GT's influence over technology and human behavior is more profound than initially assessed. It can induce a highly competitive and aggressive state in individuals, significantly enhancing their physical capabilities and technological understanding, albeit at the cost of their rationality and awareness of their surroundings.\n\n**Note:** SCP-GT has become a subject of interest within the Foundation not only for its unique characteristics but also for the potential application of its technology-enhancing abilities. Research proposals aimed at understanding and possibly harnessing this aspect of SCP-GT are currently under review. However, SCP-GT's ability to inspire extreme loyalty and its control over technology pose a significant threat not only to the structural integrity of the Foundation but also to the global balance of power should its influence extend beyond containment. Ongoing research focuses on understanding the full extent of SCP-GT's capabilities and developing more effective containment and countermeasures.",

Like when having the thought \"ugh I know I have to still do this shit\" hanging over my head, and then simultaneously being frustrated that I still couldn't bring myself to start, I learned to shift my focus to doing something easy to do that didn't feel like work, even if it seemed like an extremely small baby step.\n\nFor example: If I have this whole problem set to do and I haven't even started it yet and I realize (as you have) that the anxiety alone is not helping (maybe making things worse). In this case I would instead shift to thinking of how I can make it easier for my future self to do the work. I can pull out my laptop and open up the problem set from canvas. That's easy. I'll work on it later but I've done that step. I can take out my notes from the past week so they're ready for me to look through them. Not stressful. Well, now that I have it open, I but I can at least read through the problems, even if I need to study later to fully understand them. If some feel easy to knock out, maybe I'll start them now, maybe later. Right now it's late, if I think  I'm not going to be productive tonight anyway, I can force myself to sleep (or just rest in bed without devices) make sure I waking up earlier and I'll have everything ready for me to start\n\nThis method isn't a panacea, but it is something that cumulatively made a big difference over my years at Tech. And if this isn't the right method for you, I'm sure you will find your own way to make your intelligence work best for you. Best of luck!",

Failed every single one of them. \n\nI reached a point where I was so irritated, so hateful, so dissapointed with myself, with how I was living my life, with the amount of work I was getting done, with my direction in life, that I hit this rock bottom. It was like this implosion of hate that finally ignited a something in my heart that made never again be that hateful and dissapointed with myself, this burning desire to *be better.*\n\nAnd so I started living my life/studying with imagining *the person that I would be proud of* versus *who I was now*. By working towards an *ideal* and away from my biggest demon: laziness (procrastination, partying, videogames.), I had my motivation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what Im talking about isnt a trick, or a tip, for getting into a 4 hr work session. Its a paradigm change. Its a different perspective for living life. The problem is not you cannot find you motivation externally in the world, I believe it is that you do not have motivation existing in your heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet the world go for a few. Take some time. Go to a mountain top or something. Write in a journal. Find what you want to work towards, a dream, a goal, and let your passion for the future or your hate for the present spurn your will for change. *This*, in the long run, will give you motivation that burns for much longer than 11:55 pm energy\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, just for clarification, this is my own way of seeing things, and I know I said a lot, probably an unexpected response. I dont mean to convince you or \"convert\" you or anything like that. Just sharing some of my thoughts that I think could help you.",

My groupmate emailed them (on a Friday) for the first big assignment (due on a Monday) because there was no rubric or real guidelines posted for it. No response, and we all got docked off 10%+ for not including items that were never specified to us. Only feedback was to \"answer more specifically\". \n\nThis week, we have a pretty critical discrepancy in our results ie it makes no physical sense. We group emailed the TA and prof on Wednesday, only got a response from the TA saying they were unsure and asking the prof if they have any ideas. We emailed back to the group email both yesterday and today, still no response from prof. This assignment is also due Monday before class, which is the only time we see the prof in person. I wish I had the foresight to identify future obstacles (on Monday, when we see them in class) we may run into for an assignment assigned Wed and due Mon, but alas. Any outside of class communication feels impossible. \n\nOffice hours are by appointment only, which is kind of difficult to schedule if we just get ghosted by email. I pulled up to their office a couple times and they were not there. We're just gonna have to BS this assignment and chalk it up to human errors probably, even though I'm 99% sure there's more to it than that. But in the future, how do we deal with an unresponsive prof if the TA is unable to help? Just deal and survive the semester? Anyone else we can go to outside of the instructional team? I'm almost out of here, this just sucks. Thanks friends \ud83e\udee1",

Facebook groups are the best way imo. Its hard tho, so good luck. U may have to be willing to negotiate",

I just don't think it's feasible to open a proper restaurant because to have any type of 'authentic' feel, you need a lot of spices and condiments that require (in the US) non-native ingredients meaning that if you want authentic food, it's $30 or more if you want it to be a full meal but those types of restaurants don't really suit the lifestyle of a college student. So I think it's not really feasible, on the other hand, I'm really surprised there isn't a food truck of pani-puri/dosas and indian snack food, I think that's pretty doable",

My PI; however, did not tell me that I would need to be using the web-clock on OneUSG to log my hours. This was a miscommunication on their part as they likely assumed I was already using it for my other position, which I am not because my supervisor puts in our time manually. \n\nSo, I worked 9 hours during the first 2 weeks of school and did not log them, which means I was not compensated. I immediately emailed them when I figured that out and their attitude was very much \u201cyou should\u2019ve logged them\u201d and they essentially ignored any email I sent requesting and update on whether or not they were able to get in contact with payroll and fix it.\n\nThese past 2 weeks, I made sure to log my time. There were some mistakes on my timesheet because the website is super glitchy so it logged my in time on one position and despite me setting the page to be on that position, switched to my other position when I punched out so that had to be corrected. I worked over 11 hours over the past 2 weeks and this morning I noticed that my time had been changed to 5.2 hours, which means I am now missing 15 hours worth of compensation. \n\nI also put in an inquiry with OneUSG and apparently my PI is the only one who can fix it \ud83d\ude42\n\nI emailed my PI about this again and included the live document my team has been using to log our hours week to week, but I\u2019m almost positive they\u2019re going to ignore it and at this point I\u2019m considering not working at all until I am fairly compensated.

If that doesn\u2019t work then you probably need to ask your PI if you all can set up a meeting with whoever in your department works with grants to see the most appropriate solution to getting the back pay fixed. If the PI stonewalls you at that point your options are (1) ombud (2) Dean of students (3) department chair. Not in that order specifically. \n\nUsually the best course of action is to find a way to resolve the issue without requiring additional paperwork. You may have slightly higher taxes inputting in more hours but at the number of hours you are putting in it would be negligible and wouldn\u2019t affect your overall end of year tax burden. \n\nUnfortunately these issues are not gatech or even higher education specific, though you see them happen at research universities when faculty who are trained in X field are tasked with work beyond their training (finance, administration, etc.) bc we in academia somehow think a PHD and a faculty job grant us magical powers. \n\nHope this helps.\n\nOne last note: a good phrase to have in your arsenal now and forever is \u201cI can\u2019t continue to work without appropriate compensation, what can we do to resolve this issue? Who can we talk to to get this resolved?\u201d Approach it as a problem to solve together not as an adversarial situation, and it can help. But stand your ground on getting a timely resolution.",

But also, you are robbing your team of productivity.

On the flip side, working hard through issues can be a positive note on recommendation letters.\n\nEdit: Of course, as with all work issues, the best course of action is largely influenced by the trustworthiness/professionalism of those involved. So if your PI has a history of being unprofessional and screwing over others, then i would ignore my prior advice... and likewise, immediately quit and not ever work with them.",

This will vary by department/building and where exactly you're getting your funding from. \n\nI wouldn't withhold work, but if needed elevate this above your PI if they aren't being responsive.

To be honest, your relationship with your PI is more valuable in the long term if you have any designs for graduate school, so keep that in mind before you might cause a schism. To resolve the hours issue, go talk to the department office your PI is in to talk to the finance person. They have ultimate authority over this, not your PI.",

I'm a student at GaTech, and I borrowed a Microsoft Surface laptop from the college for coursework. Unfortunately, I entrusted my laptop to a friend to submit in the library, but he mistakenly handed it over to the IT department instead.\n\nNow, the library is insisting that they never received the laptop, and they're asking me to pay a hefty $1500 fee. When I approached the IT department, they claimed they don't have the laptop either. I'm at a loss for what to do next.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation before? Are there any steps I can take to track down my laptop or resolve this issue with the library and IT department? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!",

Make sure that you mention that you've been experiencing both things.\n\nYou don't want to mess around and delay too much when one of your symptoms is numbness, because that points to your nerves possibly being involved.

Check the syllabus beforehand so you can be well-informed of their policies, but still ask even if the syllabus mentions the official channels. Depending on if you plan to pursue option 3, be frank but professional. Technically they're supposed to ask you to keep details confidential, but a little honesty can go a long ways. Above all, COVID has encouraged them to insist that you not come when truly sick. Do with that info what you will, considering periods aren't contagious XD\n\nIf the prof requests proof or you suspect will be difficult: \n\nOption 2: STAMPS\n(The one time I managed to get an appt they were closed when I got there. No particular advice. I have heard that the women's health department is pretty good from a decent amount of ppl, but overall the place has a rather mixed bag of feedback.)\n\n\nOption 3 (particularly if stamps has no appts, if you are in too much pain to want to leave, and/or have insurance that covers it nicely) teledoc or other virtual appt. Your goal is a doctor's note, that goes to the office of the dean. They send you an official letter back to forward to the prof, but bewarned, how exactly any makeup is handled still depends on the prof. I recommend checking their syllabus still. Obviously what the doc writes on the note depends on the person, and on what you say or ask (including Rx)\n\n\nAs a fellow woman, I agree with these other commentors that you should seek medical advice if you can!",

For now it's a completely casual spot for like-minded people, but if there's enough ideas and interest, maybe a club revival could happen some day...

I will say that it used to be centered on a groupMe chat and before that it was centered on a Facebook group. I think that discord is a good platform for these kinds of things although discover ability isn't amazing, there is an official campus integration on discord that allows you to link servers to a particular campus but I'm not sure how used / useful it is.",

I honestly don\u2019t like groupme because of the UI and lack of features for group management and organization; I think discord does it much much better in that regard. The campus integration isn\u2019t bad either, as it allows students to directly search to see if there\u2019s a club they are interested in, but as for finding small interest groups, it\u2019s a bit harder in that regard since the servers are sorted by member count.",

I'm a grad student in my last semester so I won't be around for too long but I've joined the discord for this semester. For the project we're also interested in how to get people to meet up in-person on campus. In the old photography club we did I think bi-weekly meetings with photo &amp; editing critiques and competitions on the overhead projectors; workshops on different techniques and technical aspects of photography. Also club trips to places like the Atlanta Zoo and Botanical Gardens, I think some areas of the Greenway etc. Thanks for creating the Discord though, I think that there definitely should be a photography group on campus as a club or otherwise.",

It's different than, \"I wish I went to GT instead of getting a job at a convenience store.\" Even so, what if that convenience store grew from one location to 2300 and you became VP of the Southeast Region. You just have no idea how a branch of history would go if one variable was changed. Clearly everyone posting here has not yet graduated, or you would have more mature answers.\n\nAlso, are you jealous that our in-state rivals have better athletics and worse academics?

This involved reorganizing our list, introducing new item categories, and consolidating from 1000+ items to just over 200.\u00a0\n\nIn collaboration with recycling coordinators, we've been working to gather accurate information on the recyclability of each item. Today, we're excited to announce that this updated information is now live!\u00a0\n\n**What This Means For You** \ud83d\udc65\u00a0\n\nPrior to obtaining this revised list, our team and app were operating with outdated information. As a result, some recyclable items submitted by our users (*you amazing folks*) may have been erroneously rejected.\n\nRest assured, our team spent this last weekend meticulously reviewing all user submissions to rectify any mistakes. However, we want to ensure you are well-informed. Please feel free to check your deposit history, and if you notice any discrepancies, don't hesitate to reach out to support within the app or send us an email at [hello@ecgo.co](mailto:hello@ecgo.co).\n\nWe genuinely appreciate your understanding and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience.\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t yet downloaded the app, join us by signing up through the link below! \ud83d\udc47\n\n[ECGO: Snap. Recycle. Reward!](https://ecgo-mobile.app.link/8Qb0JzxMWGb)\n\nThank you for being part of our eco-conscious community! \u267b\ufe0f\n\nBest regards,\u00a0\n\nRyan and the ECGO Team",

However, blood tests and other types of exams can be expensive (but still cheaper! than in many non-campus clinics) depending on what your symptoms are. I had some gallbladder-liver issues last semester and paid about $500 in blood tests (but it was a LOT of blood tests), which I now have a claim with my outside insurance for, trying to get it back.\n\nSchool insurance is really unnecessary because it's way more expensive per semester than any out-of-pocket you would possibly pay. Also, if you are lucky to have outside insurance, you can always either file a claim, or the doctor will send you to outside institutions for any CT/MRI/other medical tests that require a referral. And with outside insurance, these tests go down in price from thousands of dollars to literally 40 bucks. Even blood tests tbh, but I didn't realize this early enough.\n\nIf you don't have even outside insurance, then you are more unlucky, but at the very least you should go to a doctor's visit because they are free. And even though you'll pay out-of-pocket for the blood tests, you should still take them if your doctor wants you to, because blood tests have valuable information that could narrow down your diagnosis. Then at least you'll know how serious your condition is, and you could start talking about options. One thing to remember is that stress alone can cause so many weird conditions, that if you are constantly in stress, it's worth considering ways to destress, or minimizing stressors because they can seriously detrimental to your health. And you'll know if your stress levels are through the roof enough for this to be a possible cause.",

Even non-degree, classes had pre-reqs so permission is needed. This was done in order to demonstrate my aptitude on my application in changing from a Business major bachelors degree straight to an Engineering PhD.

Nelson and Shell, this semester alone, has had the water cut off completely atleast 5 times now, each times lasting many hours past their emailed time expectations. \n\nNot only this, but on unrelated occasions the hot water is turned off with no prior warning. Today the hot water has been turned off again, and there was literally no email sent. I had to call the office and be told that the hot water was turned off. \u201cIt should have been emailed.\u201d The \u201cit should\u201d seems to be their go to at this point. It should but it never actually is. \n\nNot to mention the fact that The director for Nelson Shell, literally ignored my emails twice. Each time for separate issues. She\u2019ll respond to the first one asking for more information, and then never actually acts or even has the common decency to reply to my email with additional information. What\u2019s ironic is that the first email has plenty of information to begin with\u2026. \n\nI could write a 3 page paper about all of the issues of the dorm, but it\u2019s pointless because housing could literally care less.",

They got the flooding under wraps in okay time (like, just one full day) but would not help dry out his flooded room. Say Friday it leaked, Sunday they put those floppy gray pads in his room and the living room. Monday they came and removed the pads and fucked off. Tuesday they came and then talked to one of the roommates and left. Finally by Wednesday they put some damn fans in his room. Meanwhile he couldnt sleep in that undoubtedly biohazard room and it smelled like ass, so he slept on the couch in the still moist living room. \n\nEvery day he called either emergency maintenance or RA on duty and just got told it wasn't an emergency. Kind of is urgent if you have active mold growing and the things in his room are on a time limit before they get permanently damaged. If they just did their job the first day they came to dry shit out it wouldve been easier for everyone my brother in Christ. Nelson Shell as well btw",

        "selftext": "Since we've had an uncommonly cold winter for Atlanta, a lot of the pipes have burst in old buildings like north avenue. Unfortunately this caused flooding and now they have to do repairs. However, not only were we not informed that these repairs were going underway, we were also not told that they would be going into our apartments without prior warning.\n\nI was taking a test for a class on honorlock when suddenly someone started hammering the wall next to mine. There was also sawing and drilling, just all kinds of noises and there were no emails or no postings about the fact that this would be in my kitchen and living room.\n\nThey also ripped the floor out in the kitchen. My living room is not accessible, it has a giant tarp covering it. The entire space smells like toxic fumes and I wear a mask when I am out of my room.\n\n[They took out the floor of my kitchen without telling me. Now the floor is sticky and it all smells like toxic fumes.](https://preview.redd.it/3pr6c3fno3gc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3542c23c39d3e3cc22c6b24b6fc069860d50da59)\n\n[They took out kitchen cabinets and the wall.](https://preview.redd.it/njzpw89zp3gc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb65a3aef6e80f9941d464554ea16b7ba3e24ad0)\n\n[My living room. They took everything from our cabinets and put it on the floor in the living room. It is unusable.](https://preview.redd.it/npjw7nf1q3gc1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6c106497e10abc3b08d240e99f666a873e612a2)\n\nAfter they've been working on my floor for the past 2 weeks (they've been IN my apartment for 3 of those days), we all got the following email. It says we will receive an individual notice if they will do something with our apartment, but I still have not gotten said email...\n\n[Look at this shit](https://preview.redd.it/hlobw6hvn3gc1.png?width=539&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b73d036abfb82a9611e535d5590c87f9f6a05e6)\n\nThe cherry on top of this disaster: my ethernet was out for two straight weekends and my roommate lost power to all outlets in his room.\n\nI am extremely upset and disappointed in the way GT is handling this. Anyone else in the same boat?\n\nEdit: I am currently trapped in my room. I woke up and the kitchen floor and bathroom floor were torn out and have this glue on them. A contractor was there and he told me that I can't walk on it. Updating because people dismissed the problem since we were given an email and got 'compensation' (I got $200 dining dollars) for this. Currently requesting to move to another location during repairs. I got an email about my room needing rennovation and to pack up my stuff, nothing can be on the floors or on any desks. I called the housing office today to find out more about the repairs they would be doing and, moving up the chain of command, I am waiting to hear back. I really have to go to the bathroom, so hoping to be able to use it soon (cannot leave room or use bathroom because kitchen floor has paste on it that I was told not to walk on).",

This historic venue has been a goal for many students to walk across the stage and complete their prestigious degree. \nMost of the undergraduates attending this ceremony will be those who did not receive a normal high school graduation ceremony because they are 2020 grads, so this could be the first and only time they and their families would have the chance to see them walk across the stage.\nThe benefit of Bobby Dodd that is also being overlooked is the ability for as many friends and family members to attend graduation. Many students' families have made travel plans around the graduation schedule that has been around for years. Now, these family members may not be able to attend a once-in-a-lifetime ceremony for many because of the ticket limits. We also will not be able to have other friends who have not yet graduated or are in other ceremonies attend the graduation, which has long been a benefit of unlimited seating in Bobby Dodd. \nWe request the Georgia Tech administration and President Cabrera to move the Spring 2024 graduation back to Bobby Dodd. If the weather is inclement, McCamish as an emergency plan is understandable, but it is not understandable why we have this long tradition of walking across Grant Field taken from thousands of Georgia Tech students.",

Also I went to my sister\u2019s graduation during COVID at Bobby Dodd and it was so ducking miserably the sun was just on us the entire time. So far away from the walk way could barely see her. The pictures were essentially worthless. and the stadium is so big for the number of people and students it felt kinda empty. Yea the ticket number limit is better but I\u2019ve never known anyone with an issue getting tickets. There\u2019s plenty of opportunities after the initial ticket allotment to get extras. A lot of people don\u2019t even go to graduation and just give them away. Other aholes sell them. And I think the school also gives away any extras in a lottery type system. I graduated in mccamish twice. And my sister I Bobby Dodd once and we all agreed mccamish was way better",

Your petition is a spit in the face of people with family that have conditions where they can\u2019t sit in the shiny bright Bobby Dodd bleachers in the May heat for 2 hours. Just because you and your immediate contacts want something, does not mean that everyone wants it. You\u2019d think as someone graduating from Georgia Tech you\u2019d have the maturity and sense to realize every system has trade offs and opportunity cost. The cost of this system is 4 tickets, but it\u2019s a good solution that the admin has made the decision for. If you can\u2019t narrow down your family to four people and the rest watch virtually and congratulate after, just don\u2019t take any of them and then they\u2019ll all be equal and you\u2019ll be $1000 richer from selling your tickets",

                "body": "I can kind of understand both sides of this. McCamish is better weather-wise and is much better for the comfort of those in attendance. Especially when a graduation a couple of years ago ended abruptly in the middle of a storm.  And you don't have to deal with May heat or the chilly December wind. I graduated from undergrad last May and was apparently the last group to be able to do that and I personally loved it. Sure the heat sucked, but I enjoyed it getting to buzz around the stadium field while hanging out with my friends who are all graduating and take visit where my friends and family were sitting during graduation was super fun. I also loved getting to easily sit through my other friends' graduation with a large group of my friends. I went to the Spring 2022 and Fall 2022 graduations as well and didn't mind anything and liked it. \n\nIn my personal opinion, I think if all the conditions are right then Bobby Dodd is better, but McCamish has way more advantages from a planning perspective and is a safer option for the admin to plan with. There are less issues to worry about and it is the comfortable option. The main issue is the ticketing limits. This past Fall's graduation was in McCamish and it was annoying that I wasn't able to some of my friend's graduations. I got lucky and one guy had an extra ticket for me but other than that, it can be pretty hard. It requires you to know a lot of graduates who might have an extra ticket or be willing to pay someone for a ticket. As far as I know, besides the roll call which is luck-based and you have to go pretty early to get it, some people who really want to go just won't be able to go. I am graduating with my Master's this spring and I don't even have enough for my whole family, and I'm one of the few left who's graduating so a bunch of my friends won't be able to make it in for the ceremony. McCamish is great that it is indoors but it's size really makes it annoying. I personally am hoping for Bobby Dodd but understand why they're doing it in McCamish.",

You still get to shake Cabrera\u2019s hand and receive a rolled up welcome letter from the alumni association. There\u2019s also a benefit that with smaller ceremonies, you spend less time just sitting there listening to names of people you don\u2019t know until you perk up for the ones you do know.\n\nThere is the caveat of the ticket limit, which I do agree is a fair complaint. But it\u2019s not like that completely ruins the ceremony experience for those that can be there. As a 2020 high school grad, my HS ceremony was a bit scuffed, but thankfully *both* ceremonies here have been a step up. Maybe Bobby Dodd feels more \u201ctraditional\u201d with how football has shaped the culture here, but as others have said, McCamish was the actual traditional venue.",

Given that it was a winter graduation, there were of course less graduates. They held engineering, college of sciences, and masters all in the same ceremony. Due to this, they made the college engineering sit IN THE STANDS INSTEAD OF THE FLOOR. I was a spectator at my own graduation and I was quite unhappy about it. I would assume the same or worse with the larger May graduations if they were to be held inside. Weather is always a factor, but I would rather sit on the field and have my entire family be able to see me walk at graduation after 4-5 years of hard work. Move it back outside.",
